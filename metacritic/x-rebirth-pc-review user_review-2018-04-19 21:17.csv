None of the game mechanics are explained in any way and it's a lot more complicated to learn than the previous X games (and that's a huge slap in the face to Egosoft who were apparently trying to make it more accesible). God knows how you trade in this game trade ships are bugged as well. UI is horrendous no FOV options and graphics options are minimal and have no effect on performance. Basically taken everything that was good about X and thrown it out the window. Then released a game which is in Alpha state and charged the same as AAA title... disgracefull. 1/10,2,Played for a few hours and unfortunately that is all I can stand.  There are horrible design choices that utterly ruin the game for me.  Apparently they were going for 'immersion.'  I think what they confused this with suffocating boredom and claustrophobia.

There are horrible design choices that utterly ruin the game for me.  Apparently they were going for 'immersion.'  I think what they confused this with suffocating boredom and claustrophobia.  There is no radar (seriously?!)  and the map system is infinitely worse than in previous games.  Combine this with a cluttered screen due to the overblown  view and zero ability to have an external or free look mode and you literally feel like you have no idea what is going on around you.  This completely ruins the sense of scale that I always enjoyed in previous x games.  Imagine being the vanguard of an entire fleet...well just imagine it cause you can't actually see it....just trust us they're PROBABLY all still behind you.  The menu systems are a step down from previous games the graphics don't feel like an improvement.  The world does feel more 'alive' at times but mainly because they seem to just cram everything together in tighter clusters of activity.  The highway system may seem to have some merit but it feels like this will lead to a lack of exploration as you will inevitably stick close to them.    I won't even touch on the horrible out of ship aspects as I wasn't expecting much and was planning on just giving them a pass as long as the core gameplay remained enjoyable.  Sadly this is not the case and I don't see this game ever becoming something I can actually enjoy. Its truly sad.  Although I am a long time fan of the series I was more than ready to embrace change especially in the name of greater immersion.  But every aspect of the game feels like its a step back in intuitiveness accessibility and actual functionality.  Given this is a sci-fi setting they should be looking to improve these aspects not further cripple them.  (Again no radar?  What are you smoking egosoft?!) Side note I had no performance issues to speak of so none of my frustrations stem from bugs or glitches.  Had that been the case I would simply wait a few weeks or months until things improved.  But with the core gameplay being what it is the game has already been deleted. The one positive to come from this game is that it rekindled my desire to play X3 again.,0,really regret buying this afterbirth feels like I bought an MS-DOS game by mistake.  the graphics are truly terrible  Why are all female characters so fugly in this game?

Here is why: 1) I won't say it's outright broken but they clearly delivered a more than unfinished product. So far i've encountered a hefty amount of serious bugs every half an hour or so my game crashed completely. I'm really asking myself did Egosoft even do any basic bugtesting at all? I know very well that they also released buggy games in the past but this is getting out of control. The trend of releasing untested games needs to stop. Someone has to say something. 2) The bad performance is also a serious issue. I have an I-7 (4.2ghz) GTX 690 4GB and 16GB Ram  yet i'm getting laughable 20-30 FPS average. If i fly into busy areas i get even less FPS same on stations. This is just hilarious and shows how poorly optimized the game is. 3) Many of the core features from the past games were cut away or steamlined beyond recognition. They left out the Warp gates instead you'll get some weird space highways. There is no 3rd person camera anymore and no free look inside your  Many textures are simply low res and look nothing like the beautiful ones from the trailers and gameplay videos. The Story is plain childish. etc. etc. Also the Graphic special effects are very overused. I feel like being in that one simpsons episode where they went to japan and got seizures all the time while watching a flashy gundam show on tv. 4) You only get to fly 1 (in words: ONE) ship in person. Gone are the days when you were able to fly basically any existing ship out there. Now you have to stick with this small Albion Ship for eternity. 5) The UI and menu is simply horrible! I can't tell where the heck my ships are let alone give orders to them. This whole "press enter and do everything from a separate screen" thing is really awful. It feels more like a console port than an improvement of any sort. Basically this is like 3 steps backwards compared to X3:TC. It hurts me to say it but this game is Bad with a capital B! At least give it another 6 months so the community can fix the mess Egosoft released before you even CONCIDER paying money for this game.,1,What do I say? The trailer made it look amazing. All the reviews had nothing negative or constructive to say. I have to wonder if these people were paid. It's buggy unfinished and a lousy port of a console game.

Frankly even if this gets launched on consoles it will flop there also. There are some good concepts With some updates and work this game could be redeemed but right now It was no way fit for launch. 3rd game I have waited for a purchased recently  in which the game was very very different from the trailer. Genuinely considering applying my consumer rights and trying to get a refund. Its a sad state of affairs considering I used adore this series. It saddens me. This game shows that the loyal fans who supported it simply aren't considered. This is a game designed for a console rather than a PC. We who supported this series are now forgotten. Things I would suggest that may redeem this.-HD Textures-Improved character models voice acting. Some characters look like they are suffering with an ageing disease.-Expanded stations Give us a more realistic feeling of a large galactic station. Same for docking with ships. Have more happening around the player give a sense of activity.-Re designed Menu's the current ones feel like that are akin to radial menu's on console games.-Optimisation either through Nvidia Experience or Egosoft performing it themselves.-A 3rd person view in the Station sections. While these are unnecessary It could add an interesting avenue for game play. E.g Leading a boarding team to take over an enemy ship or raid a station.,4,I love the X games. But X Rebirth is a huge step backwards compared to the previous titles. It has great potential but is very poorly executed. I hope the developers fix those bug and improve the performance or this was the last X game I ever bought.,0,I feel I have to leave a score of 0 for this game simply due to the number of clearly  10 scores being left. Whether or not this game is riddled with bugs which may or may not be dealt with soon by the devs this game is fundamentally broken. It is really awful anyone who has experience of the X series is in for a big shock with it. The UI has clearly be designed with solely controllersI feel I have to leave a score of 0 for this game simply due to the number of clearly  10 scores being left. Whether or not this game is riddled with bugs which may or may not be dealt with soon by the devs this game is fundamentally broken. It is really awful anyone who has experience of the X series is in for a big shock with it. The UI has clearly be designed with solely controllers in mind it is horrible trying to play this thing with a mouse and keyboard which for a PC title is really bad. They have clearly tried to reach a larger market of console gamers with this and in the process have gimped the controls for the vast majority of their loyal fans. I really wouldn't be surprised to see a console announcement once they have eliminated most of the bugs plaguing the PC release.The price tag of £40 sets this game up as comparable to AAA titles which it most definitely is not in fact it is quite clear from this and the lack of review copies sent out prior to launch that the games release was a cash grab on the part of egosoft. Nobody is going to pay £40 for this game having seen the reactions of those who preordered like myself. The severity of the bugs this game has shipped with is frankly shocking inability to even start the game broken option features such mouse inverting falling through interior maps every five seconds (that is only slightly hyperbolic it took me literally 10 seconds into my first station walk to accidentally get caught on a vent hatch and be pushed through a wall). The minigames are a pain though they are not really that much of an issue compared to my other complaints they just seem cheap. The menus are ripped straight from mass effect (as is the art style for station interiors but that is something else) and is pretty much unusable for k/m players like the majority of X players seem to be. They have apparently made it very difficult for joystick users to though I cannot comment on this.The menus and maps are horrendous to look at and navigate thanks to a combination of  design choice th aforementioned console controls and the constant long animations which kill the flow and speed of the game. While in previous X titles i have been able to set my ship on autopilot for a station or gate and use the instant menus to manage my ships/traders and stations/complexes I am now required to stop my ship and wait for the  menu monitor to appear before I can do anything. The autopilot has also been removed and while the  autopilot was a problem in previous games their solutions seems to have been to remove all autopilot from Rebirth as the vast majority of ships you encounter are moving in strange arbitrary space roads which often lead them into sides of stations (I also feel that it is worth mentioning that these ships are about as real as those encountered in the highways they feel as though they are randomly spawned to give the illusion that you are in a living universe.).That's all I can really think to say about this game for me it is DOA and it seems unlikely that the developers will be prepared to change such fundamental yet broken game mechanics. For these many reasons it is simply unthinkable that this game could deserve a score as high as 8 let alone 10. It is certainly a shame that as a result I must give this game 0 as I cannot allow anyone to be fooled by the average userscore.If anyone has bothered to read this I would give this game an honest score of 3 maybe 4 but that seems to be pushing it a little. I have requested a refund on steam and hope I will receive at least credit on my account and if in the future the developers manage to make this game remotely playable I will certainly buy it again though almost definitely not at the same £40 I (foolishly) paid before release.,1,This game is unfinished and painful to play. I am incredibly gutted I paid £40 for it. I am waiting for a refund under UK's Distance Selling Regulation,2,Okay.  It is buggy.  Bugs can be fixed so if you wait a couple of months you'll be better off than the release day victims.  Fine. Okay  this isn't like one of the other "X" games.  Fine.

It is such a disappointment. First they had a horrible advertising campaign. They had us believe that it would come out in 2012. Then for a year they were completely silent with occasional videos of how they work in GERMAN language. Such a treat for devoted fans. So it was postponed to 2013 and frankly two months ago everyone believed that itI've waited for this game for 3 years. It is such a disappointment. First they had a horrible advertising campaign.

So it was postponed to 2013 and frankly two months ago everyone believed that it would be postponed to 2014 which it really should have because the game in its current state is abysmal. And how ironic  Deep Silver would go out of their way to convince us that they've put all into real life imitation for the maximal immersion and it happened to be the game's capital offense! Immersion my ass. There are literally one single head model per male and female NPCs in the entire game. Half the time I can't even tell them apart. They are all 60-year-old-short-hair grandmas and grandpas. Not to mention the voice-overs. Oh those voice-overs! It's like the actors are literally reading from the script for the fist time in their lives. Same goes for your co-pilot. One person who is supposed to make your journey fun kills it with her robotic voice. I want to find out who the actress is and send her an angry letter.All stations look alike on the inside inside all ships look alike on the outside.... They tried their best make travel more fast and fun but it's all the same. I still have to wait 2-3 minutes while I run by those highways. That actually is pretty realistic now that I think of it. Anyone has to drive to work for 40 min everyday here? Yeah there's your immersion fellas. Bugs. I haven't had too many of those thankfully but I did have a nasty one that pretty much ruined my tutorial part of the campaign because I did exactly as the window script told me to do. Anyone had that crap with the delivery of energy cells? I know for a fact that a lot of people did I checked. And of course there is this stupid  design that blocks 50% of your view thus making one of the most important parts of the game  beautiful view  inaccessible. Why do I need all this crap getting in my way? I want to see the stars. And then again my idiotic co-pilot tells my AI to shut up all the time. What's her problem?.... At least it's a good thing they've allowed modding right of the bat. May be some good people will turn this thing around. But it is not the modders' job to fix a broken game. And there is only so much you can mode. The terrible voice-overs are not going anywhere.,2,I finally registered for Metacritic today just so that I could weigh in on this atrocious launch.  I've been a huge fan of the X series for years.  I've logged over 320 hours in X3TC alone.  I'm running a solid rig  i7 quad core 16 GB ram Nvidia GTX 780. While I haven't encountered the frame rate issues many have I have run into a myriad of others.

I've logged over 320 hours in X3TC alone.  I'm running a solid rig  i7 quad core 16 GB ram Nvidia GTX 780. While I haven't encountered the frame rate issues many have I have run into a myriad of others.  Corrupt save games getting stuck in the clipping when on stations(which is easily the least enjoyable part of the gameplay experience) and buggy missions.  Most recently my ship UI just randomly decided to disappear preventing any further progress on that save as I could not use it to issue commands to my trade ship.  How a game does not have an autosave feature in 2013 continues to baffle me. As many have stated the character animations are atrocious.  Conversation options are drab and feel forced.  Egosoft's attempt to add immersion only serves to break immersion for me.  The copilot(who you're stuck with) drones on with repeated comments that seem to loop every few minutes.  I wish I could seal off my half of the cabin and jettison her out the airlock. The only redeeming factor is that space is gorgeous and flying itself is a joy once you get used to the keyboard commands(which are very similar to the default key commands from x3tc).  Unfortunately the keyboard commands are not mapable(whuuuuut?!) Lack of proper joystick support is also inconceivable to me considering this is a space sim. In it's current state I can only caution potential buyers to keep their wallets put away for now.  With a few months of patches and hopefully a release of the modding tools we may have another great game from Egosoft.  As it stands right now X Rebirth is a steaming pile of dung.,2,After two hours on the PC version I am sorely disappointed. Horrible performance shoddy graphics laughable station "instances" with characters that would seem modest by the standards of a 1998 game. While the space sim seems promising (hard to tell every time I approach a station the framerate goes to hell) the rest of this alpha quality monstrosity is an insult  poor voice actingAfter two hours on the PC version I am sorely disappointed.

While the space sim seems promising (hard to tell every time I approach a station the framerate goes to hell) the rest of this alpha quality monstrosity is an insult  poor voice acting find-the-loot-box mini games and a female sidekick that's cringeworthy even for those who ride the campy retro wave.Six crashes later I'm calling it quits and consider the $50 a late taxation of the endless fun I had with the previous X games.,0,Feels like a beta. The UI is garbage. The sheer number of game breaking bugs is unacceptable. The "Recommended" specs will let you play the game at low resolution on minimum settings which I find to be unacceptable false advertising. I'm just overall extremely disappointed in this game. It feels like it was released a year too early and wasn't tested at all.,2,Bought on Steam can't get a refund. So lets seeThe map system is terrible it makes no sense whatsoever.The  view is the only view I'd rather a seamless view with some HUD elements. At least an option to switch between them would be nice.Mission targets/waypoints sometimes vanish for no reason and you're left not knowing what to do.Docking system is terrible andBought on Steam can't get a refund. So lets see The map system is terrible it makes no sense whatsoever. The  view is the only view I'd rather a seamless view with some HUD elements.

Too much to hope for I guess. All in all I feel cheated and I can not even get a refund. Won't be trusting Egosoft ever ever again sorry their reputation is now ruined.,4,Are these companies all going nuts.  Sim City Rome now this I swear after this year no one will preorder  again.  Before you release a game to us the consumer finish it.   Ok review it is buggy the graphics are poor and I just cant get into it.  Maybe down the road when they clean all this up.  Nothing game breakingly bad just chill and wait till they get this squared away.,2,Buggy and filled with performance issues upon release but that's not really the worst part.

For one if you're going to make stations least do them proper create decent models for npcs and actually give them useful dialogue otherwise you're just creating a terrible feature that does nothing but waste time that could be spent actually playing the game.  Two here's a biggy if you're going to give people capital ships DON'T FORCE THEM TO WATCH IT FROM A FREAKING LITTLE RING IN THE DOCKING BAY.  If you're really can't handle making a generic capital ship bridge interior where we can actually get readouts on what's going on and be able to look out from the bridge instead of a little window with a 45 degree FOV least give us 3rd person view.  Sitting in a tiny little ring in the docking bay with a 45 FOV window with no information on what's going on is pointless. -That being said you can't really use directly control anything else other than the skunk which wouldn't be as bad if it weren't for the aforementioned.-Gone is the intricate single menu where you could control the entire world in it's place are even worse menus that require you to take a 6 sec animation to actually get any useful reading plus founding through even worse menus.-Did I mention for a space sim generally about getting new ships you're stuck in a single ship? Fundamentally the game's broken even asides from the bugs and the performance issues the base game's broken.  Less they actually bother changing that or some mod does the game's essentially unenjoyable if you plan doing more than fly around the galaxy in first person in a single ship.  Only reason you're even getting a 2 is because yes the game does look decent and battles in theory should be enjoyable if it weren't for the fact that they're not.,0,Rated 0. Simply because they released a game they knew were so badly bugged. Just playing the first 20min you come across bugs that the first bug tester would have seen.

Thank god i didn't waste 50€ on this!,4,At their core X games have always been rather difficult games to learn and to master. X Rebirth is EGOSOFTS attempt to create a more friendly experience for new players. While they meet that expectation in some areas they sacrifice much of the immersion from their previous games.For one EGOSOFT did a big space/flight game no-no by focusing more on control-pad based interactions.At their core X games have always been rather difficult games to learn and to master. X Rebirth is EGOSOFTS attempt to create a more friendly experience for new players. While they meet that expectation in some areas they sacrifice much of the immersion from their previous games.For one EGOSOFT did a big space/flight game no-no by focusing more on control-pad based interactions. Navigating the UI feels rather slow and clunky using a keyboard/mouse and joystick setup. Many of the game choices and menus are navigable through XBOX like circular menus. Their settings->controls menu is very unintuitive making it rather difficult to map hot keys.In previous games a simple hot key could get you to any screen you wanted to get to quite easily. In X Rebirth however you must navigate through their circular menus multiple times to get to many of the options.Gone are the days of setting up a ship course and auto piloting to your destination while you keep a sector map up to look out for hostiles. Any menu actions you take from navigating to trading causes your character to swivel in his seat and focus on a small panel to the right.Graphics are a huge improvement over the other games a lot more detail was placed in creating the over world. However when you actually dock at a couple stations you'll find they are just cookie-cutters of each other. Item placement NPCS consoles are all often in the exact same places. NPCs themselves are static they stand in one place like a mannequin. Their dialog is awkward short and choppy and asking them questions will often net you an insult. I would say this is an improvement over other NPCs interactions in the previous games however it is just so.The plot itself is rather uninteresting and your side character is a rather cliche female companion. If you choose the campaign option you are locked into the plot so don't expect to go empire building just yet. Overall the X Rebirth should have just stayed in the womb.Luckily EGOSOFT has a good reputation in continually supporting their games so hopefully we will see some changes. The X modding community is second to none and I expect a lot of improvements to the whole game to come from that community. But as a base game I can only give X-R a 4.,2,I have played for 4 hours now and I like the atmosphere in space in x rebirth.

There is a mission where you have to buy and sell energy cells but your freighter gets stuck due to a bug. This makes the game pretty much unplayable at the moment. Other things i noticed:its really obvious that the game is meant to be played with gamepad (menus dont work well with keyboard)keyboard controls cant be changed at the momentthere are many issues with the voice playback,0,The UI omfg the UI.  I can tell there is a game here but I can't get to it because of the UI.The UI is bad on M/keyboardThe UI is bad on controllerI would probably give it a higher rating if I could get past the crappy UI and actually play it and when I do crash.Did I mention the UI blows?,4,This is for Revolve who has insulted all those who rated the game below 5 (as is my case). I'll start by describing the status of my last X3:TC saved game:200 million credits (2 million credit profit every 5 minutes)Over a hundred factory complexes (over a thousand factories)Over 600 ships.Most plots finished.Maximum rank for all races.So no dear Revolve I'm not stupidThis is for Revolve who has insulted all those who rated the game below 5 (as is my case). I'll start by describing the status of my last X3:TC saved game:200 million credits (2 million credit profit every 5 minutes)Over a hundred factory complexes (over a thousand factories)Over 600 ships.Most plots finished.Maximum rank for all races. So no dear Revolve I'm not stupid or a noob and the savegame above proves I have patience and know my X3:TC pretty well. I find it funny that you delude yourself by thinking that peolple like me are posting biased reviews...I guess your statement  "so please take these idiotic nerdrage reviews as the useless spur of the moment rage induced rubbish that they are and read the 5 to 9 reviews for a more balanced viewpoint."isn't biased at all right? You basically said this: If you fail X:Rebirth here you are some nerdy idiot full of childish rage.LOL I'm amazed that your review is still posted here...Do you know what I don't do? I don't usually reply to comments like yours but I will make an exception this time same as you seem to have done. I won't insult you just because you rated this a 9 you are entitled to your opinion that's the point of this space. I could start trolling you about how could you rate a broken game that high and so on but I won't.I had to restart the campaign 3 times because at some point X:Rebirth decides to get stuck and not to activate the scripts that theoretically make the campaign advance plus savegames become corrupted pretty easily. I don't discard another campaign restart by the way because I think it got stuck again.But that's just me and thousands of others don't worry we are just idiots right?So X:Rebirth runs fine in your rig? Congrats there are plenty of people who aren't so lucky it's not that they are what you called them it's that X:Rebirth has many bugs and it crashes regularly more easily than it should.Are you willing to rate this broken game a 9? Go for it but don't insult me just because I'm not willing to pass a game that I can't play properly because it crashes and gets stuck at some point.I can't use my joystick by the way...ohbut of course as long as I can use keyboard+mouse the game is absolutely great right? The ship panel doesn't respond/disappears too often the interface is limited uncomfortable and it hides commands instead of presenting them in a clear way. Have you tried to trade? I've tried over 20 times during campaign play. When I do the game gets stuck or crashes 80% of the times.An X game that doesn't allow you to trade and you expect me to pass it? Who the hell do you think you are? I really expect extensions will greatly improve UI remote ship/factory management etc. that's my hope otherwise I'll be demanding a refund.Now let's talk about graphics. Exterior graphics are acceptable but not great (most textures are average to low res and polygon count is too low in too many models). Environment models and textures are the best of the game from a visual standpoint and yes Egosoft made this one thing right.Interior and character textures/models however are a crime considering it's 2013...they were good in 2004 but that was long ago.What about  performance? Do you even know what's my rig?Here you go:i7 2600k overclocked to 4.4Ghzgigabyte z68xp-ud4OCZ vector SSD 128gb (alignedoptimized AHCI enabled)16gb ramgtx560ti 1gb I don't know about your rig but mine runs pretty much any demanding game without incidents it freaking flies.Well X:Rebirth runs a little bit below par most of the time but in hazy areas it starts lagging too much and sometimes it suddenly starts lagging for real (around 10 fps or even less) then it's time to relaunch the game. This is clearly some bug within X:Rebirth for I've never experienced this kind of lag with any other demanding game...my rig has seen a lot of those and it always makes me proud. Is everything wrong in X:Rebirth? Thankfully no.-Ambience is in my opinion its top feature. Sector visuals are astonishing.-There is a high level of traffic in almost every sector and you have plenty of stations (station sections)  to scan and explore also in 1st person (although interior graphics are bad and interaction is limited). I'm not sure it comes close to X3:TC/AP scale though.-You can dock with your cap ships. You can watch the cap ship travel/fight from the dock while it gives you a ride to the desired sector. Also now you can target/destroy/hack specific systems of cap ships the same way you could do in the X-Wing sim saga.-While this is not necessarily a good thing SETA has been replaced by powerful boost engines with limited duration. Now it takes much less time to cross a sector. Roads/highways have replaced jumgates in case you like them. Regarless of these positive elements I give it a 4. X:Rebirth has serious bugs that break the game and for now it doesn't deliver as promised.,2,My initial review was a 5. It was mainly due to poor performance/graphics ratio. In any case. the graphics look like they are from 2006 (except space). Space in this game is awesome though and it is probably the only thing that keeps me interested. But here are objective bad parts of the game:1. Why is there only one (maybe two) types of female npcs? Moreover its an old hag with saggyMy initial review was a 5. It was mainly due to poor performance/graphics ratio. In any case. the graphics look like they are from 2006 (except space). Space in this game is awesome though and it is probably the only thing that keeps me interested. But here are objective bad parts of the game:1. Why is there only one (maybe two) types of female npcs? Moreover its an old hag with saggy boobs who is in tights and speaks in a young schoolgirl voice...wtf? Whenever they try to put some glasses or hats on any of the npcs they look crooked and out of place...cmon. Moreover NPCs just stand in stations and ships like statues not doing anything...immersion breaker.2. The stations are all pretty much the same (found 3 varieties one of which is the inside of a ship u dock into). The loot that you might find on the stations is always the same and in the same location. Finding anybody in the station feels like a choir and doesn't add anything towards immersion.3. Poor UI very poor. Kill it with a spade stab it in the brain get rid of it...makes me want to cry.4. Your companion is annoying...her "Shut up Betty" needs to stop. She needs to be vented out of the ship.5. The MAP! Just look at this blinking horrible zone/sector/galaxy...ugh...cant call it a map.6. Bugs. Many of them. I couldn't complete the tutorial when i had to buy and sell some energy cells. At least in X3 AP if NPCs cant do it you can do it for them. Here though you cannot do it any other way but through an NPC and when its bugged....cant complete mission.7. No proper controller support. Warning: (Tears incoming).I want to like this game...i really want to I still cannot believe we all got ripped off so hard. I feel cheated and if i had a chance i would have refunded my game...I would not recommend it to anyone ever and egosoft...I lost all the respect i had for you. Never ever ever i will buy a game from you.(Tears Over).Guys I know i told you to wait for the patches and get it when its on sale...but now I got to say stay away from it entirely. Do not buy it.,4,The game is just lacking compared to the older ones. Theres also a lot of bugs some gamebreaking (e.g. unable to progress with missions).

Sure it's pretty (while in space... the stations are lifeless inhabited by automatons and repeat endlessly) but the rest of the game is clearly dumbed down.  I love hearing people say "streamlined" and "accessible"  and swear it never impacts the depth of gameplay.  It always has and always will.  The game has flown far from it's roots as a space sim as it is clearly designed to use an xbox controller exclusively (to this date I've not found a way to make any of my joysticks: warthog x52 or old- school MS Sidewinder FF2 work with it).  There is no trading you simply have to manually fly to a station then wander about hear some canned dialog click through some menus (again designed for controller) then order another ship you own to do exactly what you already did... since you can only have one ship and apparently it cannot hold anything other than yourself. In summary X-rebirth is to the x-series what the NGE was to Star Wars Galaxies.  In 3 to 5 years the modding community may make it into something playable but I have a gut feeling that most of the bad design decisions (single ship bad UI trading mechanics) are hard coded.  I'd say go ahead and try it when it's in the 5 dollar bin and you have nothing else to play.,1,I SOOOOOOO wanted to like this game...it had so much potential and it could have been EPIC... but EGOSOFT join the Prereleasers Club with members like Creative Assembly with their Rome 2 Firaxis with SimCity and Volition with Saints Row 4....The game is not done... its Beta stage...

I did however appreciate the great depth level of control and complexity of X3's universe surely the selling points of the X brand. I write with 8 hours of gameplay experience so far; I have been very patient with using the functions to see how their usage unfolds. X Rebirth set out with numerous objectives. First and foremost to revitalise the X series with a new modern version of the game that built on the existing success with new graphics better accessibility and general additions and enhancements to the gameplay. Sadly they have failed on all of these counts save two: the game is indeed beautiful and it is more accessible. Alarm bells should no doubt have been ringing when the download size for this game was smaller than Albion Prelude's size alone despite having newer larger art resources for the better graphics... Sadly the price that has apparently been paid for a marginally better campaign and tutorial (and I do mean marginally) is the actual flesh and bones of the X series. Let's start with the most obvious restriction in game functionality: ships and piloting. Its predecessor X3 allowed you to pilot any ship from a small fighter up to a huge naval battlecarrier. In contrast X Rebirth has fallen to new lows  you have one 'special' starter ship and this is all you can and will ever be able to pilot DLC plans notwithstanding. Every other ship you own is limited solely to being given orders over a clunky wheel-menu that seems almost like it was designed for a console controller. There is an 'order queuing' system yes but there is no menu for visualising and controlling the orders of your fleets so it's your best guess from what you've assigned them with your wheel menu. Of course you have a 3D  If only having 1 possible ship is the price that must be paid for a 3D  then I don't personally think it was worth it  particularly as you cannot even free-look around this  (let alone walk around it) outside of the entering-ship animation... This is a double insult to the notion of having a 3D  as not only does it mean it's largely a gimmick but in space combat (and in general) you cannot look in a different direction without turning your entire ship. And you need to because your  art restricts your field of view. On the topic of the  come the menus. Sadly these have achieved something thought previously impossible: they are actually more clunky and harder to use than even X3's menus were. And even if the menus weren't painful to navigate due to the need to use console/gamepad-esque forward and back buttons to navigate they're built into swinging your entire camera around to a pretty but time-wasting 'centre console' in your 3D  which means you cannot quickly check and close the menus or your map (as there is no minimap and no radar anymore...) but rather have to spend what seems like an eternity either way as your ship auto-stops to check your flashy centre console. SETA is gone  and we're told by a developer today that we don't need it due to the built-in magical boost ability (that only your one pilotable ship has) and the new hyperspace highways. This is not the case because guess what  your one pilotable ship has *no cargo capacity* and cannot be upgraded to have any. All trading is performed by separately owned freighters which have to crawl to where you have just tried to directly by goods in order to process the transaction  which means waits of 20 minutes and more regardless of highways  with no time compression. By the way there's no autopilot and the 'highways' function much like the old gates connecting 'zones' which are practically small sectors so you have to actually manually steer your ship changing highways by crossing zones for as many jumps as you need to make to get to your destination. It's quite hard to phrase just what has been lost in terms of ship variety and control and the lack of proper in-game menus to control the potential complexity of the game. In return we've got the ability to get out and 'walk around' in stations and ships  which are as it turns out copy-and-paste clones of each other with identical-looking NPCs sitting or standing in exactly the same room and positions on every station abysmally voice-acted and with no real dialogue. The interior of every freighter and capital ship is equally an identical copy-paste SMALL 'cargo bay'  no fancy corridors or bridges guys. It has to be asked  if they sacrificed so much control and detail to free up resources to make gimmicks like the  and so-called 'interiors' why are these so poor?,1,Played for only 4 Hours Cannot do anything else because of the amount of bugs in this game.

The trailers and hype highlighted the (admittedly) beautiful space scenery and combat while hiding the broken mechanics control system menu layout ridiculous script amateur voice acting and bad indie-game last-gen graphics when docked at a station. Egosoft lead us to believe that we would be getting a first person experience at the level of quality we have come to expect in the series. What we got was a basic and uninspired (freelancer-esque) place where players can wander and explore the same few rooms on every damn station while trying to locate some poorly modeled and textured npc who will either offer to "show us their wares" or (if you ask for the ship dealer  which no longer exists) will simply insult you and end the conversation. This game is a travesty and Egosoft should be ashamed for having made it.

Building galactic empires engaging in huge trades dog fights capital fleet fights. It is all wonderful (and the graphics were good for the time when they came out). I have a Gaming PC which plays BF4 without a hitch but this game kills my system with graphics not on the same tier as BF. Now I can't really say too much about the gameplay as I can't play for long with 20fps but here are my first thoughts:- cool I can walk in stations but it seems more like a chore and it's not very alive. I was hoping for a mass effect atmosphere.- the stations do look awesome and are huge.- The UI stinks. But the UI typically does in all x games. I found it difficult to navigate the maps though and that was one thing which was easy in x3.- Hiring crew is cool.- ONLY ONE SHIP?!?! X has always lured me in by allowing me to try all the different ships have a bunch parked at my HQ and get to have completely different game experiences based on which ship I'm in.- The highway system is stupid. Ill take Seta and jumpdrive thanks. But alas maybe if I could properly enjoy the game without the eyestrain I could understand the dramatic changes in design. I have been waiting years for this game this is the most disappointed about a game release since Dragon Age 2.,2,I had to change my review now that I've played the game a bit more.

Getting killed that early in the game just felt frustrating. I haven't even bothered to start exploring the economics of the game for me this just feels like a complete waste of €50. Stay away at least until they're released some MAJOR patches to fix what feels like an unfinished game.,3,This is a huge disappointment: the game is janked.

to cater for the guys who made the x series so popular they have inadvertently broken the game as a whole. Overall it feels like a console port (and a bad one) of a game that is simply unfinished I would hazard a guess that in the seven years of development they tried to do to much had poor direction and got overtaken technically by out of the box game engines as such they decided to stop development patch it up and release it to try and get some of their money back (or get mod monkeys to do their leg work). I am still trying to work out just what the game is within this sandbox.. will let you know if I find out. Positives:- Crew: More detailed crew stats are a good idea.- Targeting components: Being able to target individual cap ship/station components was something missing from x3.- Component Customisation: Individual station/ship components nice little idea (though not well implemented).- Universe: Lots more going on (possibly a negative).- Accessibility: Improved for the console type player in some ways who will probably enjoy the game until they hit something that was tailored for the strategy gamer. Negatives:- Navigation: Removal of the Autopilot is a dreadful idea.. to dock you have to find the right icon on a huge station (from many icons) and fly close to it then try and click on it (maybe just me but takes 10-20 tries to get the tiny dock menu option to show) to fly to any place you have to manually fly there (even if its 20 sectors away through the one way systems they have implemented) through a series of one way highways (each with its little mini game).- UI: The UI is supposed to be easier but in fact its far worse (at least I could read the options in x3) the game almost pauses you and swivels (away from space view) to a separate deep menu system that is pain to navigate.- Context menu system: Unresponsive menus (with a tiny font.. hell didn't even realise I had a menu open until I stumbled on it) no right click on objects (stations items ships etc) detract from the overall environment.- View: Fixed static  view (with no mouse look) simplified to the level of silly takes up 1/3 of the screen (making seeing and following targets a pain) miserable setting (same through game as you can't change ship) and removal of external view is also a bad idea.- Fleet management: Not happy with the console interface at all.- The ship: A single albeit upgrade-able ship removes a large chunk of the fun I had from the rest of the x series e.g. choosing the right vessel for the job trying new ships piloting capital ships- Map: A key component to any space game (due to the nature of space) is the map this is one feature that you simply can't live without in any space game and in this game its dreadful unreadable and poorly implemented.- Interiors: Interior graphics so bad they are on par if not worse than games from the 10 to 15 years ago (and not joking) dialog options poor layouts mostly the same (no matter what station)...- Mini-games: Why oh why do they even bother even on basic things like travel.- Graphics: Universe looks great but badly optimised (esp in the fog/dust whatever sections).- Characters: Poor voice acting (often repetitive and annoying) static badly animated with no personality.- Combat: Could of been good but is dumbed down to a level of annoying.- Autosave: There isn't one.- Trading: Miss my x3 trading systems.- Controls: Keyboard controls are not customisable and poorly implemented requires a joypad.- Bugs: Game stopping bugs all over the place.- Universe: Lots of smaller systems and lots more ships make the game feel very un-space like.- Highways: Might of worked (it's nice being able to drop out part of the way through) but overall its like a massive spaghetti junction that's easy to get lost in.- Campaign: Poor story-line like a series of tutorials that sometimes tell you to do the wrong thing.- Immersion: Oddly the new stuff for me which should make it more immersive  (interiors removal of right click menu on ships components autopilot removal smaller systems) does the opposite.- Stations: Each one is a great big sprawling mess with multiple components and docking ports due to the nature of being able to target/kill each component there is no real central hub. Way forward:Can't see patches being able to fix fundamental flaws in the game it to much of a halfway house between arcade simulator and strategy. Going to give it a week (of potentially painful game-play). Final thoughts:Utterly disappointed for me they would of been better off tweaking the engine from the X games to add the few new features that are worth a look at. My background in the X series:Old school avid gamer and X universe nut (literally 100's of hours playing X3: AP TC and reunion),1,First off I can understand why the fan boys are giving this release nines and tens they REALLY want to love this game and are willing to overlook a staggering number of bugs and design decisions that are at best questionable. I now have the entire X series from boxed editions to steam releases and have to say this has been the roughest launch I have seen! As previous reviews have statedFirst off I can understand why the fan boys are giving this release nines and tens they REALLY want to love this game and are willing to overlook a staggering number of bugs and design decisions that are at best questionable. I now have the entire X series from boxed editions to steam releases and have to say this has been the roughest launch I have seen! As previous reviews have stated the game seems to have been built for a console as many people cringe at the thought of keyboard shortcuts a game like this needs them. Unfortunately the inevitable side effect of dumbing down controls is to dumb down the game play experience. The complexity may still be there but you cannot efficiently access it while your cycling through button presses and mouse clicks.Graphics don't necessarily make a good game but the frame rate does! I'm currently averaging around 15-20 FPS in open space and 5-10 around stations.  I do realize that my 6850 HD is not cutting edge but it does play a mean game of crysis 2. Npc models almost look liked they were imported from X2 and what the hell is up with that hatchet faced old bitty that shows up on almost every station. She strikes fear in me more than a Xenon Armada!On the topic of mini games I see nothing wrong with them once the frame rate issues are solved trade lane drafting is kinda neat except for the fact that control was laggy and I would over shoot out of the highway. Docking your ship by clicking icons really kicks you out of the immersion on this one I think star citizen has it right idea. These are my some of my many gripes with this game 5000 metacritic characters are not enough to cover it all. Egosoft I think you have released some of the best space games ever but this one is a stinker. Hopefully after a crap ton of polishing and tuning  you can turn this game into another winner!,4,kinda shocking how unfinished the game seemsi got stuck twice in a stationGerman voice act is for ****terrible interfaceno clue how to open the map with the game padbeing locked to the one ship is a annoying,4,Very poor graphics with high system requirements. Awkward control. Often crashes. No exploration. And it just boring.If you like X3 as i am  you will be very disappointed.,2,Base standard for my review... FIX IT FAST!.I've played a lot of buggy games in my time and I didn't think a early release (Actual) would be worse than Sword of the Stars II which was a pretty bad early release those of you who have played and know what I am talking about will get the idea but its worse in X Rebirth a lot of the control systems are buggered no joystick supportBase standard for my review...

(And before anyone tells me otherwise all my graphics drivers are up to date my directX is upto date my Sound is upto Date and yes my C++ Redistributables are current with 2008 2005 effectively as well). I would recommend this game after a stern redevelopment point kinda like what CDProjectks and Kerberus do when they say: Enhanced Edition.

Auto pilot drops you in station hulls where you have to restart or instead of going directly towards a gate takes you on a scenic path that is longer that I have boost for.

You can't destroy stations and can only build in certain spots. The factions just spawn ships so the economy is just for you. Highways suck. I'm constantly muting stupid chatter with NPCs Ren and Yesha like every time you ask for wares or assign a new superior. Mods help but aren't updated so many aren't working now. FPS issues in certain zones so you have to change graphics options back and forth. I spend all my in game time just flying around stations. It's no fun. And all the trading is done in a tiny text window. Come on how about a nice drag and drop or something that doesn't resemble DOS.,2,I have played for about 2 hours now and these are my initial impressions. Game play is clunky and designed for Xbox and PS3 and has been just dumped on the PC making things very problematic if you do not have a controller. Mouse and keyboard are poor second place to a controller.Graphics are for a PC title very poor. Characters are badly animated and have more polygons than youI have played for about 2 hours now and these are my initial impressions. Game play is clunky and designed for Xbox and PS3 and has been just dumped on the PC making things very problematic if you do not have a controller. Mouse and keyboard are poor second place to a controller. Graphics are for a PC title very poor. Characters are badly animated and have more polygons than you would expect given the year. 5 years ago these graphics would be acceptable today not. Space and ships look OK at a distance but close up you can see the lack of textures. Given the poor graphics even with a top of the range PC the performance is poor with numerous random pauses and slow downs. Story line is like something written by a child of 10 and less said about the voice "acting" the better. The opening part of the story is clearly the tutorial which is a great idea. Sadly the guidance on what you need to do is most of the time hard to decipher and at times very unclear. Overall I would honestly like my money back. Was a huge fan of the earlier X titles but this is a poor relation indeed. Paying £10 for this would make the score maybe 6/10 but for the amount of money being charged 2 is a fair score. Stay clear unless you are a huge huge fan of space trading and even then think hard before spending your hard earned cash,2,Unfinished game initially designed and developed for consoles but for some reason they changed their mind somewhere halfway through the development and decided to make a PC game. Literally every aspect of the game is dumbed down or simply cut out from the X3 series. There are a lot of plot-breaking bugs. The interface is terrible and even some extremely basic features are missingUnfinished game initially designed and developed for consoles but for some reason they changed their mind somewhere halfway through the development and decided to make a PC game. Literally every aspect of the game is dumbed down or simply cut out from the X3 series. There are a lot of plot-breaking bugs. The interface is terrible and even some extremely basic features are missing (fleet command being dumbed down to "follow me" command that cannot be even undone). The entire walking in stations part looks as if it was made in 2000 and it's not only ugly but also makes a lot of simple tasks a chore. The two positive things about the game as it stands now are the graphics (as long as you don't leave your ship) and space combat. That is assuming you can actually enjoy this part which is pretty random with the nonexistent optimizations and generally a lot of people reporting 10-20 fps on fairly high end machines (or at least way above what the developers recommended think of i7  GTX780). Generally while the plot-breaking bugs can (and most likely will) be solved I'm afraid that the number of horrible design choices cannot be recovered from in predictable future. X3 fans should really stick with X3TC/AP. It would take years for XR to come anywhere near the complexity of modded X3TC (eg. xTended). In its current state it's hard to recommend this game to anyone at least wait until they fix the plot-breaking bugs and the price drops to $20.,1,Really....REALLLYY!! ....this cant be the game I've been waiting years for.

X was a very hard game to play and took many months to master.  X Rebirth was promised to fix this by creating a X for dummies which intended on adding features like first person on bases and an easier GUI for the player and easier control for your owned assets.insteadTo start this is a title that was intended on bringing new life to the community for which I was a part of since 2003.

I bought this game on Steam based on the 10 years of great community history with the company and overall satisfaction with the previous version.I gave this game 20 hours of wanting to really like it.  It has bugs from factions to graphic issues to crashes with most of the video settings.   Its far short of easy to play even for the season players because they changed everything behind the mechanics of the game.If you like looting on bases and picking u crates and opening lockers then you might like this game.Today on the forums they are asking the community which bugs they should address first.sad fact is all the new players drawing to X by pre-purchasing Rebirth are left unhappy and asking for refunds (of which they will never see).  I deleted my account on their forums and this puts an end to any support I ever had for this company in the 10 years of support they got from me.. including beta testing.I would not buy this product for least a year based on my experience with other X titles.Game over for me Ego..  Sorrry.  You made me look like an idiot recommending this game to my friends and ripped me off 50 bucks for trusting you.,2,The performance of this game is terrible while the graphics are horrible.

Another point of critique is the very bad performance. I have a rather decent pc and even for me the framerate jitters a lot depending on the direction i currently look at. Very annoying in combat. The campaign  as far as i plaid it  is not very good. More like a tutorial coming directly from the developers instead from an story writer. It's mostly really awkward and somehwat childish. But well i didnt buy X for the campaign so forget it. Overall it's still a good X game but by far not the "rebirth" i was hoping for. It mostly seems like the budget was going into make things fancy then really thining things trough and maybe find new approaches. The new approaches they did   like the higway minigames  just don't seem very well-tought. I dunno... i just can't get warm with X: Rebirth. Still a O.K. game.,6,the game is what i wanted so far but the performance are horrible at the present moment less than 30 fps (10 fps in battle) with a gtx 670 which make it painful to play.,7,So far I've been unimpressed by this game.

I have literally counted the days for release and even bought a Nidia 770 so it would play fantastic. It's frame rate is choppy the graphics (excluding space) are average at best the voice acting is sub par the controls (keyboard and mouse) are clunky the in game text is tiny the combat is nothing like the demo is saw it's simply a mess and shouldn't have been released in this state. It needs another six months in development to finish the job. I'm lost for words that it took seven years to reach this standard. Were there only three people on the team? So so sad. As it stands I'm giving XR a 7.  It has the potential to be amazing (and I have no doubt it will be after patching) but the negative feedback is warranted.  People have high expectations and what the Egosoft said they were going to deliver is only 60% there from a performance perspective.  Times are hard and financially the majority of the public can maybe afford one or two games per month.  So when X rebirth doesn't live up to expectation they vent.  We were promised space stations to explore and we have them.  What wasn't stressed is that they are the same station every time with different NPC's on board.  I guess most would overlook this if the frame rate wasn't such an issue. You can tell so much heart and soul has gone into this game and I appreciate programming/coding is difficult.  I can only assume the devs were forced to release in this incomplete state.,5,What is the "elevator pitch" for people to upgrade to this game? How is it an upgrade.

Those of use who loved the supply chain logistics of previous X games will be very upset   this is almost completely nerfed here. One station does it all.Simpler? Yes More enjoyable? Nope  not for me anyway. Combat has been dumbed down. Choices removed. Things like the stock exchange that was present in AP has gone the none campaign missions also seem gone. The graphics while ok are not better than AP either (this is a direct X 9.0c game after all so is running the same technology as the original X3 more or less)I'm not saying this is a bad game just can't see the point of it existing   who did Egosoft make it for? How is it more advanced or better than the last X3 update? I've only put 8 and a half hours in so far but I might as well write this now as I can't see me playing any more. It just seems to lack the depth and rewarding complexity of the last games. I'm looking for "new" or "innovative" and can find nothing... at all. Am I missing something? In short  even when fixed I'm not sure why I would play this in preference to Albion Prelude which is a larger more mature deeper and more rewarding game that looks the same (if not better) plays more smoothly...If anyone could answer that question I'd love to hear from them,7,After 4 hours of playing the game and reading through a lot of comments stating that the game "is in shambles" or "crap"  "worst than Rome 2" I've come to the conclusion that I have to write a first impression review of this game. First of all if you are a veteran of this series and have played several other X games before you may know that it is a little bit different than what youAfter 4 hours of playing the game and reading through a lot of comments stating that the game "is in shambles" or "crap"  "worst than Rome 2" I've come to the conclusion that I have to write a first impression review of this game. First of all if you are a veteran of this series and have played several other X games before you may know that it is a little bit different than what you know. Either new player or veteran you will need to invest time into the game in order to actually enjoy it. Graphics : The "old" parts of the game look gorgeous. The space  ships and  stations are very detailed and it's amazing the world "living and breathing" of its own. The "new" parts like the character models and the insides of the stations look rather disappointing. The textures are clunky and it seems to be a different world. It just does not fit. The new aspects of the game as said above are at the moment like the dark side of the game. You don't really want to set foot on the dark side  enjoy the bright side as long as possible.  6/10 Sound : Same as the graphics. Outside really amazing and inside not really that good up to a point where it gets rather annoying. The music played while flying through the sectors and systems was composed by an orchestra I think a fits really well to the space theme. 8/10 Game-play : The controls for flying the ship and walking around are intuitive and especially the ship controls are very responsive. It's overall really comfortable to fly around with the ship. The combat system is not that different from the previous games of the series. The combat system is fine as it is. The menu controls are terrible. At least for me as someone who played the games before the new "easier" menus are just more confusing and nested. It is really hard to get the necessary information required for the current mission or if you just want to command your transporter to buy some energy cells good luck with that it will take you a while. 7/10 Performance  Bugs : I have ready many complaints about having performance issues (low FPS and crashes)  but I have not encountered any of this mentioned issues. My game runs fine on 60 FPS without any crashes or FPS drops. The same goes for bugs. People are complaining that there is a considerable amount of bugs preventing them to play properly and that the bugs are as major as the bugs in Rome 2 for example. I have not encountered any major bug until now so that's definitely not a point to use against this game. Sadly I can't really write an in depth review  because the game was just released 4 hours ago. This are my first impressions and with the way Egosoft has handled their previous games I'm sure bugs and issues will be fixed in a few weeks so that everyone who bought the game is at least able to play it. Should you buy this game ? Well that's a tough question. I would not recommend buying it yet  but I would also not advise against buying it.  I did pre order the game because I really enjoyed the previous ones. Egosoft also does seem to be a company listens to their community so if you want to support Egosoft  enjoyed X:TC or X:AP I'd and if you are fine with having a not perfect game (atm) then I'd say give it a shot. You could also wait for the price to drop. Overall 7/10 for now. With some fixes and adjustments it could easily get a 9/10  but also with nothing being done it could drop to a 5/10 depending on the progression of the story  the Game-play in the late game.,10,I pre ordered this game and it was disappointing when it had a lot of glitches. The X series has been my favorite since X-Beyond. I knew the old games backwards and the new one was alien. I have since grown to love the game. The developers have been patching / fixing / improving the whole time and it's now a great game.Looking forward to the next installation.,2,This game is not ready to be on the market.

I have invested some 20+hours trying to work around the massive amount of bugs crashes and corrupted save files. Avoid this game at all costs!,2,Ive played all previous X versions. I hoped that x-rebirth is a "rebirth" with better graphics gameplay and so on. But im dissapointed. The whole game is a total mess. Its so badly unfinished its an Alpha not even a beta. There are so many design mistakes and Bugs in this game i cant even discribe how much went wrong.,2,this game is a joke and should have been named  X3: vaselina. its 100 miles way from what the X series was beforeif you're looking for a REAL space sim then just go for one of the previous episodes like X3: TC or AP,0,This came is the Facebook game equivalent of a X game. Dumbed down features graphics ai smallest game world I have seen in X. Save your money donate to the Philippines or give it to a street bum or just save it you will feel much better.,0,The game isn't finished. Every frame in the trailers has been carefully chosen to give a fake impression of the visual appeal. In fact the previous title looks way better then the new one. Once you're actually in-game and looking at the lights smokes decals and highway animations it becomes painfully obvious that they chose nothing short of perfect angles while shooting the trailers.The game isn't finished.

Once you're actually in-game and looking at the lights smokes decals and highway animations it becomes painfully obvious that they chose nothing short of perfect angles while shooting the trailers.Yes I'm a fan and yes I know they'll fix the game in 9-15 months. But it doesn't excuse the fact they they FAKED as much as they could. I won't even mention the absurd number of bugs. They lied and they released an alpha-stage game labeled as a full product. And no you won't agree with this review until you tried the game yourself. It's hard to tell from the trailers.,2,The game is very dumbed down  the other X games where complex and not everyone's cup of tea but this one is overly simplified and riddled with many bugs or features which are simply not working.There are only 4 weapons in the game even privateer had more XD Only good thing I can say is that the graphics in space look good.,1,In short: I great idea horribly executed!! The game is so unfinished that it is unplayable.

Besides the gamebreaking bugs in the campaign you will have to put up with  performance even on a highend pc annoying NPC voices with added bad animations. I found my self saving and loading continously trying to avoid the game breaking bugs in the campaign just to get a little further just because of the possibilities the game offers and the intriguing storyline pushed me forward. But after 9 hours of loading old saves and running into new game breaking bugs I finally gave up. You could hope they will patch up all the issues but there are just so many things wrong with this game it will take forever to make it playable. Everyone who bought this deserves a refund.,2,I know Egosoft has a long history of releasing buggy nigh-unplayable games and then fixing them within months and I'm sure that will happen (to some extent) with X3-Rebirth.

You only have one ship (named  permanently  "The Albion Skunk"...so have fun with that) upgrades and weapons have been slashed to a fraction of X3's automated trading has apparently been removed jumpdrives are (as far as I can tell) gone..the list goes on and on and on. And what did they trade all this stuff for? Nothing. There is nothing better about this game than any of its predecessors (alright some of the visuals are nice  too bad the framerate is terrible even with my very-well-tricked-out machine). I was excited about being able to leave your ship but they didn't even do that right  all you do is wander around identical space stations collecting items (which you're inexplicably allowed to just steal from crates and lockers with impunity) and talking to static badly modeled thoroughly uninteresting NPCs. It's actually more tedious  and certainly more time consuming  than just being able to interact with people via menus ala X3. I really wish I could get my money back (thanks Steam!)  I have honestly never regretted buying a game more. This folks is what you get when you purchase a game sight-unseen! Seriously it was stupid of me  I usually don't buy games without reading several reviews first. The best thing I can say about X-Rebirth: at least it taught me never to make that mistake again.,0,----------------------------------------------Uhh. Just don't. Do not.

They keep saying the same old things and they also look alike! Seems that the developers decided to reuse 4-5 facial skins everywhere! Really annoying. Also did I mention that those 4-5 facial skins they have made are insanely ugly?! I get nightmares just looking at them. Also WHERES THE JOYSTICK SUPPORT?! Cant make a space sim without it! Though they did support one controller the Xbox 360 one. So have fun console gamers!,0,this game is a complete failure. it is one of the few times where i wish i could get my money back. the game runs sluggish even on my GTX680.

They tried to include what I would describe as off the peg console mechanics in a world that doesn’t really support them.   Examples of this is flying around the space station for hours on end finding all the ‘information symbols’ just to earn discounts in an attempt to make the space cities feel exploreable. The copy and paste space stations are forgivable (within reason) but there NPC population is just unforgivable.    They all use the same copy-an-paste conversation systems and the choices become repetitive and annoying after you have met the first one.   It really feels like they missed a trick. At the end of the day this is must buy for die hard X fans but to new comers to the franchise I would stick with X3 and XRM mods. (and I mean DIE HARD!) Give it three months and the majority of the problems will be patched out and the community would have developed sizeable collection of mods to make it good.    Unfortunately that won’t undo the damage of this PR fiasco and shocking launch.,0,Do not buy. It's a scam because Egosft of us just trying to pull money. Egosoft the game was really excited. I am a true fan of the series X but we did not deserve this. Thank you for a wonderful Christmas. For 50 euros I prefer to be able to buy another game from real professionals and not bums such as Egosoft.,1,I do not like the direction Egosoft seems to be going with this game. It feels more like a FPS. It lacks the true depth and learning curve that the previous X games had. I loved the fact that I could buy AND pilot new ships instead of just drones. Its not fun at all to just have one ship granted I liked the Albion Pride design in X3: AP and wanted to capture it for my own but still.

I normally don't make reviews on sites like this and just go about recommending good games to coworkersfellow gamers by word of mouth. However this is a train wreck and as most people will buy this from steam and not be able to recoup their money(NO REFUNDS) I feel and overwhelming NEED to steer people clear of this title and its publishers/design house.

There are so many things that just make this game a horrible experience to play not just for X-veterans. A big part of my experience consisted of walking through copy-pasted levels to find a person that may or may not be there to buy something they may or may not have. Imagining walking through the same level of Super Mario over and over just to see if a certain enemy may spawn and drop a start or mushroom or whatever. That's entertaining by comparison to X: Rebirth. All in all I can not even discribe how disappointed I was of all the things I had hoped for.

The game is just unfinished buggy even unplayable and even so its just WORSE in every aspect than previous. Tip: get X3 Albion Prelude or Terran conflict.

It just plain stinks as a game and as an X franchise game it's a blatant 1 finger salute to the fans. I would have given it a 2 but the CEO's comment 'What an amazing launch it's been!.' has made me realise it's Game Over for X and Egosoft.  I think the CEO put the Ego in Egosoft!,0,This game is dead...X-Tension game in 2000 year will be much better...................................................................................,0,The game is unfinished.

In attempting to make the game more "accessible" Egosoft has taken key features and hidden them away forcing the players to interact with poorly-voiced NPCs using a clunky interface that often as not doesn't work at all. The game was released with game-breaking bugs.  One bug mainly concerning the inability to cancel orders you've given to owned ships caused me to have to edit a save file in order to fix it. Later after hours into gameplay I more or less had to start over because a game-breaking bug corrupted my save preventing me from using any controls or opening any menus at all.  (Except thankfully the escape key which allowed me to quit the game.  I will likely never play it again. Hopefully Egosoft will gain some sort of new fan base with their new "Lowest Common Denominator" approach because they have certainly alienated and lost the fans they had.,0,I created an account on metacritic specifically to write this review.

I believe most of the technical issues will eventually be resolved but there are some serious design issues which really drag this game down. I have long been a fan of the X series and I have been looking forward to this game for months so my experience might be colored somewhat by my disappointment. I have been plagued with poor performance constant game crashes which sometimes require a reboot to get out of and numerous glitches in the trading system and missions that make advancement impossible. Again the technical issues will be resolved via patching. What may not be resolved are the design choices that depart from previous X games. To list:1. You can no longer hop from ship to ship. You can own multiple ships and you can issue them limited orders but your starting ship will be your ending ship and it will be the only one you pilot.2. The trading network has been neutered. You can only issue trade commands for your freighters to sell or purchase goods in their system only. You can't set up the elaborate chains that were possible in X:TC.3. Voice acting: You are chained to another character that has some of the worst voice acting I've heard since Final Fantasy X.4. Menus sub menus sub-sub-menus: You can't just buy a gun or missile while floating in space. You need to dock your ship walk to the individual merchant open a conversation request to see their goods request to see their missiles then request to buy them then tell them how many you want. Seriously restocking missiles is a 5-minute ordeal after every fight. I think I see where they wanted to go with this game. They wanted to make it more appealing to the masses that were previously turned off by the massive learning curve the series holds. Unfortunately instead of streamlining the game mechanics they just hid them behind a poorly-designed and time-consuming interface which is somehow more painful to deal with than the spreadsheets of the older games. I want to like this game so much but there are just too many glaring flaws to get much actual enjoyment.,0,I wish I had read more reviews before buying the game but being a huge X3:TC fan I was not careful enough. The game right now is broken I have had many mission stalling bugs in the first few hours of the tutorial. But I dont expect any game to be bug free at lauch.What is much worst for me is the lack of any auto-pilot or any form of auto trader.

But I dont expect any game to be bug free at lauch. What is much worst for me is the lack of any auto-pilot or any form of auto trader. You seem to have to babysit your trader like a lap dog in this iteration you so end up spending 2 "fun" hours waiting for your trade ship to show up (with no SETA I loved that feature...) if he ever does. I have had a very hard time with the interface (something I have never had with X3) its hard to know what your ships are doing or even where they are. The map is utter non-sense you cant get any usefull information out of it. The highway is buggy as hell and just pure crap turning the act of space navigation into a mini-game. But for me the absolute WORST is that you are forced into some kind of space scavenger or garbage man role going from station to station to pick up free crap scattered in boxes... that is just not what I call fun specially in what I expected to be a complexe space simulator. For me the X serie is now broken. A lot of user say it will be fixed by patches but I do not think thi sis feasable. I think Egosoft has messed up big time trying to simplify the game and port it to Xbox this and many other weird design choices (Only one ship?!?! in a space simulator really?!?!?!) have made this the piece of crap it is. I have never been so dissapointed after purchasing a game (and the price tag was 50$ too...),0,Most bugged game ever played by me every patch restore something and broke something other. Now it's not playable at all (no trade  ships are frozen even if i started game once again and again),0,This game isn't ready for release. This is not XIt's a total disappointment. All features that make X Universe solid are cut out or oversimplified. When X3TC was true sandbox where you could do whatever you want whenever you want this is just scripted rail-straight stuff just like singleplayer campaign in CoD.Horrible optimization and bunch of bugs. Needs some serious patching.,4,What can I say.... I am really disappointed in this game. :(Graphics are bad the animations are bad textures are made in a hurry or something because any beginner photoshop user could make textures like those or even better and the saddest part is that I am not kidding.Performance at the moment is terrible. I got like average 30 fps on med-high end PC.The story seems to be garbage.What can I say....

Voice acting is not that great.I have not found anything positive worth mentioning,3,As I am about 15 hours into the game I am now able to give a short review about it.It is playable if you have a powerful gaming computer and as there are very few graphic options in the menu you won't be able to adjust performance according to your hardware as freely as pc games would normally allow you.

Not to mention the serious optimization issues and frequent framerate drops that occur even if you run it on an high end pc. It has a fairly impressive sound options menu though.Controls are smooth and mostly intuitive but compared to previous X titles it seems way to 'consoly' in my opinion even though they are still too clunky for me playing with a controller. Mouse and keyboard are working good but players with multibutton gaming mouses won't be able to take full advantage of their hardware as mouse controls aren't rebindable.Even in the current build 1.14 the game still suffers from frequent crashes and as it has no autosave you'll find yourself constantly mashing the quicksave button. With the mere technical apsect covered only story and gameplay remain.As for the story it is fairly engaging. Nothing too special at least during the first few hours but definitely more immersive as most previous X Games. The fact that you only have direct control over one single ship this time somewhat limits your gameplay experience but helps identifying yourself with your ship and the protagonist on the other hand. I cant say that this i generally a bad design decision it's just different. In fact the game is full of interesting ideas. The new Trade System is innovative but navigating and "finding" offers and sales can get really tedious. It seems like searching for collectables sometimes which artificially lengthens the game in a very annoying way.The Highways are a great idea as well but as poorly designed as the trade system to a grade it becomes simply illogical. Why am I moving faster if I put myself behind other ships on a lane? How do they build up speed in the first place because they don't seem to be bound to the same rule as me. It's ridiciously stupid simply said. And now my major bugbear: the campaign bugged out. At some point you have to deliver a number of food provisions to a station but the game took away my cargo ship or "forgot" to give it back to me when it was supposed to do. And as your only way to trade goods with exception of a small selection is to ship it with large freighters (as far as I know  the game does a terrible job at telling you things) I find myself completely unable to progress.There are some other minor and major bugs: ships disappearing from your Properties-Screen even though you can still see them on the map and even give them orders. trade commands that won't be executed correctly. The aiming assistance is irritating at best  so far I haven't found out where to put my cursor if the target moves.. which most of them targets do.. naturally. It's definitly not where the game suggests me to put it. The list goes on and on and on. All things considered I believe I had about 6 hours of fun and 9 hours of frustration which leads me to my final conclusion:Do! not! buy! this! game! in it's current state. It has massive potential given enough time to be polished. As it is now it's great ideas and innovations are plagued by bad conversion and legions of bugs. 3/10 (2/10 if I weren't  a fan of the X-Universe),3,The graphics are gorgeous and i like the IDEA of playing with a controller. But these already are the good points. The main game itself is nearly unplayable at the current state and is NOT worth the 50€!,3,10 hours in and it has been an awful experience.Out of the 10 hours I've been playing I've spent 70% of the time working around bugs and fiddling around the abyssmal joke of a console ported ui.Graphics are ok but this does not give you anything if the game just doesn't work.In my opinion the bugs are patchable but not the failure they call "game design".Let's see what you get10 hours in and it has been an awful experience.Out of the 10 hours I've been playing I've spent 70% of the time working around bugs and fiddling around the abyssmal joke of a console ported ui.Graphics are ok but this does not give you anything if the game just doesn't work.In my opinion the bugs are patchable but not the failure they call "game design". Let's see what you get for your 50 bucks:Abyssmal UI that makes you want to bite into your keyboard?

Check! And to be honest who thought it was a good idea to have the player dock every time he want's to use a station's service needs to get fired. I have waited a long time for this game and after all they've promised us it's been an utter disappointment.,3,The engine has been poorly optimized and fps are unchanged across all settings and resolutions.

Rebirth really shouldn't be considered an 'X' game. If Rebirth had been a new independent franchise looking for a home on consoles it would be a mediocre game at best (that's why I gave it a 3). But by slapping the letter 'X' on the box Deep Silver has essentially suckered its fanbase in buying a bad game. IBugs aside    this review is based off the gameplay and design choices alone.

I have a hard time believing this game was initially designed to be an 'X' game in the first place. I feel like Rebirth was being designed for a different purpose and only later did it become Egosoft's problem. I look forward to a few years from now when this whole thing is forgotten about and a proper X4 is delivered to us.,4,Originally I was going to write a lengthy review but the best I can do without rambling is to give you 2 bullet-points and then summarize. 1.

They seem to be designed for a console experience but the game requires much more than what the control settings suggest and besides this is a PC exclusive. Why is this even a problem? 2. The UI is non-existent. None of the  monitors have any necessary UI. How are you supposed to have a detailed space game without a comprehensive and intuitive UI? Well Egosoft don't seem to know the answer either. So to summarize those 2 bullet-points:  design.I'm guessing they wanted to make the game a bit friendlier to newcomers which is a novel concept.In fact I hate how un-friendly space games usually are so this could have been my favorite of the whole genre.Of course they f***ed up. So yeah It's a VERY confused game. BIG disappointment.But I still have faith. I think they can retaliate with a massive patch. Or at the very least with mods.Thankfully there are several indie projects going on that might do a better job.,3,Game LOOKS good but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. The problem with this game lies in the performance that most players (me included) have. Decent systems that give 45FPS or more in other games give only 15FPS in X Rebirth. And it's just that why I give this game a 3  the performance is so low that it's UNPLAYABLE. On the good side though EGOsoft is busyGame LOOKS good but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it.

And it's just that why I give this game a 3  the performance is so low that it's UNPLAYABLE. On the good side though EGOsoft is busy patching they did  find the bug causing most of the performance issues (my bet it's mostly architecture of older Intel and all AMD CPUs). But a week down the road and a daily patch (yes a new patch every day  EGOsoft does really work on it!) still didn't give the performance every other game gives. So for now a 3. Perhaps I'll re-review it when the performance bug has been squashed and I can actually comment on the game itself,3,After I bought "Schicksalsklinge HD" in summer I thought there will never be a game again that is that much flawed bugged and unfinished at the time of release.Here I stand corrected.This wasn´t even a feature-completed Alpha when shipped and it will take at least one more year of heavy patching to finish it. Sadly I don´t believe it will live up to the expectations even when it´s done.,4,Never played any X games did not check the news and I like the genre (loved Freelancer) so there is no "fanboy" factor in my opinion.Graphics are unoptimised my rather good computer has constant 10fps near busy space stations no matter if I set the graphics to minimum.

You can talk to and hire a lot of different characters... but a lot of them have the same voice and lines (oh jeez I wanna kill the copilot who says always the same thing when you're docking). Welcome to X Rebarf.,3,Days after "release" and nothing has been fixed/added.  By the developers own admission this game is unfinished.  Shame on them for passing it off as finished on the Store Page.  And shame on Valve for allowing them to do so.  Very unethical and illegal in certain parts of the world.,3,Gameplay Time: 2 days 15 hoursVersion: 1.12-1.16Last played: 25-Nov-13This game is both amazing and a complete disaster at the same time if you're fortunate enough to have the game run at a decent FPS it's an incredibly beautiful scene filled with an amazing buzz of life lights and sounds.

If you're like the other 90% of us well tough you get your 20fps and you live with it sadly. The gameplay itself feels like a Beta the game is not nearly finished the main story line has been for me more about bug fixing then actual gameplay. Using the save files as workarounds for a lot of the current bugs I find myself spending more time on Google looking for answers then I do in game sadly with the amount of replies I find I doubt im the only one facing the same issue. At every angle this game feels like something a university student would have made the night before it's thrown together with bits that have been copy/paste-ed from around the universe within the game all the station internals are identical the character animations are bugged and very robotic the UI is rubbish and a complete disaster to use most of the container graphics i swear have been copied from Borderlands 2 the drone system is slow and broken and worst of all you can never ever ever fly another ship...There is no doubt this game needs a lot more work and the premature release may in fact see what could have been a great game simply pushed into the "DO NOT WANT" heap. Well what about getting around you ask exploration has been a massive feature in the X series and has always been a lot of fun well may as well get on with it; the highway system is frankly rubbish and buggy often ending up inside other ships that you're supposed to "slipstream" behind graphics rendering of objects at a distance is horrendous lighting and shaders of other ship models at Medium-High settings are straight out of the 90's and to add insult to injury; trade is completely broken not being able to control the actual ships doing the trades is incredibly frustrating as you watch them do nothing with your orders. So you may ask at this point; why buy it at all then? Well luckily there is a ray of light in this seemingly bleak and gloomy world the game is a spectacular piece of action art story and euphoria when it works when it all comes together after hours of troubleshooting you get that glimmer of what this game could really be as you're instantly re-immersed into the game's world with amazingly easy to use combat mechanics beautiful visual effects and a backdrop that will render you awe struck the game really does deliver on the core stuff...eventually. The sad fact is its all there everything that EGOSOFT need to make an amazing game but sadly they've come up short.,3,I played this game for a few hours until I got to a quest that seemed to be broken.

The game is pretty and there is some potential I guess but honestly crashes and this bug prevented me from getting far enough into the game to give an educated review about anything else. The game is simply broken.,1,Just going to put ^ for all the complaints and then some for the about this atrocity. In fact the total makeup of this game reminds me of Ubisoft churning out rubbish linear monotonus game-play games one after another and even then it didn't go all to  "Better" graphics all go to waste in the absence of optimization with a high end cpu i get choppy graphics.

Last two releases were wonderful minus the terrible polygonal faces and lip movment. There is a major improvement in the humanoid department maybe from virtua fighter days to 2000 (Current year is 2013 for the record). For heavens sake  get someone who can actually make humanoids look like humanoids. Only thing i didn't experience from most of the other users crashing.It's going to take a miracle to "fix" this game.Better start from scratch or just reuse the previous X-series formats would still buy those. By the least i can CHOOSE a ship i want to use. 1 point for the interior design of the Albion skunk. That's being generous. I'll only continue to support egosoft because of their history of good games and that this is a giant leap from the predescessors level of game design.,1,Tried really hard to get into this game and was terribly dissapointed.

I have some small hope that when the bugs are fixed and user feedback is addressed it will become an OK game but probably never a great one.  It feels like a failed console game ported to PC with chewing gum and twine.  It never should have been released in this condition and I hope Egosoft realizes the enormous harm this has on their reputation isn't worth the little bit of money they made.  If you want a good experience in this genre try playing X3 wait for Star Citizen (which will hopefully be good) or even go all the way back to Freelancer.  As old as Freelancer is now it is a much better game.,1,There is a very good reason this has a bad rating it's because its BAD I pre ordered this junk and sorely wish I hadn't numerous bugs glitches a boring campaign ridiculous system requirements for it to run well a boring and stupid story and bad controls make it a chore to play not fun at all and i would rather be working than playing this junk.

I guess I'll cover the things that CAN'T be fixed with a patch. - The space stations are really really samey. Like I think that there are three station maps total for the hundreds of ingame stations. Should have been procedurally generated or cut entirely.  I think the idea of disembarking your ship to do station/planet missions is a brilliant idea for a space sim but this is truly terrible execution. Going on the SAME stations every twenty minutes to do basic maintenance and resupply is grindy and terrible. Also enjoy the "where the hell is the vendor type I want" mambo. - They claim to have made the interface easier but have made so many confusing unexplained oversights that I can't call the interface anything but regressive. If there hadn't been a mission to guide you exactly through freighter trading I never would have figured it out. And I still don't know if there's even an inventory screen for the items you pick up while wandering around stations. - The station design is truly baffling. Was it really necessary to have six docking points on the same station each with a different array of vendors? How about one docking point with a menu of items for sale with the option not the necessity of leaving your ship? I find it hard to believe that an advanced spacefaring culture doesn't have online storefronts. - Finding and equipping weapons in X was always a huge pain but they've gone and oversimplified it the other way. I really don't mind stock layout in paid 'tiers' of upgrades for the ships I'm never gonna fly but really five weapons for the main ship? The sound is gorgeous the universe feels a lot more colourful diverse and expansive and the ship models are attractive but that is not enough to save this game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone and it really bothers me because I know one truly bad game can sink a company and a franchise. So everyone go buy X3. Much better game and maybe it'll convince Egosoft to take smaller less ambitious steps in the future.,1,Don't buy this game I watched the pre-release videos claiming that the game would be easier to use it is not.

After the 1.19 update I thought I would give it another go but have been stressed and frustrated for 30 minutes and cannot take anymore I have never reviewed a game before but I am so annoyed that I have for this game just to make sure players are warned about it. Why when you have a small studio such as this with a relatively active community did egosoft not release this as a cheap alpha and get feedback and bug finding for free if they paid there testers then i would ask for your money back. There are 2 good new things the highways and the being able to target individual items on large ships and stations and thats it.,1,I have played x2/x3 countless hours I played this game for around 40 hours and I was thinking its an interesting beta except its not.Visually its nice 8/10controls for flight solid 7/10drones kinda a cool new way to use them 6/10 until your ship is destroyed because your in a dronelack of everything elseuser interface controls for commands for ships 0/10 there are really noneI have played x2/x3 countless hours I played this game for around 40 hours and I was thinking its an interesting beta except its not.Visually its nice 8/10controls for flight solid 7/10drones kinda a cool new way to use them 6/10 until your ship is destroyed because your in a drone lack of everything elseuser interface controls for commands for ships 0/10 there are really none and the one thats there only half works add to squad however remove from squad and they still follow you and tell you there do not have fuel and still follow you glitchymissions 2/10 glitchy at best the pay and the difficulty have no bearing on anything there is no real briefing of what to doweapons 5 weapons total  with no upgrade ability 1/10number of ships i can fly 1... 0/10how many times did i lose all controls and have to restart in 40 hours about 8 GLITCHY 0/10how many times did the game crash for no reason in 40 hours  5  0/10 UNSTABLEoh my combat targeting issues 0/10 for targeting why you lock a target and then all ships blink and all locks gone and theres no hot key to lock targets or cycle them and with all them as red triangles whos closest?and killing drones and losing standing with everyone around even groups that hate the owner of said dead drones. 0/10but a show stopper is the stations it was removed after x2 because it slows the game down and players lose interest try looking for a single dealer selling 1 upgrade item in a random system random station on a random floor no maps and 10 other people selling things that are close but not the right one big upset there 0/10As a hard core X player if i remember i have this in 1-3 years i might try to update it and play it again and probably mod the heck out of itOverallno choices slow play glitchy crashy non x style game.DO NOT BUY IT YET SAVE YOUR MONEY TILL LATER1/10 overall due to cool graphics,4,What should have been a revolution turned into a devolution. Egosoft promises of a living world that moves and changes with you still remain promises under a million of bugs. The game has received a lot of patches and will receive a lot more but I fear this will not fix the bad design decisions already made.,1,The worst game for FPS every graphic setting turned off and still runs like a dog.

The graphics are decent. You can trade stuff between zones to make money. You use highways and gates and it takes time to get around which makes the universe feel big. But you can't trade cause your freighter won't follow orders and your computer only remembers available trades for an hour. There are some important orders for crew and captains that just plain aren't there (like hold position or goto zone X without  me). Some main plot missions can't be finished without editing your save file manually and the game occasionally hangs or crashes straight to the desktop. The combat is probably the best part. Fly around like in freelancer and shoot stuff. But boarding capital ships is pretty broken. Often your marines will all die while you're following the instructions perfectly with no explanation. Bottom line: this game has the potential to be great but it needs another year of quality development time before it'll be worth the money.,2,This game is a nice shoot 'em up or a nice arcade game you know with sticks and buttons and everything. If you are looking for a game in which you can pilot a giant spaceship with all those functions technical gibberish and stuff you have to try another game.  The space simulator you are looking for is at another castle. Nice graphics though but I think that's it.,4,I'm not an X series fan.

Why they add this piece of ugliness in such a beautiful game? For what reason? And it would be ok if station walks were optional. But you have to dock to station to find job applicant or items trader. I guess in X Rebirth universe they forgot what internet is. Station walks is number one that makes this game bad. Looting the lockers? Is it a bad joke? I have my own spaceship and I need to run the station and crawl the vents to steal some credits or a space suit? Talking with people? Hmm that makes sense. Until they repeat the same dialogue ten times.The second thing that kills the game is it's console origin. Every second you will realize that it's a badly ported console game. Controls menus interface everything is for gamepad not keyboard. I have more than a hundred keys and I still need to go to menu to switch HUD mode. And no free look. Of course how can you implement free look on a gamepad? So you sit in your chair with lots of controls and screens in your spaceship and you can only look in front of you.Anyways the game is fun if you will never visit stations. But you can't.I still think they can improve the game. If they only make station walks optional and make separate interface for console and PC versions the game will become playable and rather fun. Even with other minor issues like primitive combat or lack of interaction options with NPCs. I hope they make station walks optional and remake the interface. But I doubt they will. But until then it's a waste of money. Don't buy it.,4,Where to start with this game. Is it broken? Yes. Does it feel unfinished? Mostly certainly. Does it have problems? Without a doubt. Is it worth buying in it's current state? No. But that's not to say that it doesn't have it's good points. It doesn't currently have many the one's it does are buried under layers of poor design choices and if not game-breaking bugsWhere to start with this game. Is it broken? Yes. Does it feel unfinished? Mostly certainly. Does it have problems? Without a doubt. Is it worth buying in it's current state? No. But that's not to say that it doesn't have it's good points. It doesn't currently have many the one's it does are buried under layers of poor design choices and if not game-breaking bugs having-to-find-a-way-to-make-this-work ones. As mentioned in most other reviews the ability to walk around space stations is a novel idea it's just horribly implemented here. The NPCs are ugly the corridors are repetitive the general thievery allowed is baffling and the textures are low-res. Outside the stations the vista's are much improved if not a bit cluttered. This is space where no-one allowed for the fact that space is HUGE by shoving everything into a tiny area and linking things by gaudy highways. Despite only using DX9 the environments can be strikingly beautiful when the textures aren't tearing. And travelling between sectors is fun the highway mini-game is a nice idea again an idea that doesn't quite work because your beautiful view is taken up with a badly textures ship in front sometimes that you are half-way clipped into. Combat is fun if not extremely hampered by the massive restriction in POV no way to lock onto nearest targets and lack of radar. Yes it's a space game. With no radar. Another baffling design choice. Also when being attacked outside of space stations your are punished for self defense as if you were the original aggressor. Frustrating! Trade is. Well I'll let you know if I can get it to work. Currently I'm hampered by the fact that my ships keep disappearing from my owned ships list. It's hard to trade when you are lacking a means to do so. Egosoft seem to be patching things up at a nice pace even if the patches don't seem to be addressing in my mind the biggest flaws in the game. It's currently a 4 in my book has the potential to improve. But it has a long long gaudy yellow highway ahead of it.,3,dis-regarding bugs witch can be fixed there are "issues" with this game that's supposedly a space SIMULATORno radarNo freelookNo targeting commandsPoor JStick/HOTAS supportno effective wingaman commandsNo effective fleet commandsMost ships are placeholders flying in one big infinite loop interacting with nothing.No true player ship customizationNo true dynamicdis-regarding bugs witch can be fixed there are "issues" with this game that's supposedly a space SIMULATORno radarNo freelookNo targeting commandsPoor JStick/HOTAS supportno effective wingaman commandsNo effective fleet commandsMost ships are placeholders flying in one big infinite loop interacting with nothing.No true player ship customizationNo true dynamic economy(contrary to what is stated in PR pieces) If your looking for a space sim or an X-game look elsewhere it aint here,1,I have put 49 hours into this game.

You can argue and fuss all you want about the game but its mini game hell strung together with a pretty background and some interesting sounds and music. But even that doesn't help its buggy sure but that is not the problem They tried to make the game more engaging but they devastated it by adding way way too many features that shouldn't have been in there in the first place. Let me explain as an avid X3 fan I enjoyed the space sim sure it was a bit hard to get the hang of and fighting in that game was ridiculously hard and pointless but i played it for the trading and what not anyway. This game feels like it is trying to follow Freelancer but failed because it tried to toss in a Mario party level of mini games that were mostly broken. Sure running around in stations sounds fun until you realise you have to do it for just about everything from upgrading your ship to buying drones and repairing your other ships you have to put ships into your personal wing in order to do anything. thats right every ship you own goes into your wing and follows you around the universe as you explore fight and trade the mini game for finding wrecks are more profitable than large scale trading as the goods you find are generally worth way way more and only take a few min to hunt down a couple million worth. The game is rough for a finished game and that doesn't bother me as thats what they do now days take your money give you a busted product and fix it over the next 6 months in most cases and i suspect thats what is going to happen here with X:R  they are working on it and it has received tons of patches but honestly the game needs more work than patches as its horribly designed with the mini games and combat taking the foreground to anything else in the game when it was released combat was the only thing that actually worked well and I like it they brought back the freelancer feel with the games combat mechanics the ships even behave mostly the same so its not overly challenging for me as a vet of freelancer not like the combat system in x3 anyway. I was optimistic that the stupid design decisions wouldn't get in the way of the game when i was waiting eagerly for it and sadly they did from the beginning i found the mini games pretty annoying if i wanted to play a game full of mini games id dig out my wii and play Mario party. I tried really really hard to like this game and i do somewhat for some of the things it got right like combat and pretty space backgrounds with decent sound and music to accompany it. but sadly i don't like it enough to continue to play it even if the game gets patched to the more stable state that its working towards.,4,Well I personally have been massively disappointed with this game. I can accept that they wanted to make the game a little more action orientated and that they thought streamlining it would make the game playable to more users but I can't accept the end product.I have played for 60 hours free play I stopped campaign after about 2 hours of play due to bugs and the storyline is boringWell I personally have been massively disappointed with this game. I can accept that they wanted to make the game a little more action orientated and that they thought streamlining it would make the game playable to more users but I can't accept the end product.I have played for 60 hours free play I stopped campaign after about 2 hours of play due to bugs and the storyline is boring and uninspiring. In those 60 hours I tried to establish a trade empire just as I used to in the other X games and build up a fleet. The trading is tedious having to constantly fly around looking for offers that expire after an hour or so and need to be done again. The money earned from trading is insignificant to boarding and selling captured ships even long range scanning earns you more money than trading does so whats the point in it?Fleets are useless with no offensive commands or navigational orders. The ships just follow you along through enemy sectors getting blow up by fighters.Boarding has been made easier to the point that is no challenge. There is not an enemy in the game that makes me afraid not one. Boarding used to be about careful planning and detail gathering ships together massing the ships at as et point and then executing your boarding. It was hard it was dangerous but it was fantastic when you pulled off a good one. I don't get any feeling of satisfaction from boarding in Rebirth its mindlessly simplistic.The UI is horrific even with a 360 pad with multiple layers in radial menus. They said they made it this way because the old UI was bad it was a hundred times better than what it is in this game it couldnt have been done any worse.Station interiors. Well the idea sounds good and done right it could be amazing. What we ended up with was a load of cut and paste nasty looking station interiors populated by static NPC's that look like they come from the PS1. Conversation mini games crawling through air ducts to open red boxes pointlessly silly things that simply do not belong in a space sim.Space. Well its pretty enough its not amazing but it is certainly good. The stations look good. Combat seems great at first more like an ace combat style. Soon though it becomes apparent that your never going to have to face that many enemies at once just small groups mostly single fighters spaced far apart. They also are very easy and you kill them with no harm to yourself. Not having any control over targeting is bad too as you frequently lose the lock on the target you want and often then lose track of it completely. If you attacked from anywhere other than directly in front of you you'll never know its coming until you are hit.The skunk. One ship need not be that bad if done properly with a large array of upgrades and weapons to choose from it can be very good actually. Yet we ended up with hardly none of that. The choice of upgrades and weapons is pathetic. The  is welcome back but in doing so all other views have been dumped and you can only look straight ahead which kills the immersion and makes awareness impossible you dont even know whats behind you. Of course I have to mention the "copilot" whose only piloting abilities are to dock the ship. Mindless lines of drivel spouting out of her mouth an irritating and pointless distraction.Exploration is made all that much harder with the new map that is very difficult to read and is not interactive not even allowing you to select a target which in busy systems is sorely missed as finding some ships can be a nightmare.There are those that say in months to come it will be better and a lot of bugs ironed out and improvements made. However I'm reviewing the game today not in the future and today I think its worth no more than 4/10.,1,Graphics are shockingly poor ships and stations are all one copy-pasted location the NPC characters are hideous (see Gamespot review for piccies) and the game is STILL impossible to complete in a legitimate way despite 20 patches to date.  Fought for a refund from Steam for this one.  Avoid. 1 point for the ship vistas in space.,1,Awful game where even the game engine is half made and broken. The UI is horrible graphics is 10 years behind average and game is full of bugs. I WAS a huge fan of X-series and I have all the previous games from X-BTF.

But they are nice to look at. I don't really care for the interior graphics because for one thing  this is a space simulation. I really don't mind that the models look stiff and are basically just copy/pasted versions of one another. The thing that annoys me is that you aren't able to call them while being in space. This is really tedious. But for the graphical part i have not too much negative to say. One ship only policy:Granted after having the immense freedom of virtually piloting/commanding every damn ship you saw in X2 and X3 is a major set back. But the series started as a one-ship only show and thus i wasn't too sad when they announced that we're back to one ship which you can customize heavily. The issue i have here is that this ship is literaly a piece of junk. It looks bad and i feel like buying a sportsbra as soon as i enter that ship. You cannot really change any major structures on your ship except make it look "whole" again. The drones are a nice gimmick but thats all. I dont want to have the illusion of being able to pilot multiple vessels when all i can do is fly those little buggers around my big pile of space-trash called "Albion Skunk" ...even the name is bad. I'm just extremely disappointed in the way the designed that ship i can't get over it. They announced it with such a big enthusiasm and "how immersive" it is. Yet all you can do is push one damn button to get onto the bridge (note: the button didn't even work every time i used it). Controls:X1  X3 had some great ways of using your joystick. Assigning keys making your own settings and saving them under different names for every situation a perfect setup. That was perfect. When i wanted to play X3TC on my laptop and didn't have my joystick around i just switched the settings with a few clicks to play via mouse and keyboard. No such thing here as you can't even get most of the mainstream joysticks to even accept your keybindings. Hell i have this generic microsoft "X-Box" gamepad for my computer and can't even bind the missile-launch key to any of the buttons on my controller. Before i end up rambling i just want to say this: Yes i had low expectations for this game. I was assuming that it was bugged to a big extent (which has to be expected by an Egosoft game). I assumed that controls and the universe itself may be a bit clunky and not really well programmed. But you know i was thinking that aside all these things it's still playable and enjoyable. But it is not. This has been so far below my already bottom dwelling expecations that i'm completely baffled. Now i'm no programmer but what in the name of Nathan R. Gunne did they do in the last 7 years? To be frank: I don't give a rats ass about the story i play this game to imagine being the ruler of my own sectors. Crush anyone in my path after raising a gigantic empire. Build secret bases undermine other species. Or just trade or being a pirate or a damn space-truck driver. This is supposed to be MY universe where i can do whatever i want. Now i'm totally restricted left with a lot less freedom. Now don't get me wrong i do believe that they will deliver a fair amount of patches and do a lot to improve it. But to be honest i paid 45€ so i could play the game on 15th of November the release day. Not sometime in January or even later when the game itself is on steam sale for 30 bucks or something like that. They should have done an early access sale if they were on the brink of running out of fundings. But selling a full price game that doesn't even live up the lowest of expectations is an outrage. I do really hope Egosoft is improving this broken game asap. I mean they should because the amount of money they made out of the first three days is huge. Top sales on steam thats juicy. So what i reckon? Don't buy the game now wait a couple of months and don't waste your money on a broken unfinished full price game. ps: Remember that scene right in the beginning where your lovely co-pilot Yisha almost suffocated because of the damage to her ship and threw her helmet into your ship? The one thing that made me actually chuckle was the fact that even though she had a helmet her chest was completely unprotected from the vacuum.,0,I have played ALL previous X titles and I loved them. I love the open universe where you CAN fly anywhere thought at great risk and you CAN do everything even if it has consequences. This pathrtic thing though..This Alpha release...This refuse from Egosoft. It voids all previous work done by them. There is Egosoft pre X-Rebirth and there is post X-Rebirth. Post X-Rebirth andI have played ALL previous X titles and I loved them.

It voids all previous work done by them. There is Egosoft pre X-Rebirth and there is post X-Rebirth. Post X-Rebirth and Egosoft have placed themself in the dubious category of firms that sell a title on nothing more than the success of its predecessors. Egosoft have gone Diablo 3 with X-Rebirth only much much worse. The good: The detail in space is fantastic. Space never looked so good. (Thats it. There really isn't anything else to say). The bad: These details are pointless as the game bugs down to a 5 FPS slugfest on even the best of machines. The FPS lag fest will also have you clawing at your face as you try to hit infinitely small docking ports....Twice or perform any of the other myriad of necessary tasks. When you manage to dock you enter a spacestation 1 of 3 take your pick that is beyond ugly. Some compare it to Halflife 2. I'm not that generous. Deus Ex 1 and you get the picture. The right angle tunnels are as ugly as a Trabant. The only thing more hideous than the spacestations is its inhabitants. They are positively vile. The "animation" and I use this term VERY loosely of these androgynic clones is so bad that they make Scooby Doo season 1-4 look like Toy Story. Then these misfits open their mouthes and you just wish they hadn't because the "voice acting" again a broad generalisation on my part is abysmal. They have 10 lines to greet you 10 lines to say goodbye and they're ALL complete crap. A dog barking would be an improvement. Or a howler monkey. Then there's the menu's. Ohhh my god the menu's! To call up ship status you have to press enter then 2 and then 1. I am not making it up. You need to punch in a 3 keystroke code just to see your inventory and ship status. Storyline mission is broken. Only way around it is to keep 2 seperate strands of savegames since if one strand breaks you may voided hours of gameplay if you do not have a backup. Trading is broken and so cumbersome and lethargic that only chartered accountants would find any joy in it. There is no radar. And since damage is distributed evenly on your shield you can't see where the shots are coming from. And since the coclpit window is cluttered with ugly mood graphics your "viewport" is basically a keyhole. As if this didn't make targetting hard enough you also have to click the target you want to fire on. Aaaaaand there's the 5 FPS again. Lasers are rated by range and damage. Thats it. No FPS available since there is no shot per second. So is the fased Maser better than the Plasma cannon? Who knows? There is only 3 or 4 of every ship component for your ship and you are stuck in the hideous rustbucket for ever. There is one ship and ONLY one ship. Add to ALL this the constant bugs tedium crash to desktop and other stuff. This is after 14 hours and plenty of reloads CTD's and other assorted "fun". The game might have other redeeming factors but to be fair. Its not the the bugs or gameply thats the problem. It is the entire game. This isn't an unpolished gem. It is a polished turd. Avoid this game at all costs and avoid all Egosoft titles after this one until you have verified their quality.,0,Nearly at patch 1.18 and game still doesn't work.

But as soon as I have explored the further  It go down the toilet. I am sorry Egosoft but this game lacks the charms and complexity of all your other games. It seems like a toy compared to X3 series.,0,I guess you have to have a grudging respect for those responsible for this stinky stinky turd.

This was the game I was gonna get into. But it's just a mess. As other have said this is a game that got rejected by Xbox and has now been ported back to PC. The perpetrators knew they would get a certain amount of sales from fans of the series no matter what they released. They also knew that if they lauded (lied) about a new slick interface and ease of interaction they would get even more sales. So they took a dump and ran off to the bank. Some say it can be patched and modded but you can't polish a turd. You can try but you'll just end up covered in chit,0,I registered myself just to be able to score and review this  this game not!A failure in every way nothing makes sense in this broken wannabe game.,0,This game is a MASSIVE failure.

The head or the accessory he has on it's head?

If you don't feel like saying something better than that don't.,2,The game is a mess. Full of bugs. After the initial patches the game has improved but it is not what I've paid  50 for.

Command wheels(instead of keyboard bindings)? A space ship that more than occasionally wants to 'upright' itself??? Just when you think you're getting somewhere or you're starting to have fun...BOOM! You hit that brick wall where your trader won't trade or your comrades (and even your own ships) won't fight leaving you to do all the dirty work (which was supposed to be the most fun). Or worse yet you have to figure out how to execute some task that's not even remotely clear in the UI and there's zero tutorial help. Go read the forums if you want to see the rest of this carcass. Something told me to wait until January to buy this game. I've been looking so forward to it that I ignored that and got bit by Egosoft once again. End result is that I'm not investing tons of hours into a game that's incredibly broken and released that way despite Egosoft knowing it. They HAD to have known it. I don't believe I can support Egosoft in any further ventures and cannot recommend anyone get X:Rebirth without the expectation of a broken game.,2,That kind of product calls: "Game with Early access" not a "Release".

Buyer beware! (very minor vague spoilers follow just thought I'd mention that to those who are.. picky.) Many people expecting the gameplay of previous games in the series WILL be severely disappointed. X:Rebirth has apparently attempted a new and poorly informed direction and no one knows why. As a first time X series player with no previous expectations I am superbly put off by this game and shocked that they are allowed to charge the price that they do for this amount of low quality. Let's outline some of the areas where you'll probably be annoyed. First thing's first as you take control of your ship you immediately notice the horrible voice acting and rotten choppy framerate. I have an obscenely well built custom computer which i take a bit of pride in and running the game on maximum graphics causes it to have a choppy unplayable framerate. Every so often you notice the graphics engine seems to 'derail' and send you into the abyss of poorly rendered polygon shadows. Voice clips are often choppy low quality and poorly cut. I know quite a bit about remixing music and post processing and the effort is not to spec at all. By your fifth 'Now shut up betty!' you'll understand what I mean. Repeated annoying animations and floating text that will not go away plague you as you try to understand the complicated nature of the menus which are not logically arranged at all. You feel right away that this game was meant for a console. Soldiering on you go to your first station. You are assigned a kill mission and just as you engage your opponent the game locks up. Your first crash sets you back about an hour. Mostly due to the painfully slow flight speed of your bucket of bolts called a ship. You get back to your bounty mission and your bounty target is now attacking you. You put it down with ease yet score a plethora of friendly fire hits on the friendly station which now starts attacking you. Oh yes some real thought was put into this game. Reload your save you restart the bounty mission which has changed and start thinking about how you're going to kill a giant freighter with your small peashooter laser.. so you think you need some new guns first. I did. There are no ship customizations or upgrades beyond that of 5-6 core weapons (which span from mark 1 to mark 3) 4-5 projectile (missile type) weapons and 3 types of forcefields to choose from. Engines and scanners are upgradeable however this is where you notice the cost.. And start to try to create your own trade empire. Or would rather if you could get past the first tutorial mission where you are guided through a 'trade'. Your first freighter seems to get stuck on 'Follow' mode and will never release. There is no 'cancel order' or 'cancel last trip' command. So once this happens you had better have a save or else your game is kaput as you now have no hope of acquiring currency en masse. Even if you do buy another freighter and get something going it eventually locks into the 'follow albion skunk' command. At this point I became frustrated and tossed in the towel. I'm a guy known for liking complex absurdly large learning curve games but this isn't a game. It's a piece of junk that the developer is scrambling to repair before people turn away from their company for good. And because I'm slightly insane I loaded the game again jumped into a superhighway and got randomly dumped into space 1.4M KM away from anywhere with no jump drive. That's about when I hit my threshold. This apparently 'rare' bug is just one of many waiting to frustrate you. People I implore you. Understand that even a RUDIMENTARY quality control program would have prevented any of these issues from occurring but this developer seems to be lacking in common sense. I feel like I've been the victim of a scam as I paid decent money for what I was to understand was a working product yet received a game that should still be in alpha or earlier. If they had stated 'Well we're doing an alpha early-access' that would have been fine with me. But I would not have paid 40 bucks for it let me tell you. Don't make my mistake. Turn your back on this one and walk away. Though there is one thing they got right naming the first ship you get 'Albion Skunk' cause this game just stinks. (they're not getting a point for that though.) And I'm afraid no amount of patching is going to erase that stink since the flaws are on a fundamental conceptual level.,1,It has been a LONG time since I had to manually edit save game files just to proceed in a computer game.  X Rebirth required me to edit my save game files numerous times on the first day.  Broken scripts missing game elements unresponsive AI and other random issues helped me rate this game very low. The graphics of space and the ships stations and weapons are nicely done.

Broken scripts missing game elements unresponsive AI and other random issues helped me rate this game very low. The graphics of space and the ships stations and weapons are nicely done.  The characters in the game look like something from 2003. The voice acting is horrid the actors were obviously recorded in different studios.  Some actors sound like they are talking from inside a garbage can while others sound like they are in an auditorium or in a sound proof box.  The poor voice over work breaks the immersion of the moment. I had to keep the Steam Group Chat open while playing because I would come across bugs so often.  I would ask if anyone help had the same issue and execute their fix or go search the forum for a work around.  I have played game in the past perhaps a decade or so ago where something would go wrong and a quick savegame edit fix solved the problem.  When that did happen it would be a ONE time thing.... with Rebirth I found myself editing my save.xml file several times a day... really?  If I had not the savvy to do this then the game would just ended already. I am done with this game I may come back in a year or so and see if the developers can fix it and maybe the modding community can give it some life.  Overall this is a pile of cold crap... it's not even steaming.,2,To get my overall opinion out of the way this is an exceptionally poor attempt by egosoft. I'm a fan of the x series of games in general but occasionally find them a bit too deep and meaningful you can't just jump and be up and running in a couple of hours.

Rebirth seems like it was designed to be that kind of title  very suspiciously so) however falls flat on its face trying to implement it. Gone are the many many different systems gone are the many many hard to find but ultimately satisfying to get right commands gone is the ability to fly different ships. What do you gain? An extremely poorly voiced and annoying co pilot a single ship with very limited upgrade potential very little control over anything else you own game breaking bugs even in the tutorial section  how can they get this wrong) very poor performance on a relatively high spec machine about 3 different station interiors to explore....with about 5 people to talk to  lots of other annoyances. They've pretty much manages to take everything that was attractive about the previous games and either remove or ruin it. Not sure what the development plan was is or if there was a major shift that we dont know about causing the issues but 7years to produce an unfinished game charged out at £40 a time is nothing short of scandalous. New players will be baffled as of to why they should persevere fans of the series will be disgusted with the changes. No amount of patching will fix this game.,2,All negative reviews sum it up. If they are so low it is to counter those fanboy 10/10 marks. The game is in beta or post alpha stage.

Egosoft has always put much love in fixing it games post release. But here the problem dont lie only with bugs but with design features that were sold to us many times but arent in the game instead we have poor design and loads of bugs. Plague by bugs.Trading not working.Capital ships owned by player not fighting.Quests stuck because of many bugs (i myself made an extensive thread sticked in the Workaround thread on official forum to give many hints on how to bypass them editing savegame so i know exactly what i'm talking about)UI very poor compared to previous titles (takes more actions with keyboard for similar commands)Not even a decent fleet command.Lacking fundamentals key binding like target next ennemy closest and so on.No radar.Very poor map cant read it correctly.Walking in station was a good idea but it is very poorly done you loose too much time in there.And many more that could be said (just check all other negative reviews for anidea). That said this game has huge potential but i wont rate it on its potential but its current state. You probably wont be able to play it within the next month without huge issues forcing you to restart or edit your savegame so for me its a 2/10 right now. Egosoft lied to us selling us awsomeness in all their interviews and trailers even untill a week before release. When they knew their game was so badly tested unfinished (missing small ships dealers and so on). In short they deceived the fans. And i was a very lonng term fan. Stay clear from this and check official forum in 6 months or more to see how the game has evolved.,1,The game is slowly getting patched up to compensate for the catastrophic launch. Whether you have ever played any of the X series or not stay away from this title. It does not deliver a fraction of the features it promised. Read the critic reviews. There is a reason why they are so low.,2,I have played this game for several hours. the sad thing is that the longer i played this game the more bad things i found out about it. it is like they left out each good thing they had in the x3 series and replaced it with bad things.The cockpit is blocking half of your field of view. there are thousands of bugs menus dissapear trading does not work properly there are less shipsI have played this game for several hours. the sad thing is that the longer i played this game the more bad things i found out about it. it is like they left out each good thing they had in the x3 series and replaced it with bad things.The cockpit is blocking half of your field of view. there are thousands of bugs menus dissapear trading does not work properly there are less ships less sectors less action less available commands and of course less fun.

For years Egosoft has been making the X series.  I've been trying to play them and expected the latest to be no different.  Having said this I certainly didn't expect it to be this broken.  And so I can only agree to the numerous harsh critics about not only the technicalities and mechanics being flawed in the game where one cannot do much at all with the state of the game.  It's really not a game anymore but some parts here and there attached together by fragile coding without proper testings on high end systems.  You wonder what a company like Egosoft put into a 7 years plan to make X rebirth to the state it is at release is beyond words.  To rely and exploit solely on the modding community to save their own franchise is appalling and truly demeaning.  There is really no excuse for this sort of base behavior.  An existing ethic committee should be enforcing laws to prevent this from happening just as much as they have decided to prevent piracy. 4 points for bringing a broken game to the table and -3 points for exploiting the modding community to save their "dignity",2,Bad UI confusing game mechanics terrible performance with random fps spikes and drops.I would like to take this a bit further great NPC conversations and dialogue NOT! Fun sandbox EVE single player like concept terrible execution.,2,I'm not going to rehash all that is wrong with this game. My advice wait a year then take a look. It might just might be worth ones time with patches and mods. Right now it's not worth my time. There are far superior games to be played at the moment!,0,As everyone else is saying this is a failed console game ported to the PC to scam a quick buck off unwary consumers.

I simply cannot justify any higher than a 0 rating from a clear scam even if they manage to make it playable with patches it will in no way change the fact that they perpetuated a complete lie to sell pre-orders to their now former fan base.,0,I pre-purchased this game much to my chagrin.  It has delivered on almost nothing promised.  I despise games that take steps backwards.  If its predecessor had the features I believe there is no reason for a game not to have a feature or an enhanced version of or better feature. that being said here are the reasons for my abyssmal rating: Joystick/M+Kb:  At the start as soon as iI pre-purchased this game much to my chagrin.  It has delivered on almost nothing promised.  I despise games that take steps backwards.  If its predecessor had the features I believe there is no reason for a game not to have a feature or an enhanced version of or better feature. that being said here are the reasons for my abyssmal rating: Joystick/M+Kb:  At the start as soon as i realize the ship would not fly I went into customize the keybindings.  Imagine my surprise when I realized this game has a handful at best.  For a PC game the lack of pretty much any keybinding of crucial actions is a joke.  You can change how to open a menu fire some weapons cycle between weapons.  Movement is not included in this.  It took me over 20-40 minutes to find a way to make my joystick work and even then it worked poorly. Dated/unomptimized Graphics:  The graphics in space are decent but nothing out of the ordinary for a PC game for this age; However the FPS in space is a joke and likes to randomly flucuate between 15-40 at sometimes rapid intervals.  This is unacceptable to me and I have never seen a game do it to such a degree on a high end gaming rig.  The NPC's are worse than what you would find in Halflife 1.  The bodies are not at all well designed and the faces are all that of an old woman or covered by goofy visors or helmets. "1 Ship to rule them all!"   We knew this coming in if you read different interviews or forums but no where on the advertising or steam page was it mentioned with good reason.  This would have been a game killer for many people including me had i done more research before pre-ordering.  They went from having a variety of ships and weapons in previous X titles to limiting you to 1 with a poor selection of weapons.  But do not worry you get drones! Like that made up for it. Gameplay:  the tutorial is finicky and nothing seems to go as intended.  God forbid you don't hear a command or can't quite read the objectives text due to its tiny font before it disappears and you are wondering WTF you were supposed to do.  Trade is atrocious and half the time your trade freighter flies in a circular loop as its pilot tries to insert his head up his behind.  There is no such thing as targeting and the  blocks what feels like 40% of your screen so dogfighting is unnecessarily annoying.  You cannot play the game and look at info at the same time as your character feels that he should look down or at otherwise oversized panels to look at where to buy and sell twinkies.  And god forbid you actually to buy said twinkies. BUGS: bugs galore in this game everywhere crashing it making you constantly save and reload less the next step in the plot hits a snag or you get launched into the sphincter of space do to some weird space highway magical mishap. All in all this game looks feels and plays like a horrid watered down console port over.  I do not understand why it took 7 years to develop something like this or why the devs would even try to brag about the length of time it took them to develop such garbage.,0,Epic Fail I can handle bugs quirks and  some save games failing having to restart now and then to restore perfomance getting stuck in lockers grates vents some missions not working ie escort freighter to XYZ to watch it get stuck on a station... enough to get most people riled up i know egosoft will fix it but after a couple days of solid play you cant do whats advertisedEpic Fail I can handle bugs quirks and  some save games failing having to restart now and then to restore perfomance getting stuck in lockers grates vents some missions not working ie escort freighter to XYZ to watch it get stuck on a station... enough to get most people riled up i know egosoft will fix it but after a couple days of solid play you cant do whats advertised trading horrific if it works you have no control of stations which bleed cash 90% of the fighitng is bland and unimagantive or dosent work.

While I have tried and tried again to get through the campaign it is wrought with endless bugs and glitches that make it unenjoyable and unplayable.  The performance droops hitches and bounces all over the place.   Even with the graphics settings turned up the textures all look like they were place holders.   The modeling detail is poor. The development team has reverted the game into a "public beta" state in a failed attempt to fix the bugs and has a lack of communication with the community about its plans its progress and when we can expect.   They haven't even posted on the steam forums in over 2 weeks. I am extremely disappointed in Egosoft.   After being a loyal X-Universe fan since the beginning receiving a game that just plain doesn't work is a huge shock.   I will never ever buy another game from Egosoft.  They might as well liquidate the company and give themselves a slap in the face on the way out. If you care about your wallet and about receiving quality software for your money do not buy this game or support Egosoft by playing it.,1,I'd like to stress that I've been a HUGE fan of the X-franchise ever since X: beyond the frontier. I was aware that this game would not be a "X4" but an entirely new look on the X franchise.

Purpose was to make new gamers enjoy and get comfortable with the franchise and it's economys extreme complexity. A goal I thouroghly embraced. That being said this is perhaps the worst spacesimulation of all times.. I can't recall a game that failed to deliver in this way. It's controls are bad  to put it mildly.. When u're in the  of the only ship u can fly u're pretty much locked in u'r seat with few to no options in regards to view weaponry or other standardised informations  ie. a radar. The fact u can only fly one ship makes the  somewhat strange as u'd think they'd atleast make it a good one  they haven't.. The fact that i lacks all the basics for a functionally  makes u wonder what on earth they spend 7 years on.. Wasn't the complex economy that's for sure.. The economy is non-existent ships fly with little purpose other than the graphical.. If that wasn't bad enough the only ship u can fly is a ugly bucket  which I didn't think was such a problem as they promised a lot of flexibility in the ships modules  they failed to deliver though.. The game promised to make things less complex  hardly achieved.. It promised a more gripping storyline  hardly as all stations look the same and dialogue options is limited to nonexistent.. What it has done is take a franchise and put it's entire future in the twilight of a nebula.. I for one will not recommend this game to anyone and I hope the developers in Egosoft are ashamed for releasing such an unfinished game.. Amazing after 7 years abscense..,2,Most games release with a few bugs. In the bug range from simple ants to gigantic roaches. This game has a swarm of roaches. The flying kind that lay eggs.

It crashes repeatedly. The graphics are outdated (DX9!) and I get frame drops many times on my top-notch rig. There is upscaling for high resolutions. The gameplay is a joke. The menu system is really bad. A 10-year old can do a better UI and interaction design. For instance the objects menu (ships & station parts) is organized as a tree but has a flat table. There is a bug where I can't even launch this ugly and useless sector/system map anymore. Space combat is annoying. Why do I have to maneuver in space to target enemies? Why not use a turret instead and let the player focus on alignment weapons and systems management? Everytime you scan something your co-pilot says the same over and over again as well as the pilots of the scanned targets. You can walk on stations. But that's just boring. There's nothing more to do than to open containers for loot and to interact with badly animated personnel who all look and sound the same. And who had that idea of lanes on the highway?! That looks interesting the first time you use them. But then it gets just annoying. There is no external ship view anymore. And why does the game get a 3D but no freelook. This game feels completely unfinished. It has features that are plain stupid. This "game" requires an overhaul before I touch it again. I hope it does not take another 7 years.,0,Played 20 hours. This is far far from the earlier X games in about all things. It's a totally different style of game (you fly only and always your starter ship although you may upgrade it slightly).

This is far far from the earlier X games in about all things. It's a totally different style of game (you fly only and always your starter ship although you may upgrade it slightly). Controls and interface are extremely 'dumbed-down' console style with all the heavy trade offs you pay for big screen interfaces and the possibility to cram as much complexity as you can into a console-style controller (which of course isn't a lot compared to earlier X games.Where the earlier X games were complex but transparent and straightforward in their menus gameplay general interface etc. this one is oversimplified counterintuitive aimless and unrewarding. Graphics are nothing to write home about (although not totally yesterdays tech) some textures are truly bad and character animation is... sad.The removal of the jump gates and clear division into square sectors of older X titles is nice but without the necessary enhanced abilities of the map system (on the contrary it's a load of rubbish compared to the former X maps) it kills every and all means to relate to the scope and the relative position of stuff. Planning a route yourself instead of stupidly following the autopilot is somewhere between agonizing and impossible.The 'highway' tunnels only give you good speed if you can trail other traffic  but often there is no npc traffic to trail meaning 5 minutes of pure boredom along the tube. Five play-minutes of totally wasted time.Using yellow highway tubes in a region of a yellow nebula where large parts of the background are replaced by a giant yellow-orange-red star means half the time you have no way to even see the damn things.There are no targeting keys at all  and the small edge-of-screen icons are not only small and impossible to see all at one glance they're not even on the edge of the screen but along the edge of your  window. That means you have to search along the jagged edges of your  equipment and hope to spot something and vaguely approximate which direction this means. Even then you have neither radar nor any other way to know which icon is how far away meaning it can be difficult to even determine which of those ten icons is firing at you and which nine others are way out of weapons range. Don't even think about trying to always attack the nearest enemy on an escort just kill them like you get them on screen and double back frequently. It's not totally unenjoyable you can see glimmers of potential but they are so stomped by the terrible execution that no amount of patching will solve the basic gameplay problems. Add to sad sorry state of affairs the fact that the whole game is supremely buggy it features among others:-random crashes-sudden animation failures (which mean no more sliding out of holo consoles which makes lots of stuff uncontrollable because you lack the interface to do so)-horribly bad pathfinding by npc ships you escort through station complexes (escort: 15 min parking afterward before you get paid: 45 min)-frequent graphic glitches This is a really really sad end to a great great series of games. Based on the deliberate design direction they took with this game I doubt we will ever again see an X game fit for more than the trash can. In any case this game would not have been worth more than maybe 2 to 5 dollars in a bargain bin sale not the hefty sum they took for the CE. Probably the last preorder I bought certainly the last ever I buy from egosoft.,0,I find it interesting how other reviewers who give this game good reviews claim to have been able to play it.

Just waiting for the CEO of Egosoft to send me an email asking me for 50 Dollars to help a random contact or relation on the basis he will send me a 50000 dollar cheque in return.

The AI is good the drone handling is fine invention less fatal crashes with other ships and stations and they get rid of the dangerous jumpgates so instead they put in a highway mechanics. Many things flow better now. Still there soo many bad design choices with placeholder npc graphics and animations horribly bad map system (4 layer map. Really now? 1 layer was complex enough for me like in the old days) no time acceleration for otherwise highly time consuming operations like full time trading no (!repeatable!) in-depth tutorial for the new unintuitive interface unless you read the 80 page manual and the list goes on and on... The game could be wonderful but if basics feel bad no one wants to discover the very depth of your game EGOSOFT.,2,Do not buy this game. No amount of patching will be able to fix its inherent flaws. Wait for Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen. Go back to X3TC  AP if you have to. You have been warned.,2,Hey it's more accessible than earlier X titles!...which would be nice if it ran at more than ten frames per second on high end systems.The performance is a bloody atrocity.

It's pretty but it's not THAT pretty particularly at minimum bloody settings.,0,It's not hard to see that rebirth is a botched console port; though even disregarding that it's still a terrible game.First off they have made it so you're stuck in one ship which wouldn't be bad if you could customise it heavily though in reality there are less than ten guns to equip it with.

There are other ships in the game though you can't fly them yourself you have to rely on that being done by AI which once again wouldn't be a huge issue but in this case the AI is heavily broken; ships rarely do what they tell you and even then it takes forever for them to do anything. Orders given to ships are managed through a radial menu optimised for consoles so telling your ships what to do takes forever again.Trading has to be babysat by going to every system you want to sell in and placing your orders at the station meaning that it is slow and tedious there are even silly minigames involving you clicking on certain parts of the station to get discounts once again dumbing down a tried and tested formula that has worked with X games for years.The interiors of just about everything look terrible your single ship has only two rooms that are accessible other than the cargo hold one is the  which you have your view locked in the forward position and the other is a tiny little room with a table and chair you can't sit at the chair. Station interiors have to be visited and are barren and lifeless unless you count the talking tables in the bar which presumably were supposed to have people sitting at them generating background noise. The stations are compulsory too meaning that if you want to hire someone you need to go into the station then look around and find them. I need also mention that stations contain silly minigames too consisting of crawling through the same two vents and opening crates. It should be called X-Miscarriage not X-Rebirth,0,This one was one of my most anticipated games for this year.

Not even close. As a fan of the previous titles this is a huge disappointment. Publishing in this state is unforgivable.,0,After having 100+ hours on this game and with a previous experience on X3:Albion Prelude this is my review: 1. This game has nothing to do with previous X-series. It is a stripped down version with lots of important features missing and it seems deliberately so left out.2. Besides the fact that it is actually still a Beta version the main plot does not work and the game (Ver.After having 100+ hours on this game and with a previous experience on X3:Albion Prelude this is my review: 1. This game has nothing to do with previous X-series. It is a stripped down version with lots of important features missing and it seems deliberately so left out. 2. Besides the fact that it is actually still a Beta version the main plot does not work and the game (Ver. 1.18) crashes very often. 3. It is clearly designed as an Xbox and not a PC game (for example joystick support is missing) with an overall very bad PC UI. The overall performance is bad as well. 4. Based on the above I do not expect any further improvements except existing bug fixes after maybe a  few months but not earlier (yes it is that bad considering also the 'promised' and the 'delivered' besides the deceiving  done by Egosoft). And don't expect any serious modding for I doubt if experienced modders will ever want to get 'dirty' with this stupid implementation. 5. If you are around 10 years old and just want to make a trip around space see some rather good graphics and do some primitive fighting trading and station building you can do it but definitely NOT on this price tag and not now  wait until it is fixed.Furthermore if you are new to this you will spend a lot of time learning and understanding it because there is almost no comprehensive help. You will constantly be under the impression that it is your own fault if things don't work out while it is really the dev's very bad and brain damaging concept and design which is full of holes with hardly any info given. Prepare to spend more time searching through the forums seeking for help than actually playing the game. 6. Having said that just to use the game's motto you can completely forget about proper "Trade" and most importantly "Think" (which is totally absent from this game if not the reverse). 7. If you are an X-gamer DO NOT BUY it. It's really a big piece of garbage and you will be utterly and bitterly disappointed. 8. And last but not least please read the comments and see all reviews about this game on Steam and on other sites too i.e. http://steamcommunity.com/app/2870/discussions/0/648811852715079441/ 9.

No more 'match speed'.- Shaders look terrible.- Keyboard control over-sensitive.- Game-breaking bugs. Those are a lot of deal-breakers. Unlike X3 it is not an incomplete game with gaps the community can fill in. It is a game full of WRONG design choices that will require an amount of dedication from the community unseen of this side of MERP to fix. It's cool that you have an excellent modding community Egosoft but it looks like it'd have been better for you to just straight outsource them during development. I would give this game a 4 because despite it being broken and unpleasant to the point of unplayability (especially when compared to the rest of the saga) it's got some interesting ideas and the developer has been pretty honest up until Rebirth but Egosoft's attitude of what looks like not only over-optimistic previews but also little pre-release information what 3 days later looks like a full-on review embargo until they have some stuff sorted out and not even preparing their forum from what they knew would be an onsaught of unsatisfied customers earns it a 3. X: Rebirth is a 3/10 game. This is shameful. DO NOT BUY until some of the more glaring stuff has been fixed. If that.,0,Well I had waited for many many years for the resurrection of the X series.

I had poured many many hours into X3:TC and could not wait for X:Rebirth so I pre-ordered. It pre-installed fine without issue and thats where the good things ended... I have rated this a fat whooping zero. The reasons are as follows... 1. This 'game'  was designed for a console and when Xbox said no they decided to port it to PC. There are hordes of Xbox entries in the files. This is confirmed by the use of a 'game controller' not a joystick that 99% of us actually use.2. Trading  This is how to make a giant leap back to the past while holding a brown paper bag over your head. Too many steps back and this is now counter-intuitive buggy as hell and quite frankly not fit to wipe my bum. I cannot even cancel a trade request I must load the previous save or edit the savegame file while offline.3. The controller setup  I cannot even map simple keys to my keyboard because this was designed for the Xbox not PC.4. No Radar  WTF seriously? A 4x space game with no visible radar to use while in combat makes it obsolete in the eyes of gamers. Even Elite had a radar you could use easily.5. No Joystick support  nice way to frustrate and annoy all your customer base.6. Docking  Again proof that this was for the console community no manual docking anymore this is for the idiots who cant fly close to other ships.7. Entering the stations  Again a pointless 'visual feature' where you must wander aimlessly around a station looking for people to speak to/barter with. I could go on but I feel I am wasting my time. Maybe in 6mths to a year this game maybe working but its doubtful and I suspect the X community will have to fix all the things that Egosoft broke.,3,Expecting Freelancer instead got Duke Nukem in Space Okay if anyone who hates Duke Nukem Forever or Aliens Colonial Marine you can understand the feeling I have with X-Rebirth. I was expecting a AAA experience with a easier learning curve which is what's been keeping me from getting into the X series in the past instead I got a half-baked game with crappy performance issue uglyExpecting Freelancer instead got Duke Nukem in Space Okay if anyone who hates Duke Nukem Forever or Aliens Colonial Marine you can understand the feeling I have with X-Rebirth. I was expecting a AAA experience with a easier learning curve which is what's been keeping me from getting into the X series in the past instead I got a half-baked game with crappy performance issue ugly textures and low poly character model. I mean I can point you to various game from LAST-GEN has better aesthetic than this game the Character Models for example  What is this? Does it has less polygon than a teapot? How could it possibly looks so ugly anyway? And even if you bump all the effects to maximum  it still looks like crap. The only good looking thing is SPACE and SHIPS (from a distance.).Now the performance is horrendous as well I can run Battlefield 4 Crysis 3 and Far Cry 3 with medium heigh settings at 30~40 fps for this game I can't get 30 fps even if I put all the settings to lowest level. It's obvious this game is rushed or poorly designed. All the above mention is enough to stop me from playing I'm not someone who judge a game SOLELY by it's graphics but all these crap breaks the immersion. When a game with so much promise ended up like this.... it's just a total let down and unacceptable.,3,I'm writing this review with 1.12 patch. I am sad to say that this game is broken full of bugs; so much so that you can't even continue the main storyline if you're not lucky enough. What is more disturbing is the flaws in game design.

I am sad to say that this game is broken full of bugs; so much so that you can't even continue the main storyline if you're not lucky enough. What is more disturbing is the flaws in game design. Map systems don't make sense menus and UI need serious revamps etc. I'll provide a pro-con list below but make sure you check steam forums before buying where you'll see every single forum thread about disappointment. Cons:- Extremely bad performance. The game seems not tested and even the high end PCs don't get good graphic performance. 5-10 FPS in some areas.- Bugs  "Oh my deus it's full of st.." ehem "bugs."- Terrible UI.- Keyboard shortcuts (previously the heart of X games) missing and not possible to configure.- ONE ship. Yes you can ride just one  don't think you'll sit in the bridge of your destroyer.- No direct trade: gone are the days that you can dock a station and trade directly. You need to have a buggy AI do it for you. (Not kidding you need to edit your savegame in an editor to correct AI problems most of the time you trade)- Awful NPC graphics and not the best voice acting.- Voice acting not finished  in some languages.- No autopilot.- Stations can be built on pre-determined spots.- In short: even if the game is fully debugged in a series of future patches this is not the X-Universe game you're looking for. Pros:- The new travel system (higways) seem kind of fun.- potential. since the game is open to modding it is possible for the community to fix this game up at some point.,3,After over 20 hours of play I can pretty much sum this up as a huge letdown.

That is gone along with a number of other basic features. No gravidarAfter over 20 hours of play I can pretty much sum this up as a huge letdown. I can live with poor looking interiors NPCs dialog etc.. but the core components of what made an X game have been stripped down or removed. X has always been a deeply complex game of economic space trading an empire building/management. That is gone along with a number of other basic features. No gravidar (radar)  no targeting/cycling system no move to position/stop/attack commands to ship no naming ships no way to cancel pending trade orders no way to stop ships from following you no autopilot no jump drive no flying other ships no universal traders no parking of large ships at stations. The list goes on an on. The incredible array of ships in X3 consisting of dozens of different sizes and designs weapon types and load-out options software components (wares) upgrades etc. are all gone in Rebirth. Rebirth gives you only a small handful of preset ship types with only a couple of options. The incredible array of factories and stations that made all kinds different intermediate and end products has been cut down to a third of before. Placement and design of complex factories is gone Rebirth only allows building of pre-made designs at fixed locations. The entire economic flow of goods appears to be gone...replaced with simplified artificial system. In terms of the universe while X3 did have issues with large areas of space the was sometimes boring to navigate the alternative in Rebirth isn't worth the trade off. Sectors have been reduced to 3-6 packed "zones" connected by magical highways (no real technical explanation for how humans pull these off). Unlike X3 where non-civilian ships flew with a destination and purpose the ships in Rebirth are mostly eye-candy phantoms. Highway travel is an annoying and unnecessary mini-game with an engine sound effect so jarringly loud I end up just not bothering with the speed boosting mini-game to avoid the awful sound. In X3 you simply hit one key and get a view of all property where is was and what it was doing. Another key would give you a view of your credits and reputation. Those are gone replaced by an ugly drill-though UI screen with a font 3-4x larger than needed that takes numerous key presses or clicks. It is impossible to play Rebirth using only the keyboard like in the past you have to awkwardly switch back and forth between keyboard and mouse while in battle just to target ships or dock. The ship pathing AI a function many fans asked for more polish after X3 is a absolutely terrible. Fighter ships attacking stations or large ships will ram into them and get stuck trying to turn around. Ships get caught in narrow spaces of large ship hangers or parts of stations bouncing back and forth between solid points. In past X games the act of flying a small ship into the solid wall of a station is almost certain death as it should be. In Rebirth collision damage has been almost entirely removed to compensate for the poor AI. Collisions between capital ships and stations has been disabled allowing capital ships to actually fly through stations and each other. This opens an awful exploit where you can pilot you ship into the hanger bay of a capital ship and sit there safe from harm firing and damaging it underneath its shields while on the outside fighters attempting to shoot you end up pound the large ship with friendly fire. There is speculation and some evidence that an attempt was made the bring Rebirth to the Xbox and something went wrong along the way. The  communication/radial menu and ship command UI appear to be three separate designs stitched together and don't flow well a byproduct seen before when software development projects take drastic changes of design direction. In term of immersion and visual the game is an amalgam of ideas borrowed from Mass Effect Blade Runner and parts of past X games with mixed results. Topping all of this off are numerous game breaking bugs that clearly indicate that the final build was not tested. Many game play bugs are far too obvious to have been missed by testing. There are several ways to cause the campaign to get hung up with no notice. For example if you loose a special one of a kind constructor ship given to you in the campaign it makes it impossible to a perform a building task given hours later bring the entire campaign to a halt with no warning or notice. Once of the biggest aspects of X3 was the many (often hundreds) of hours of sandbox style play and the use of mods. With Rebirth once the campaign is complete assuming you make it that far there appears to little else to do with the game with so much stripped out. Fans waited seven long years for this and somewhere under all this mess may be a salvage X game engine if and how long it might take to fix remains to be seen.,3,This game is garbage...a lot of bugs...you can't finish missions...random crashes to the desktop...I can't even believe egosoft felt down so low on quality...their other games were buggy...but playable...none of them was like this...this game is really crap...it blow away all gaming experience with bad cut scenes terrible voicing actors extreme performance issues...terrible stations andThis game is garbage...a lot of bugs...you can't finish missions...random crashes to the desktop...I can't even believe egosoft felt down so low on quality...their other games were buggy...but playable...none of them was like this...this game is really crap...it blow away all gaming experience with bad cut scenes terrible voicing actors extreme performance issues...terrible stations and NPCs texture ridiculous bugs on IA economy trading and overall missions...don't buy it unless you wanna pay to be a alpha tester if you're masochist or if you enjoy headaches.,2,Some aspects of the game are nice.

Another sad thing is that there is only one ship to pilot now. In AP you could go and get fast Boron discoverer and or a big freighter. I miss this. Unfortunately the commercials of X Rebirth featured only the bright sides of the game. They didn't include incredibly boring lame-textured space station corridors (which is generally not a bad idea) and so (can't find appropriate words) awful NPCs. These badly-textured robots is a huge game breaker. I really don't want to see them to talk to them or interact in any way. They are just creepy! Unfortunately one of these space monsters lives in my  even during free game. What's wrong with her clothes? What is this hole in the chest area of her costume for? I can only speculate that this is a trick to drive the look from her face. I'd add 2 points just for a feature of ejecting this monster queen from my ship. So for the space: +2 -8 for everything else.,0,Bought this game in december and now in february still no patch that fixes game crash.

This game is trash on trash. 50 bucks is a lot of money but I am even more disappointed by the fact I have been looking forward to this trash for 6 months. Trash trash trash!,0,Not buy it. This is not a game X series. this is a completely new and different game.1 Ship no radar no SETA no view stats(speed weapon shield etc) no docking comp  no autopilot small map bugs  ugly npc and Indoor station. Its game designed  for Xbox and PS3,1,So where to start? This is so bad i don´t know where to start.Here the only good point I found:Grafics in Space are awesome.Here are the bad points I found:Only one ship to steer directlySpace Stations can only be build at given locationsAweful npc-grafics inside of stationsMany bugs and crashesTrade not functioning.Ach  it it´s,3,I have played all the X2 and X3 games prior to this and was really hyped and looking forward to this game but... it just doesn't deliver anything compared to it's predecessors. The entire mini-game idea (finding boxes trying to get close behind other ships in highways hacking) is just beyond silly and kills immersion. The amount of game breaking bugs is just appaling I have playedI have played all the X2 and X3 games prior to this and was really hyped and looking forward to this game but... it just doesn't deliver anything compared to it's predecessors. The entire mini-game idea (finding boxes trying to get close behind other ships in highways hacking) is just beyond silly and kills immersion. The amount of game breaking bugs is just appaling I have played roughly 15 hours so far and of those 15 hours at least 10 were spent trying to get past a certain bug and the current bug that's got me stuck caused me to decide to just un-install this game wait a few months and maybe try again. I find it much more likely that i'll just go play X3:TC instead which is superior in every way.,0,I tried to play on an absolutely high end PC with three monitors (not supported). I cannot believe that this people finally killed every hope for a revival of my beloved space games (I am 52 years old and played Elite and Wing Commander and many other games having a lot of fun). Where to start? Space looks like a garbage can or is completely overloaded. The characters are very badlyI tried to play on an absolutely high end PC with three monitors (not supported). I cannot believe that this people finally killed every hope for a revival of my beloved space games (I am 52 years old and played Elite and Wing Commander and many other games having a lot of fun). Where to start? Space looks like a garbage can or is completely overloaded. The characters are very badly animated. Have they never seen other games such as Half Life or L.A.Noire? I use a SideWinder Mouse and Keyboard but clicking is somehow without sense. And this ***ing flight through this space routes. Difficult to get out but somehow you do. Then you are somewhere and they ask you to go to another. I bought the special edition and I am sure that I will remove the game from my disk within the next ten days. I do not believe that there is any chance to make that thing become an enjoyable game.,0,I would love for this game to be the next great space sim but it just isn't. Everything about it just feels unfinished as if they waited till the day before release to scramble and throw together anything they had lying around. I am so sorry Egosoft but I just can't support this one.,0,This game is in early alpha phase. to many bugs. no fun to play at the moment. give it some months the community modder will fix the most problems that egosoft cant do. shame on you egosoft!,1,Just awful buggy mess with broken animation  broken missions broken trading just did not work as advertised.The game mechanics have been grossly changed from previous games making it a slog.What did I get for my £40?

The feeling I'm a complete idiot who's been taken for a ride.Got a 1 rather than 0 as some of the space scenes are quite pretty - Disappointed fan of the X seriesWith lots of other space genre games coming out know this is the last game I'll be buying from this studio,3,Played for around 7 hours mainly playing the story.  When I wasn't crashing or the AI being unresponsive it was mediocre.  No where near what the other X games were.  The 3 I give it is only for Graphics (Not Character Models) and Sound they're okay.  They should have stuck with what their fan-base wanted.,3,There is an absolutely great game under this mountain of problems. Don't buy it yet! Follow the development of the game and see if and when they fix these problems. If they do and the game runs smoother has less bugs and is more comfortable then really really buy it! But not now!,1,As a fan from start of X series i am disapointed.I can understand its a new starting game even if it was announced to be the NEXT BIG THING.I can understand there are major bugs  that can be resolvedI can understand it lack of control  that can be addedThoses missing script there are can be reviewed  moddedBut what i cant understand is to let our community think of aAs a fan from start of X series i am disapointed.I can understand its a new starting game even if it was announced to be the NEXT BIG THING.I can understand there are major bugs  that can be resolvedI can understand it lack of control  that can be addedThoses missing script there are can be reviewed  modded But what i cant understand is to let our community think of a masterpiece and when it launched we got that.Nothing is deep this remind me on old series like Master of Orion or Freelancer in more simple. But we are in 2013 !!Boring after hours  stupid AI stupid mini game choices  no core game design is awfull.Many dev have look deeper in the code and we can think it was coded first for Xbox360.That mean the UI is worst on a PC. I give it a "1" sadly  i would have prefered to give a "10" for sure.I feel sad giving this cause behind this there are people working with familly.But its a fail and it need to be known by users and the team leader of Egosoft. So sad after years waiting for this result..,3,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        10 for the beautiful artwork and space environment 0 for game play and interiors.Overall 3 from me. I just like to fly around the outside of the stations and enjoy the artwork  but the rest has been neglected. I get the impression that the budget ran out on creating different stations with diversity. Has potential if opened to a mod creation kit. The navigation map GUI is poor very disappointed. If they had done something like the EVE 3d star maps would have been awesome. All the stations are nearly identical even when you travel to the area that has been isolated for a generation  the bars have the same horrible music loop that has to be muted at that point the Sci fi story completely looses credibility. I bought the enhanced version with extra artwork and encyclopedia and is very good.But the "extra" music is a ripoff cant tell the difference kind of a scam IMO.,3,I really want to like this game.... but it's awful. The graphics are decent the UI is hard to navigate story is below average performance is bad gameplay is... not good and the voice acting is horrible. The pretty screenshots look tempting - but avoid buying this game.,0,I've already commented on this game but after playing it further I have to comment again. It is not like any previous X universe game it is absolutely terrible if you want an actual X universe game if you haven't already get an earlier game you will not be disappointed. If you are thinking about getting this game because you liked the previous games do not get this one. This game isI've already commented on this game but after playing it further I have to comment again. It is not like any previous X universe game it is absolutely terrible if you want an actual X universe game if you haven't already get an earlier game you will not be disappointed. If you are thinking about getting this game because you liked the previous games do not get this one. This game is not like the previous games it is like a bad Freelancer idea of the X universe. Really bad!! If you want meaningful system maps that mean anything good look with that and that's after you find them. It's awfuldon't do it I wish that they hadn't.  They managed to take a superb game and completely mess it up. System maps are terrible navigation is terrible on station graphics are terrible is there a pattern here? If you want to play a space sim go get Elite if you can:] then play all previous X universe games but not this one. The first is better than this and it was released in 1999 I know I played it in 1999. I have a high end system and this game is not good I'm putting it politely it can't even use two graphics cards in parallel odd considering all descent motherboards come with two full speed slots and they have done for at least the last four years! This game has left me feeling so let down after experiencing so much with the previous games.  If the developers are listening go back and build on the previous games forget Freelancer it wasn't even close to Elite. The X universe took Elite to the next level almost there is room for improvement :],2,For me to rate a game 2 or less it has to have ALOT of things wrong with it.It has to be a broken misguided and just WTF game that I am playing. Well this is all three of those and more.When I first learned about X Rebirth I was astonished at the trailers and gameplay I was shown it was being called the Rebirth of Space Sims as they come back into todays modern age.This game is aFor me to rate a game 2 or less it has to have ALOT of things wrong with it.It has to be a broken misguided and just WTF game that I am playing. Well this is all three of those and more.When I first learned about X Rebirth I was astonished at the trailers and gameplay I was shown it was being called the Rebirth of Space Sims as they come back into todays modern age.This game is a kick in the stomach to the above. Usually games with low scores are just called bandwagon jumpers but for once I agree with most of what is being said. When I brought this game as a birthday present last year I was stoked I was looking forward to trying this brand new game that would remind me of the old X wing games or just any space game in general upon installing it I pressed play but the game did not open not only did it not open but I received no crash message or errors so I continued to keep pressing play and ended up racking about 10 minute's of gameplay just by pressing play. A couple of weeks later they released a patch which finally gives you a message stating about the crash and what is wrong. After spending about 2-3 hours trying all these different things to fix it I gave up What I had was something I thought I could never play until two months ago when I finally managed to get it to work. What did I get once I got it to work well I got broken combat ugly Npcs some of the Worst Voices I have ever heard IE "Show me your wares" in a horrific voice a got ugly indoor sections ugly Npcs and a constant frame rate of 10-20 even though I can run most games on 60 fps like Battlefield 4 on ultra Titan fall on ultra crisis 3 on ultra and well you get the story even after finally spending a hour finally getting somewhere I decide to go to sleep happy that I have finally got the game to work. The next day I wake up have some nice breakfast go onto my pc and launch the game guess what happened?  A save game bug wiped my progress so I shut the game down contact steam support and got a refund I was too disappointed with the game I deleted it and will probably never get the game. Well I usually say what the game does right and wrong here but ill leave it to the pros and cons of this terrible game Pro's+ Space looks nice+ The Ships look nice+ Has the capabilities to be something amazing+ Not playing the game Cons- Everything else- Terrible voice acting- Terrible graphics of both the NPC's and the indoor sections- Broken game terrible Frame rate- I got it refunded (Yep that's right it was that bad)- Still broken in many areas I rate this 1.5/10 but I choose two because I am niceThere is also other accounts of them lying about the game through their trailers and it is misleading and well that's it to be honest avoid this for a few 3-4 years until Modder's do something about it I may pick it up for $5 even though I generally do not but I really wanted to like this game but it may just never happen,0,---------------------------------------WARNING DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!---------------------------------------The problems of this game will never get fixed.

They will fix the bugs but not the bad features. Do not buy this game. Just don't. It may look pretty and it may sound interesting but it is a disaster. I tried this game and played to see all the "features" and the game is just so bad. The AI is non-existent Ships can fly through station Graphics. Your ship cannot take damage from collisions. The highway system is just bad. Highways in space is a stupid idea anyways. There is no real challenge in space battles. Your ship is the strongest of all ships your cl****. Larger ships are too stupid to fight you. You can just hide in their hanger bay and shoot them for as long as it takes until they blow up. You are forced to have a geriatric zombie for a co pilot that wont shut up. There are maybe 3 upgrades for your ship. You are only allowed to fly one ship you can never get another ship or fly another type of ship. There is only one flyable ship in the game. You cannot make trades in your ship. You must get others to trade for you. The games trading system is broken. Making a simple trade transaction takes too long (hours). More complex features are missing. The economic system is simplistic at its most complex. Nothing interesting ever happens in this game. There are no random events. There are no powerful enemies. The story is bad. The voice acting is bad. The human NPCs look like filth. The The alien models are all the most basic and uninspired. The makers of this game are **** holes. The Egosoft website is filled with mindless yes men. They will make fun of you if you don't like their game. The egosoft CEO is a jerk. He mocks the fans and tells them what they liked is irrelevant. The company and the CEO forces its employes to troll the Egosoft forums and the internet and post good things about the game. They will outright lie about features the game does not have just to make a sale. Everyone posting a 10 out of 10 on here and giving this game rave reviews are just company shills and trolls. They have no honer. They will mock anyone who liked the older games. They will mock anyone who does not like this current game of theirs. They make fun of Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous. They Ban people on their forums for telling them that their game is trash. They will not listen to any bug reports. They will not get rid of "features" that their old fan base does not like. AVOID THIS COMPANY AND THE GAME.,2,As a fan of the X-series this game needs to be erased from my memory. All the things that made the previous game fun and enjoyable are gone. No more are the various ships you can fly just the one. With the odd change to the hull and screen. While the giant stations and boarding are welcomed it quickly becomes repetitive and the traffic space lanes are just annoying. Very disappointingAs a fan of the X-series this game needs to be erased from my memory. All the things that made the previous game fun and enjoyable are gone. No more are the various ships you can fly just the one. With the odd change to the hull and screen. While the giant stations and boarding are welcomed it quickly becomes repetitive and the traffic space lanes are just annoying. Very disappointing and sometimes broken game from a company that had made some quality space games in the past.,0,Male voice for the player character only?  In this day and age?  I got as far as the first few lines of dialogue looked for an option to change the player voice to female or silent couldn't find it and then instantly stopped playing.  Instant zero.  $60 wasted.,3,after a few hours of suffering through this mess i will de-install the game and forget about it and egosoft. they are clearly on a path i don't want to follow as a longtime gamer. x rebirth shall mark the release in time when i finally stopped pre-ordering titles.,0,game advertised with lies promises unreal gameplay. ended up with unfinished features bugs lags... etc etc...also new updates coming out daily and desperately but without any fix at all making game more unable to play. all i can see about this game that has brilliand advertisement preorders sale and unreal game review to trick people to buy the game. TERRIBLE do not buy it,1,How could you kill the X series that easy???,0,Having played for 20 hours now i can safely tell you this isn't a true X game. If you look very closely at both the fact this game has 7 years in development and that it's originally designed for xbox you'll realize they knew it failed. It failed and they released it for PC. Sure the visuals are nice but the game doesn't even fit within the lure of other X games. First and foremostHaving played for 20 hours now i can safely tell you this isn't a true X game. If you look very closely at both the fact this game has 7 years in development and that it's originally designed for xbox you'll realize they knew it failed. It failed and they released it for PC. Sure the visuals are nice but the game doesn't even fit within the lure of other X games. First and foremost the game doesn't even work. For $50 on opening day that is abysmally bad. Trading is terribly hard to do and buggy. Boarding ships is bugged. AI is buggy. Campaign is buggy. I'm not sure anything really works as intended except the highways and missiles. The game wasn't originally X. Think about it; 7 years in development? It's just a generic space game for consoles that 2 years ago when Egosoft (so ironic of a name) announced it and presumably spent all this time pasting X lure all over the game. The ships aren't the same however. The guns don't even follow similar naming schemes (a whopping all 4 of them) nor do aaaaaall 4 missile types. The races aren't even all there anymore. Don't even bother trying to control capital ships either. It's mind-boggling how bad and hard it is to make them do what you want. On a side note you're locked to one ship and you must walk around copy pasted stations to get anything done. Playing this game is like strangling an elephant by hand; damn near impossible.It might be worth $10-15 only because of the nice scenery it offers you. For me; i wish i had a refund.,1,The game is utter cr*p.A friend beat me to buying it first which saved me from making the mistake. Problem is he doesn't talk to me any more because I pushed him to buy this (I own all X tittles except this one and he doesn't).We spent many hours to prove ourselves wrong.Let me take out the SINGLE thing that is fantastic in this game: The view of space stations (FROM SPACE only).The game is utter cr*p.A friend beat me to buying it first which saved me from making the mistake.

Fantastic.Then?There are a million bugs. Some just kill the game you cannot move the story forward etc. Eventually Egosoft will fix most of them (give them 2-3 years  as their history shows) but what I cannot stand is that the game broken IN CONCEPT!Let me see... - Vital commands are missing. Your ships for example follow you wherever (crashing into structures in the process) you cannot tell them not to. - Console controls. Actually BAD console controls as I tried using my X360 controller and I was still missing so many things. The games was intended for console. It almost "yells" "CONSOLE". WAY WAY worse controls than X:AP. People have found X360 strings in the files too but let's not get into conspiracy theories. - (Non-)Immersion #1. The game forces to do everything using NPCs. Thing is... NPCs look like a 10 years old game. Bad textures they don't move at all (I MEAN EVER even if you visit the station after a month) they reply incoherently their lip syncing is German even when they talk English (yes like old Chinese karate movies) and to actually make them talk you need to point at a SPECIFIC box not just point to the person. - Even whatshername the NPC that actually is next to you as your assistant... They didn't take the time to at least make HER better (and I don't mean even bigger breasts). - (Non-)Immersion #2: Stations themselves? Tiny. You open boxes you cannot close (WTF?) you get stuck in environment (ok that's a bug I said I would bother with bugs) ah... and almost all look the same (yes even where the boxes are). - (Non-)Immersion #3. All these would be "tiny" if the game didn't actually use them as core game elements. Your own ship interior (and ALL stations too but let's concentrate on your own ship)... Textures must be 32x32 pixels or something (yes I am talking about textures like coming from System Shock). They look totally cr*ppy. - On with the (non-)immersion... You cannot move your "head" in the  you are stuck looking forward or for certain functions turn right to face the (cr*ppy looking) assistant. UNBELIEVABLE. - List goes on... You cannot see your ship from outside there is no autopilot (yes there is no autopilot!) the "highways" have a stupid "slipstream" mini-game (WTF!) viable way to gather some money is to open station boxes (those that cannot be closed) even with station security "looking" at you and get what is inside there is the introduction of double-click (YES DOUBLE CLICK like on desktop) for some actions which must be the most counter-intuitive thing I've seen in a game for years... I can go on forever. Funny detail (possibly because game is an XBox game actually): Each save is around 25megs. So 40 of them is a gig. Would be ok with our huge disks these days BUT... Those 25MB ARE XML (i.e. TEXT) FILES that you can compress to around 1MB each. No.. Egosoft didn't add this stupidly easy procedure to save routine. Now knowing Egosoft assuming they survive from the sales this stupid excuse for a game will make they will patch serious bugs in the next six months to a year many more bugs in the next two three years around the time a "2.0" version will come that will be what 1.0 should be today. Then assuming this game builds some fan base (yes people fall for whatever) they will eventually make a 3.0 that will include some things from the fan base wishlist most actually implemented by mods... for free. Way to go Egosoft. Many people are looking into getting a refund (knowing Steam they won't get it). Save the money for something else people. I am not buying it even when (it's not a matter of "if" it is a matter of "when") it goes down to budget title prices. Good thing there are at least two nice "space saga" games coming sooner or later. Sorry friend for tricking you into buying this game.,0,Just for this game I made an account  because I really wanted to give it a 0.Seriously give my money back the game is broken.I smell a console game that din't work and they just patched it up trew it on the pc to make some money.This is an utter scam 7 years of development....... sure.....- allot of stations  yup true but only what maybe 4 models?- npc  jup allot of them butJust for this game I made an account  because I really wanted to give it a 0.Seriously give my money back the game is broken.I smell a console game that din't work and they just patched it up trew it on the pc to make some money.This is an utter scam 7 years of development....... sure..... - allot of stations  yup true but only what maybe 4 models?- npc  jup allot of them but only maybe 8 models? and they all look 100 years old.- trading? ye.... no not realy  your trade ships have the IQ of a chipmunk.

No more! X used to feel huge. You "felt" space the emptyness the distances. No more and the reason is the highways. Space may be a lot larger now but since you useMost of it has been said already so I'll talk about "feel" more than the specific game mechanics and problems since the old X series made you "feel" like you were in space with all possibilities at your fingertips. No more! X used to feel huge. You "felt" space the emptyness the distances. No more and the reason is the highways. Space may be a lot larger now but since you use highways from zone to zone and you see (nearly) nothing from the highway you essentially only fly around in these zones. Stations are very close and traffic is dense: Not the vastness I used to love anymore.For me exploring is seeing something tiny in the distance and flying closer to explore. Not seeing something clearly and just fly a little closer. Oh and it is not flying close to the module but close to the "i" icon: If you happen to be at the other side of the module you don't see the "i" and learn nothing. Another thing about the highways: Where do the 100's of ships come from that are flying in it??? They are definitely not entering them and definitely not existing them. They are only "spawned" there for the mini-game. Not only this ruins the feel of a "real galaxy" but also this: Why the F are they all so much faster than you? In the zones this is not the case so what kind of "secret" technology do they have that our ship hasn't??? Again a big immersion breaker. "Immersion" was available in the old X in spades. And talking to people on stations would be fine if we would actually build a relationship that would aid us in the future not for 1 trade:S Talking is therefore a small gimmick for a single bonus and not the long-term investment that you could make. A simple "station-module" rating would have brought this better: Trade a lot with a module or do missions for them and you gain rating gaining bonuses and discounts. . Then there is this "real" economy they are praising on about. Well why can't AI controlled modules/companies go bankrupt then? Do they have infinite funds? Apparently so. They could have invested a few months in bankrupcy and AI creation of new stations/modules to flow with demand. If you as a player would disrupt production of let's say Energy Cells other modules would go bankrupt and new solarfarms would be created by AI to meet demands. Then there is the "building an empire": How? How the hell are you going to manage 60 ships dozens of stations and so on. Most players can't get there single trader to do what we want. I can't see this will be possible. Then there is the "looting" on stations. How are we suppose to feel immersed in a simulation of a real world when you can loot without punishment. And not only do we have 1 locker somewhere that is unlocked either. No you can loot ALL lockers. This makes no sense in a simulation and completely ruins immersion.Even more so how am I carrying all that loot??? There's spacesuits entertainment consoles and many other things I'm looting. How the hell do I sneak that stuff out and how is it fitting in a small box or a locker in the first place? Then there is the inside of your ship. Yeah we can walk around in to... Oh sorry but not in your  of course. And nothing works or interacts in your ship. Okay so then we will simply enjoy "our" ship by the looks you might think? Wrong again! The textures are at horrible and I do mean HORRIBLE resolutions. Why??? Even if they don't have the money to create elaborate textures using simple textures at high-res is not more expensive that simple textures at low-res. Drawing them in hi-res takes the same amount of time. My only conclusion is that their engine performs SO BADLY that they had to do this to make the game even run at the sh*tty framerate they now have. Must be a very bad engine is my conclusion! Then about the characters on stations. Why not build a character generator? Nice for a player to customize the avatar AND the solution to randomize NPCs in stations. And another thing about the NPCs. Why am I trading a 1000 space suits with a woman in a lockerroom??? Where is she storing them? Shouldn't she have like a warehouse or shop or something? Would have made the stations a lot nicer to. One final thing: If you have a bad reputation ships will start attacking you. If you fight back in order to save your life your rep becomes even worse. How are you EVER going to get a better reputation after that? It becomes a vicious circle that you cannot get out of. Good luck with that! To conclude my rant: There is no depth to the world. None! Most new features are about single advantages and add nothing real to the game. The only thing that remains is your reputation which isn't new to X. Space became larger and small at the same time. It has become a chain of mini-games (highway sweet-talking fly-by's) that push the "sandbox" to the background and frustrate you with "chores" not "adventures". My advise: Play X3 with the XRM or Elite or Star Citizen for combats. Stay away!,1,$50 AUD for a game of this quality is absolutely unacceptable. The released version feels like an Alpha test given that all the promised features are still under development and the sheer amount of crashes and bugs that riddle this game. As a new comer to the X-series I dearly want to like this game.

The storyline especially is absolutely unworkable the only recommended fixes are re-coding your save games. Really?

Hard to believe it took them this long to come up with what they presented. For now save your money.,0,This game is a shame a dumbed down spatial game ripped off any interesting stuff. Be prepared to visit always same corridors on stations and open crates everywhere like a mario taking gold coins... combat is boring as hell no tactics no skills (there is auto aim)... you can not fly other ships... oh my what a waste of money!,3,I have bought this game at release day paying hefty 65  for Collectors Edition because I wanted to support the developer.

Instead I'll try to summarize it in one phrase... X-Rebirth is to X-series what Dust 514 is to EVE...only much worse.,3,As an iteration of an otherwise decent series X Rebirth is devoid of the fun immersion and exploration its predecessors provided.  There are bugs.  Progression killing game crashing bugs... but I'll leave those alone since those can be patched away.  My issue with this game is its measurable lack of good design vetting and failure to adhere to principles the X license had established.As an iteration of an otherwise decent series X Rebirth is devoid of the fun immersion and exploration its predecessors provided.  There are bugs.  Progression killing game crashing bugs... but I'll leave those alone since those can be patched away.  My issue with this game is its measurable lack of good design vetting and failure to adhere to principles the X license had established. User interface is disjointed... requiring mouse or keyboard clicks in some parts radial menus in others but all carrying a theme of trying to compress a lot of options in a tiny interface.  It is painful to navigate.  Many parts feel like differing developers contributed to varying aspects of the interface without clear direction decisive design or team coordination.  Maps and spatial navigation are painful to use.  Property management and wingman control are also painful to navigate. Voice acting is detrimental to the immersion.  Many of the quips NPCs repeat are juvenile and usually jarring in context. "Nice conversation Not!".  Well... I'm glad I didn't hire that NPC as a manager for my economic empire. This title is plagued with incongruous design elements that seem like overall management and design of the game had no clear vision.  Game-play is a mix of space simulation and arcade mini-games that again indicate a grab-bag development approach that lacked singular design vision or focus.  Space flight feels somewhat true to the series.  Approaching jump gates and intersecting with space lanes feels suitably majestic then wham... you enter and traffic in the "highways" miraculously appears to facilitate a "drafting" mini-game that feels like a console arcade throwback.  I was half expecting acceleration pads and banana canons. You are deprived of exploring and piloting the myriad of alien ships that were so prevalent in prior titles.  You now have a single ship with only a handful of upgrades and options.  There are no point-of-view options. Situation Awareness during dogfights took a significant dive.  There is no radar maps are useless and target locking requires clicking with the mouse.  If your mouse lacks extra buttons you need to fire missiles via keyboard or a joystick bind. Control customization is lacking.  You cannot change mouse binds.  There is no multi-controller support so HOTAS fans that have discrete controllers will be unable to configure a suitable setup.  I gave up and went with throttle-and-mouse.  Many ship features such as sensor settings cannot be bound and have to be triggered through the convoluted menu system. I have a monster of a PC so I cannot make any statements about hardware scaling but there were times the game would slow.  In my mind this is acceptable since this allows scaling up the options as hardware performance improves. Overall wait for community to make something of this sow's ear.  3/10,3,I SO wanted this game to be good. The character models are very dated which wouldn't be so but if the voice acting was good which it isn't. Conversations with traders frequently end in "Good talk  NOT!" I mean come on. The graphics in space are pretty and they did a great job on the visual effects for stations and ships but graphics alone don't make a game. The UI was horrible andI SO wanted this game to be good.

The graphics in space are pretty and they did a great job on the visual effects for stations and ships but graphics alone don't make a game. The UI was horrible and clumsy. The only thing that worked albeit at a mediocre level was a console controller. The menu system was tedious and not intuitive in the least. The worst part was the frequent crashing game breaking bugs and constant glitches. Over the 8 hours of my gameplay the game crashed 4 times I've had to restart from a previous save because of game-breaking bugs 6 times and I can't even count the amount of small glitches that crept into the game. That and the scene load times even on a high-end machine were awful. It took maybe 10-15 seconds for an area to load up (particularly bad when docking). Over-all I give this a 3/10. It still has promise if they polish it up and maybe add some features that remove the clunky feeling (auto-pilot anybody?).,1,This game is not x4 this is the defense by the devs. Ok i have never played x3 or any x game.

Ein halbfertiges Produkt welches entgegen der Behauptungen in den diversen Interviews im Grunde genauso schwer und unübersichtlich vom Einstieg her ist. Das Tutorial selbst ist ein Witz man wird von A nach B gescheucht Verständnis für Zusammenhänge muss man sich selbst zusammensuchen. Bugs ohne Ende selbst bei einer Tutorialmission fehlen Missionsbeschreibungen und genaue Orders. Stellt man sich in einer Station direkt vor ein Lüftungsgitter und öffnet dieses wird man wie von einem Gabelstapler von dem Gitter in die Luft gehoben und in eine Position gebraucht in der man sich nicht mehr bewegen kann - natürlich kann man das Gitter auch nicht wieder schließen - hier hilft dann nur der Shortcut um sich direkt ins Raumschiff versetzen zu lassen. Die Grafik ist im Weltraum ganz ordentlich auf den Stationen allerdings unterirdisch schlecht. Außerdem ist "Leben" auf den Stationen wirklich was Anderes. Ein paar lieblos hingeklatschte NPCs und das wars. Der Aufbau ist zudem in den Innenräumen immer gleich. Ich könnte mit Kritik nun hier noch gefühlte Ewigkeiten fortfahren aber ich habe keine Lust mehr mich mit dem Spiel zu beschäftigen und Ihr sicher nicht aufs Lesen. Mein Fazit: Ich bin unsagbar enttäuscht von Egosoft. Alles im Vorfeld war nur PR-Gelaber. Ich sehe auch den Grund warum keine Demo und kein ordentliches unabhängiges Review da war / gewünscht war. Ich kann nur jedem raten sich das Geld zu sparen - das Spiel ist es einfach nicht wert.Mein Wunsch ein kleines deutsches Entwicklerstudio zu supporten war leider übermächtig der Vernunft. Nie wieder.Kauft lieber eurer Freundin / eurem Freund was Nettes da hab ihr und er/sie mehr von.,3,ok soooooooooooooo I was expecting like (sins of a solar empire  meets x universe) with better graphics -- meaning  I invest into my empire  I care for my ships and am attached to them  but have capital ship battles that are epic and more enjoyable than the previouse x games then also incorporate a character system like the new shadow of mordor  where you hunt down a capital shipok soooooooooooooo I was expecting like (sins of a solar empire  meets x universe) with better graphics -- meaning  I invest into my empire  I care for my ships and am attached to them  but have capital ship battles that are epic and more enjoyable than the previouse x games then also incorporate a character system like the new shadow of mordor  where you hunt down a capital ship because he laughed at your weakness in the early stage of your empires begging's and the traits of that character are different from another enemy capital. ii wanted to see like a fable system where your actions created your own character  effecting everything from trade to ship purchases...

The problem of this game at this rate is not the bugs or the future paths the main problem is the playability. If you want a space 3d shooter with legacy Xbox graphics some economic features and waste a lot of times in stupid routines (about 5 minutes searching inside stations instead doing in 5 seconds this with the ship docked like in previous series) OK this can be your game but the score must not be over 5. If you like a true space sandbox with good trading and exploration the legacy X2 is still far better than this.... This game lost the "soul" of the X series I try to find some fun in the 2.5 release but the main problem is still the playability economic simulation IA the whole universe instead the bugs. Sorry for my bad english.,1,I heard about this series from friends so I jumped right in to this game. BIG MISTAKE.

They advertise a thriving economy in which your actions effect the world. NO you build a station and nothing comes to trade. You build a capital fleet and the fleet doesn't work. The ships don't go mine like they are supposed to. Your drones don't come back to your ship. Unless you are in system with your ships they just sit there waiting for you instead of following their orders. I spent about 100 hours playing this game. Then returned to put in another 20 hours several months later. Then again several months after that. NOW the developer is releasing an "expansion" yet the vanilla game features still don't work. Why are they developing new content instead of fixing the vanilla game? Well the only thing I can come up with is that this game is so broken fundamentally that they can't fix it. Save your money buy anything else this game is one of the top 3 worst piles of junk I have ever played in my 30 years of gaming.,0,This game isn't even an X game has nothing to do with previous games seems like they wanted to make an x game for console but didn't want to start in the middle of a series so they started with this bad game; thus why there isn't an x4 in the title.

Anyone who played any of the X games will know that. They "consolized" it they ripped it off of the best features they introduced features that are not only useless but also (and especially) NOT FUN at all. I will not enumerate these because lots of other ppl already did.Ok this is the best starting point for any X:Rebirth review: This is not I repeat this is NOT an X-series game. Anyone who played any of the X games will know that. They "consolized" it they ripped it off of the best features they introduced features that are not only useless but also (and especially) NOT FUN at all. I will not enumerate these because lots of other ppl already did. I made an account here just to be able to say this because in 30 years of gaming I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A BAD RELEASE! And that is not even what pisses me off the most because besides the game being something impossible to describe it is SO OBVIOUS that they knew of all of the problems the game had. Why else were there no reviews or previews? Come on 7 years in the making and NO ONE in the specialized mass media could test it? Hmm I wonder why... What are these guys on egosoft trying to do? Putting out another unfinished game (the most unfinished game in the X universe ever)? And I s*it you not this is so bad and unfinished that even when the modders and everyone else in this fabulous community that lives around the X series fixes it it will still be AGES away from any of the other X's. Why? Because no matter how optimized modders will make this no matter how many scripts ppl will come up with to make trade systems usable no matter how many new ships to use ppl will provide this game is broken from the start from an X pc player perspective. So remember this and let's talk a year from now: EGOSOFT WANTS THE MODDING COMMUNITY TO TRANSFORM THIS PILE OF  INTO A CONSOLE PLAYABLE GAME. They provided the starting point a bad console game. And a very bad one at that. Modders will optimize it (as they always did with other games of the series and egosoft always did use the modding community's work on their next release) and Egosoft will try to put this S*H*I*T*T*Y mirrored image of an X game in PS4 or/and Xbox one. I cant think of any other explanation. I really can't. I mean take out SETA and the gates even if it doesnt work well in the game I get that the intentions may be good. They want ppl to play more instead of just looking at the map and giving autopilot orders. I mean some of the new features could eventually work in the game. Space is definitely bigger this way without sectors as before. but all of the other things... For instance the interface? THE INTERFACE MY GOD??? Why should I be forced to run through 5 menus and submenus just to ask someone where the nearest drone trader is???? And needing to get within 1 meter of any station to get the info... I mean in 2013 we have the internet and information flows through our head at the speed of light and in whenever in the future egosoft wants to put us we need to scratch the paint of our ship on a station to know what they do there. And there are no computers or cell phones so ppl WILL HAVE TO GO AND WALK MINDLESSLY through deserted space stations to do things that today dont even force me to get up my couch in my living room. Ppl do not want to talk to npc's just to buy or sell stuff ESPECIALLY if these npc's are ugly models with bad textures always in the same spot not moving and inside "space stations" that besides being empty and ugly and buggy seem to be the same exact station everywhere. Look if this was something you COULD do in game it would be nice. It is not nice because it is something you HAVE to do especially when what you in fact want to do (sell/buy something) could and should be something you would do from a distance or without having to manually search for a merchant. No Amazon or Ebay-like things in Egosoft's future I guess... Come on egosoft. If you wanted to make the X series easier to get into (and I agree with that idea its not very cool to need 2 weeks of tutorials and youtube videos to learn the basics of a game and thats what I had to do when I got into the X universe) you KNOW this was not the way to do it. It wouldnt be that hard to make a GOOD tutorial to the best mechanics that emerged from X:3. And new plots. New ships. New features. What you made is not that. And I am not saying that is entirely bad I mean if you wanted to make a new game thats up to you guys. BUT DONT CALL IT X. This is not an X game. I'm not talking about the bugs and the 10 fps in quad core-8gbram-2gb gpu machines; I mean thats bad enough to launch something in that state. But to trick the people that helped you make the last 5 or 6 games in this series into thinking you were working on a new game for them when you actually were making something both NEW and EXTREMELY BAD... Well that is just sad. Optimize it and mod it all you can I think this will never be an X game. X series modders: Unite in any way and make what X:4 should be. It cannot be that hard considering everything this community made so far. Forget Egosoft they lost all the respect they deserved after this.,2,The game has a tremendous amount of potential and I can think of nothing like it other than other games in the X series.

Why?I've never played any of the other X games so I don't know how this compares. But taken on it's own it seems like it's someone's "grand vision" that got hit with major feature creep and finally had to ship or it would never ship at all.I've only played up to the point where I have to deliver the captain to my trade ship (I think itSo this was in development for 7 years right? Why?I've never played any of the other X games so I don't know how this compares. But taken on it's own it seems like it's someone's "grand vision" that got hit with major feature creep and finally had to ship or it would never ship at all.I've only played up to the point where I have to deliver the captain to my trade ship (I think it is). I actually had to save and go online to figure out how to deliver her. It's not that there's a lot of actions that the UI needs to account for it's the fact that it's so fcking unintuitive it fights you at every turn. So how do I deliver my captain. Well there's this tiny little green icon that when I double click it I'll get the docking menu. Again why? They could of either had double clicking the entire ship when in range opened the dialog or have an obvious docking platform to click on but a small green icon in the captains HUD?So far the whole UI seems to be designed so that the developers can say "It's a complicated game folks see all the different UI elements we had to use!". You can have a complicated game with a simple and intuitive UI it's not that hard to do.I also find that so far the surrounding in space is crowded to the point where it's claustrophobic. Well it's nice that space is populated so there's something to interact with it just doesn't feel like space. Add to that the fact that everything has information attached to it and it's really easy to be hit with information overload. The first battle with the 2 drones was like that.Which brings me to the only space station I've been on when I hired my captain. Small but with no one on it except for traders and other essential NPCs. It just doesn't feel alive no ones walking around. You have a really weird conversation system that has no underlying logic to it. And the worst thing? You have to maneuver yourself so that the NPCs are facing you or they won't talk to you. You can't click on them and have them turn around to face you? Nope. They ignore you and your conversation jumps to the next NPC facing you. As for the stealing system it again feels incomplete. You open lockers right beside the guard with no reaction at all.Then there's the graphics. they're so hit or miss it actually makes the bad ones seem worse. For example there's a panel on the ship that the texture is so low rez that you can actually see the stair step effect on the letters. And this isn't up close either it's at a normal viewing distance.I could go on and on but the truth is this looks like a game that could of been good even great but poor design decisions jump out at you at every turn. I'm almost put in mind of DukeNukeEm forever. It's like it was a labour of love and everything was sacrosanct to the developers so nothing could be reavaluated to see if it was working or not in regards to the overall game. So they struggled to get everything that they wanted into the game and more importantly get all the design elements to come together and work as a whole. And finally just started running out of resources and had to quickly slap a coat of paint on the thing and get it out the door.Sigh like so many others before it I just have to wonder what could of been. As it stands now even with alot of patching to fix the normal and not so normal launch day bugs/issues I don't know if there's any way that the developers can fix the underlying problems of simply just a poorly executed design. Maybe like CD Projekt RED did with the first Witcher game they'll polish and refine all the glaring problems till they have a much better game. Then both issue a patch to current owners and a new improved release version. Then again those Witcher guys are a one in a million so I wouldn't hold my breath.,0,As a fan of previous X series I AM disappointed. This game had huge potential.

I very much like new station complexes they are huge and look amazing I like ambient traffic and activity which is very cool and makes a living world I like theoretical concept of free space and more playable areas except predefined sectors (like it was in previous X's) I like expanded crew idea a lot of different professions and ability to assign subordinates for commanders (in previous X's almost with anything you had to micro-manage and it was very time consuming if you had big empire) to make something work autonomous but everything else is such a shame: 1. No basic stuff like radar (and/or minimap) hotkeys for example to select nearest target2. UI is very uncomfortable to use your only ONE ship  is not interactive at all and blocks a lot of view not possible to rotate your head3. Repeated dialogs and phrases of NPCs which you start to hate after several hours of gameplay4. Almost entirely identical station interiors which you already hate5. Impossible to talk with NPCs remotely and you are forced to dock each time and you're not really sure you will find the one you're looking for sometimes you get direction for the one who is red (low reputation and he won't speak to you)6. Impossible to give any basic commands to you subordinate ships (only to form up squad)7. Map is almost useless and navigation is hard you sometimes can't figure out where your ships are at all8. Game crashes very often like at least one time in an hour but really this would not be a problem if gameplay was fine9.  mini-games everyone... crate/locker hunter simulator  REALLY? That's the most  idea ever it feels like this one came from some 10years old child. Unlimited personal inventory... enough... I really don't understand. Are developers not playing the game itself? Are they blind? How at least mentioned basic stuff is missing? It's enough to play a few hours to understand all problems. On the other side they probably seen all this but couldn't change anything and simply released crappy game for everyone to choke on. Probably I can continue this list if I would make additional notes while playing to remember every damn negative bit of this game but what's the point... Like with rome 2 total war the most important thing  money collected. I don't like how this is going and I'm almost sure nothing will change except if they will make another "NOT X" game and name it as "X".,0,My first review got deleted somehow so here we go again.

I am completely stunned by the amount of X Rebirth/Egosoft apologist that rushed to give this game a blatantly biased 10/10 score. This game provides very little in terms of game play compared to previous X titles; it actually took more away from the genre instead of brought fresh ideas in. The in-space graphics may look fancy at first but it soon begins to lose its appeal when you realize how cheesy they are. In-station graphics are atrocious not to mention the abysmally abhorrent NPC character design and modeling. All stations are the same inside and visually blandly designed providing very little replay value and stripping bare all the fun of discovery and adventure. The game UI is clearly designed for console yet it doesn't even have full joystick support. Keyboard/mouse support is terrible as the major advantage of mouse over a controller  precision  is useless in this game. UI may seem simple and accessible at the first glance but what it really does is only to complicate easy tasks that can usually be done via a single click and stretch it out to a sequence of non-intuitive actions. NPC dialogues are boring and feels completely out of place  really people simply don't talk like that. And don't even get me started on the terribly voiced dialogues; it only makes me wonder how much of the budget actually went to hiring voice actors and were they ever being directed professionally. Game play is several step backwards from previous X titles. There is only one ship you can fly and the progression is done from no other than upgrading your weapon from Mk.I to Mk.V. How boring is that? I can name more than several free flash games that have a better progression system and keep the player hooked. The game also inexcusably stutters on my only recently built $1000 gaming machine even on all low setting; I can barely get 40fps even when nothing at all is happening and it practically made combat an experience impossible to enjoy. TL;DR: This game should not have passed QA control. It's beyond redeemable for a $50 game seven freaking years in development.,0,Feels/plays/looks like a bad console port to PC. Performance is rubbish. Is nothing like the X games we all love.

I doubt they'll ever release another title like or better than X3. This game is literally the death of a franchise  witness.,0,This game was in no way ready for release.  Aside from the bugs and freezing such as during the station interiors there are so many bad design decisions.

Aside from the bugs and freezing such as during the station interiors there are so many bad design decisions.  The cockpit view fills my POV with needless clutter and obstructs the view of outside space.  What is the point of having awesome space environments if you are looking at it through a tiny window? Then there is the whole nonsensical station interior gameplay where your character wanders around and scoops up anything not nailed down.  That isn't trading.  That's scavenging and stealing.  Instead of the convenient comm based interaction with stations or mission givers or being able to see what is for sale at a station we have to land and wander the station looking for that one person that we need.   Only then we find out they are not in this section of the station and we have to get back into space and land at another landing pad and repeat the same process. The control interface clearly shows this was designed first and foremost with consoles and any PC release was an afterthought.  Paging through multiple menus just to do a simple and common task is infuriatingly annoying. Suffice to say that X Rebirth has managed to take just about anything that worked with X: Terran Conflict and previous X games and thoroughly break it or render it a chore rather than enjoyable gameplay.,0,das spiel ist das letzte es ist einfach kein x spiel mehr alles was spaß gemacht hat wurde aus dem spiel entfernt ich frage mich was egosoft in den letzten 7 jahren gemacht hat  oder auch nicht,0,I cannot award this game any points as it is not a finished product. Day one of release the CEO of Egosoft submitted a public apology for bugs that they state managed to slip through.

Day one of release the CEO of Egosoft submitted a public apology for bugs that they state managed to slip through. I find it hard to believe Egosoft released a product that they felt was finished given the sheer quantity of bugs and their effect on gameplay. You simply cannot play this game more than a couple of hours without running into a fleet of game breaking bugs. The only real minigame I've found is the one where you alt tab to research workarounds for the broken core mechanics you run into every 15 minutes. Egosoft had you released this as a $50 beta to play test and help refine while building your funding I could have easily given this game an 8 as a work in progress and would have happily watched as it grew. Instead you attached a premium price tag to a broken game that you shamelessly peddled as "a new title to bring life back to the genre". The way you have marketed this game and opened it up to consumers profiting from a game not broken but rather not nearly finished is downright criminal. I hope Steam recognizes this and preserves their integrity by distancing themselves from you your product and removes your game from their selection until you can get your act together.,1,This game is fun when it works but the constant need to find a work around after each crash or game stopping bug is too much for me. I give up on this game offering any enjoyment in the near future.This game does not deserve a score based on what it could be fact is without looking for work around you cannot finish it.,4,After i played this title I have some questions: Why I bought this game? Why EGOSOFT has created a game so outrageous? This software is not up to other space games. X3AP is better than this game. Even Evochron is better than this title. My only regret is the fact that the game is on STEAM otherwise it would sell right away. DON'T BUY. For italian player: NON COMPRATELO!!!

Don't let it fool you this game should a free alpha from the mid-2000's at best.  The only positive thing I can say is that the space environments would be beautiful except for the fact that 50% of the screen is blocked by a functionally useless HUD.

The only positive thing I can say is that the space environments would be beautiful except for the fact that 50% of the screen is blocked by a functionally useless HUD.  I can without a doubt say that this is the worst game I've ever had the pleasure of paying money for: 1. Textures inside the ship and station are not hi-res.2. Stations have one of about three different interiors.3. NPCs have about a dozen or so different model/textures need I mention the legions of old hags?4. Taking items from crates/lockers is fun for about 2 seconds.5. The only actual conversation option with NPCs involves persuading them that being racist vs Teladi is wrong.6. Hacking stations for trading is also fun for about 2 seconds no impact on story or universe.7. Movement of the main character walking into the  is nauseating.8. No variety: One ugly ship to fly the entire game. Very limited variety of "upgrades" (ie. Mk I Mk II Mk III etc.). Limited amount of weapons (5?)9. User interface for space trading is non-intuitive and confusing.10. NPCs repeat the same dialog "Show me your wares please" "These highways weren't here 40 years ago" "Shut up Betty" over and over and over. The list goes on but the bottom line is that the marketing campaign was an outright lie. This shell of a "game" is definitely not worth the price tag.,0,I bought X Rebirth hoping for a game to tide me over until Star Citizen came out and I totally regret the decision. I don't think I've ever seen a game less ready for release or so visually dated from first launch. (I'll contrast that with my lack of regret in buying the X-Superbox combination pack. Just so you know this all isn't just because I have no appreciation for the X-UniverseI bought X Rebirth hoping for a game to tide me over until Star Citizen came out and I totally regret the decision. I don't think I've ever seen a game less ready for release or so visually dated from first launch. (I'll contrast that with my lack of regret in buying the X-Superbox combination pack. Just so you know this all isn't just because I have no appreciation for the X-Universe games.) Okay so outer space is pretty and well rendered  but so was X3 Reunion (2005). However it looks to me like they're using the same nearly-unmodified rendering engine for Rebirth especially when you consider the appearance of NPCs. The first Mass Effect game (Unreal Engine) came out in 2008 and the characters in there look a hundred times more realistic than the six identical fugly NPC clones occupying all of X Rebirth's space stations. I can live with lousy voice acting but really these NPCs look like half-melted mannikin mutants who flap the lower halves of their aliasing-fractured faces in lieu of speech. To add insult to injury the awful station and NPC graphics apparently (at present) are so demanding people are reporting lousy framerates glitches and crashes. I'm managing okay but I have a very high-end system. More than a few people have found numerous XBox-specific configs in the game files lending further credence to the prevailing internet theories that X Rebirth was supposed to be released for the XBox 360 in 2007 or '08 failed to hit the mark and was shelved until quite recently. Then rushed to ship in a frenzy of marketing and misleading game trailers. Maybe they added a few tweaks (yet kept the Directx 9.0c also dated) did not bother to include joystick support (despite claiming such in their game manual) and made dozens of incredibly poor design decisions  such as forcing you to leave your ship and walk to NPCs to get them to sell you stuff. And making you fly all around station exteriors just to get prices. I guess the Powers That Be in the far distant future decided that convenient multi-product multi-vendor portals like Amazon were just too convenient  as are radios and the Internet. The future also appears to have lost such technology fundamentals such as ship radar usable 3D maps and heads-up displays. But hey what can one expect with crew members who look less realistic than characters from the Simpsons. I honestly can't believe this is a game released in 2013. It is SO not ready the gameplay design is full of totally inconvenient and immersion-breaking nonsense (really? I'm supposed to loot boxes and air-ducts?) and the non-space graphics are incredibly dated. Maybe after the bugs are patched and the modders get at it (as they have with previous X-Universe games) it'll become playable and bearable. But for now I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save your money and wait. I'm with reviewer Macscorner: I wish I'd instead just given the money to a homeless person. Even if they ran off and bought a bottle of vodka with it at least someone would have received pleasure from the purchase.,0,I really tried to play this game but had to give up after som hours but the game was realy playing against you. Sad to say but avoid this game at all cost !!,4,I reserved my review until a throrough play-through of the game trying to understand all the underlying mechanics and trying to understand how to play this game. I have finished the campaign (with the aid of mods) as well as I free-played for over 40hours  to see how far I can take it and waited for the patches to fix the most crucial game-breaking bugs that crippled the entire game andI reserved my review until a throrough play-through of the game trying to understand all the underlying mechanics and trying to understand how to play this game. I have finished the campaign (with the aid of mods) as well as I free-played for over 40hours  to see how far I can take it and waited for the patches to fix the most crucial game-breaking bugs that crippled the entire game and the plot.Unfortunately even with my hardest of trying I still can't give more than 4 out of 10 because it's not just the bugs. It's the design and features. I don't have to mention the  taking up 1/3 of the entire screen with no display of useful info beside my little HUD in the right corner 80% of the time saying "no signal".There is no useful map of any sort just sometimes the little HUD shows the zone map for a few seconds when I click on a highway symbol or space station. Probably another feature but bugged still.  I'm no version 1.21 and while the performance improved and a bunch of bugs killed the game is still a chore to play as well as the economy of the game dies off and ships will get stuck doing nothing  if you let the game run for several hours. The core feature of the game supposed to be the economy and yet it's dysfunctional to a point that you soon will realize that all the empire and space building you were planning all along (after the campaign or free play) may not going to work and you won't be able to pull it off unless you constantly cheat with a save game editor.  Regardless which sector or faction you are dealing with you will run into a problem of the producing space stations starving of resources and refuse to sell their products or perhaps their freighters will be stuck with a full load of products that cannot be sold and they will be idling in space.Other times you come back to a favorite station to buy a product only to realize that the loading dock or whatever attached to the space station is halfway destroyed. Not by enemy vessels but possibly just a ship getting stuck inside the station model and it desperately keeps ramming the station from the inside (of the 3D model)  and the game registers the bumps as weapon hits.  Another major crippling "design feature" is when you visit stations and scan the space factory the information regarding this factory and prices disappear after a few hours while you are in another system. How am I supposed to play a trading game if my contacts and product locations keep disappearing?See I'm not even gonna get into the bugs and the performance problems and the highway nuisances. I'm just mentioning the "design choices" how they are alone making the game unplayable.I just can't play this like that.  It's like playing a first person shooter game where your allies shoot you dead before you begin the campaign. Or your gun fires backwards or you stuck in crouch mode in a place where you supposed to be running. Or your top-view strategy game won't let you use a mouse.Whoever designed this game should really quit designing anything. His or her vision of what a playable game is just not sustainable and not desired by 99% of the people.,2,It has elements that showed potential but falls short the game might entertain you for a little bit but it's not worth getting and the game has a major problem with the graphics it take time for your surroundings to appear and sometimes even longer for the characters so my advise is to save your money for a better game.,1,Having been a big fan of the X franchise since X2 i was really looking forward to X Rebirth. Like so many others i was horrified when the game was finally released.

Egosoft have a reputation for releasing buggy games  and they do. But this was a new low. The game was in fact so buggy that it felt like playing a beta. That you paid full price for. Well lets list the Pros and Cons. Pros: - The game engine even if it is slightly buggy and have issues with high end hardware looks really great in space.- They introduced NPCs that you can hire to work for you. Like ship captains pilots etc. Good idea. Cons: - Game breaking bugs. Trade in the universe doesnt work the plot has several missions with issues. I could go on but trust me when i say its buggy and it wont be easily fixed anytime soon. Maybe 3-6 months down the road. Maybe.- Time sinks have been introduced. You have no SETA (which was an option to speed up time greatly in the previous X games) anymore. So its manually flying around taking "highways" with a pointless mini game to get your speed up. You have to land on stations and walk around to talk to NPCs that you need for the plot line as well as hiring new NPCs to work for you.- They removed the radar (gravidar)- The UI is even worse now than in previous X games- The way you have to order your ships around is mind numbingly broken and non existant.- You can only pilot 1 ship  and this is the ship you start in. I could go on but i think this will suffice for now. So in essence: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Egosoft have been making a fool of everyone that pre ordered. They are not to be trusted to actually fix this travesty of a game.,1,Crap game. Do not buy. A complete wash of money. Crap game.

If you have goods to sell you better make it easy to find. it is like a compartmentalized mall. If you want to trade that stuff you need to exit walk across the parking lot and you'll find a entrance behind the smelly dumpster. Any sensible station designer would make a single entry point i.e. a large hangar visible miles away.There is too many things in this game that does not make sense and I will not repeat them here as they have been mentioned by numberous other on both Steam and Egosofts own forums. Skip this and wait for Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen. If you can't wait. Buy or go back to one of the previous X-games. They are all very good to great.,0,This is just ridiculous.

Garbage throughout. This game should be the poster child for a mandatory no-question-asked 72 hour refund window for broken unfinished unplayable games.

It's buggy missions and tutoriels are sometimes unintuitive the AI flying the other ships of your squad is 80% of the time not working... Apart from all the things that might have been fixed with more development time I have to say that the game currently also have poor game design decisions. The whole 1st person thing the inability to be able to fly other ships poor overall ergonomy of the interface poor overall usability of trade interfaces. Also in my opinions the graphics haven't progressed from  the previous iteration of the X series they are dull they lack colors and overall they are just not pretty. Poor FX poor backgrounds... The game is still "fun" to discover when its not bugging but only because good space operas are lacking currently and it certainly does not deserve more than a 4/10. Not at this price.,0,I used to believe Egosoft made the X series as it is what THEY wanted to play.  It has never been perfect but i've loved it.  This game though was made for their grandchildren. 8 hours in awful design decisions mini games  and over simplification become the X legacy.  There are 4 different weapons.

They have all only reviewed X rebirth and have all given it a perfect score with a short blurb of text saying that everyone else is just "crazy" for saying it's bad. The amount of disappointment is monstrous. This is not only because this game is nowhere near what we were all hoping for (at most it can be called an early alpha) but also because Egosoft is not some big name studio with endless cash reserves. This colossal failure will spell the end of Egosoft and their space sims mark my words. Our last and best hope now lies with Star Citizen. Here's hoping....,0,needs more optimization  Indoor spaceship looks horrible  doesn't free look when you are in the  pit wtf  horrible controls  Do not waste your money pls,0,It has a lot of bugs and stutters.

Everyone suffers from being really terrible ugly.  Even selecting menu options with the Wireless Xbox 360 PC Gamepad is impossible as it will scroll twice for every one input skipping right over menu options making it impossible to even click on them without a mouse.  The tutorial will tell you the *wrong button controls* for the Xbox 360 gamepad! I feel like this is an alpha version of a game from five years ago.  I plan to give the developer a few months to patch things up before playing again.,1,Bought and played after patch 2.0. I really want to believe there's a good game here but there isn't. The entire game feels as though the developers had the best of intentions with the mechanics and game play but then never actually ended up playing the game they made or spending time in UX feedback.

There's no good answer only that they probably shipped an incomplete game. I was really hoping for a good space game but this isn't it. And now i'm very disappointed.,1,X-Rebirth. What a disaster. Where did it all go wrong? Who mistook innovation for bad game mechanics? Who thought it was a good idea to require you to land on stations and have to waste time hunting for dull npc's to engage with them in small-talk mini-games just so you can get a leg-up on getting good deals?

I never pre-ordered X-Rebirth or bought it due to the bad vibe that I was getting. I have played it extensively however recently on a friends computer and I have to say that all the negative reviews are generally spot-on. Does make me consider the mental health (or agenda) of any reviewer who can honestly give this game a rating above a 5... X-Rebirth was suppose to dress a lot of the issues present in the past series. So lets have a look at them. Interface: Did they address it? No! They've actually made it worse! What were they thinking? It also feels like it isn't even complete. There is no mission board so your left hunting literally for mission icons on stations to just pick up a job. AI Pathfinding/Auto-pilot: Even with the 2.0 patch lately the AI is still horrendous and simplified compared to the previous game. Map Size: I've often read on the forums of a poor defense argument when it comes to the map size. Some will say that while there is less sectors (only 4) they are a LOT bigger than your average sector. True. But an easy rebuttal is that if you combine just 8-10 sectors from the previous game you would come up with one whole sector and considering the previous game had around 199 sectors yeah... See my point? 4x10 is just 40 sectors! Course I've not gotten my measuring tape out but it's quite obvious that the map has been downsized. I'd imagine that will increase later on with paid DLC O YAY!... (Sarcasm) Graphics: Again another area in game development that has suffered strangely enough. You'd imagine this would be an area of development that would have improved but no! The shaders while the 2.0 patch has improved them slightly are still poor. Station interiors are horrendous. NPC's still look like plastic dolls. Stations themselves look like their made out of shiny plastic and the ship designs are well crap... Player Mechanics: Ah yes a topic that has been discussed to death on the forums prior and post release. Egosoft did their best in trying to PR this disaster in stating that the restriction on player ships would no way hamper gameplay instead we would have drones to make up for it! Err... Yay? Egosoft made some excuses prior to release that such a limitation was there because THEY decided that it be more fun that way. That's right they figured it wasn't fun to fly other ships and instead more fun to fly just the one! Yes Bernd did state as such on the forums. Now we know they were just trying to coddle us. With the arrival of the 2.0 patch or as I call it X-Rebirth 1.00 there has been some bug fixing interface improvements and general across the board touch-ups. But regardless of any future 3.0 4.0 5.0 patches I can't see them fixing the core of the game which is a shoddy mess of design. No matter how many patches/dlc is released X-Rebirth will still be X-Rebirth at the end of the day and that's a bad thing. I love the X-Series. X3TC is by far my favorite (along with some mods) so I had high hopes for X-Rebirth despite my misgivings about the 1-ship deal. Unfortunately X-Rebirth is one of those rare games in which there is nothing in it that I can honestly say I like. That's an achievement for someone like myself who loved the series.,0,Garbage. I've played ALL the previous games in the series i have a few hundred hours in X1 and X2 and a few THOUSAND in X3 X3 AP and X3 TC in this game I have a little over 20 and I am already **** sick of all the **** boring gameplay console interface clunky controls and horrible bugs it has. Avoid at all costs I wish I could get my 60 euros back and get into Elite Dangerous Beta instead.,0,Instead of a review I'll write my experience with this game. I've waited a half year to try this because Egosoft usually takes this long to get a new X game running. I was eager to try my new Saitek X52 Pro on this one.First I went into options like with any PC game to set some graphical stuff. I found the resolution was set to 1280 which was very odd so I set it to my native resInstead of a review I'll write my experience with this game. I've waited a half year to try this because Egosoft usually takes this long to get a new X game running. I was eager to try my new Saitek X52 Pro on this one. First I went into options like with any PC game to set some graphical stuff. I found the resolution was set to 1280 which was very odd so I set it to my native res (usually done automatically in PC games first fears of Consolitis surfaced in me). I read on the net that the "story" mode is a big tutorial so I went with that to get ready for free play.The first thing I saw was this polygon puppet that is supposed to be a woman. It looks exactly like a 3D woman looked.... back in the year 2000. I'm not exaggerating here! The character animations are on the same level and look like a mixture of zombies and robots.The game is (supposedly) not about character interaction though so I thought and just ignored that and went on to fly.... ... or not.The entire Joystick keybinds were completely messed up. Like this game was made for a (inferior) console and not for the PC gaming master race. So there was some Consolitis in the game. I didn't even know they released this game for a console. A space sim... really? They are MADE for PC's.I accepted that too though it started to bug me... Anyway I went on to configure the joystick so that it was able to actually fly forward (strafe up/down; left/right were set as default instead of pitch and jaw) and use some of the functions that were unbound or bound to strange keys (autopilot map dock targeting). I still had to choose menu options with the mouse and run around with kb+mouse setup. Strangely there were highlighted button names like they appear on game pads (A)... hmmm...I was kinda pissed at this time but I still hoped the game was at least bug free stable and that the free play mode later would offer some fun. After one hour I was ready to fly. Yippee! A big universe awaits!First mission: target practice! The game tutorial told me the highlighted stuff was showing me where to go. This was nice the only downside was that there was no highlighted stuff. It also told me it would display the distance - but it didn't display anything not even my flight speed.While I was still trying to get that display of normal HUD info up and running which is to be expected in every space sim game since the most early ones I suddenly lost all control of not only the ship but also the HOTAS the mouse and the keyboard too. The ship was now drifting towards some asteroids...So I half heartedly tried to solve this next obstacle... I even tabbed out of the game and tried to go back but couldn't as it was "Not Responding". Well okay then I'll not respond to it either.0 points for this epic wanna be space sim fail.Deleted. TL/DR:Wow! After a half year this game is buggier than the alpha version of Star Citizen - Arena Commander it surpasses all games I know in terms of unplayability and the character models and animations were directly sent here from 14 years in the past. In short: Consolitis severe alpha bugs stay away at all costs!This game will never reach the state X2-The Threat had better go with that game!,0,even after patch 3.53 the game is crap. still no economic system still the same station to walk at every station still a stupid autopilot ( remember me of X3 TC autopilot do the same crap and crash you into stations ^^) this game is still only a space shooter with a tiny element of random Price history tradingsystem.X games had 4 foundations of gameplay: "trade fight buildeven after patch 3.53 the game is crap. still no economic system still the same station to walk at every station still a stupid autopilot ( remember me of X3 TC autopilot do the same crap and crash you into stations ^^) this game is still only a space shooter with a tiny element of random Price history tradingsystem.X games had 4 foundations of gameplay: "trade fight build think".

While this game shows some potential it has significant technical problems. Campaign has some bugged scripts and overall performance is awful even on fast computers. Poorly implemented user interface doesn't help too. Wait for several months before trying this one.,4,There are a lot of mixed emotions about this game.

For those gamers this product fell well below the standards they were expecting from EgoSoft after playing other X series games. I won't give it a 0 but 4 is fairly accurate in it's current state  in my opinion of course.,4,It would've been better if they stuck to some of the old and trusted ways of doing things but they're trying something new and are obviously a smaller team of developers and thus things don't always work out.  They decided to listen to feedback from the previous games and a lot of that feedback has found its way into this game. The things that bother me the most at the moment after 5It would've been better if they stuck to some of the old and trusted ways of doing things but they're trying something new and are obviously a smaller team of developers and thus things don't always work out.  They decided to listen to feedback from the previous games and a lot of that feedback has found its way into this game. The things that bother me the most at the moment after 5 hours of playing are the UI and walking around on stations.  The latter is a nice feature that a lot of people wanted but it's not implemented well.  Plus the interactions only get better the more you drink...  beverages of an alcoholic nature .And returning to your ship I don't understand the constant need of your co-pilot to show off her cleavage. The UI is just disgraceful but again a lot of feedback regarding the earlier complexity moved the developers towards a silly console like approach.  This is sad... as well as the already mentioned lack of keyboard shortcuts and what not.  Getting around in the game at the moment is still very frustrating. As of yet I don't have the X feeling with this game.  I find it to be a different game.  It's not horrible but it certainly isn't good.... yet.  The developers will fix things with time but as the team is small it will take a bit of time.,1,You know I have been looking forward to this release for some time and now I can't make my self play it anymore.  I have been playing the X series for many years even before I started my steam account  But this X Rebirth was so bad that I don't think it can even be patched up or fixed with DLC's it should be scraped and never let out again or rework the whole game. guess I'll go back to X3AP,1,This is an absolutely terrible game. As in really bad. The 2.0 update doesn't really fix it instead I found it even less playable. If you get a free copy and your time is worth nothing then this is probably a game to pick up. Otherwise you are better off staring at your bedroom walls. The only reason I give it one point is that there is still Garry's Incident.,0,It's been two years since this game was released.

The only reason game companies can release crap like this is because you idiots keep pre purchasing their games! They already have your money so they can release junk and there is nothing you can do about it! STOP!,3,Despite having been released over a year ago and receiving many patches the game still severely underperforms on high-end hardware and does not have compelling gameplay. Expect to spend 80% of your play time flying back and forth through transparent space tubes 10% flying around space stations within 10 meters of the hull to scan information points and giving trade orders to your shipsDespite having been released over a year ago and receiving many patches the game still severely underperforms on high-end hardware and does not have compelling gameplay. Expect to spend 80% of your play time flying back and forth through transparent space tubes 10% flying around space stations within 10 meters of the hull to scan information points and giving trade orders to your ships and the last 10% pew-pewing spaceships with one weapon at a time. Here are some of the game's shortcomings: * Boring gameplay consisting mostly of flying through space tubes as if you're playing some sort of public transit passenger simulator rather than a space game.* Vastly fewer weapon options with no ability to fire multiple weapons simulatenously.* You can only pilot one ship unlike previous games where you had hundreds of choices in many ship categories from scouts to carriers to freighters.* All objects in space are inexplicably surrounded by protective bubbles that absorb all damage from collisions making the few precious moments spent outside space tubes even less exciting.* A lot of tasks needlessly require the player's presence such as chauffeuring ship officers from stations to the ships where they are to work.* When talking to NPCs you must wait for them to finish talking before your commands take effect given the fact that a particular zone may have dozens of NPCs of the same type offering their services this makes finding specific goods very annoying.* You are forced to use a cockpit wasting 30% of your screen on what is essentially a static model with some flashing lights here and there. A discreet HUD overlaid on an unobstructed view of space would be vastly superior for many players.* The draw distance is depressing with objects conspicuously popping in as you travel inside space tubes.* The 4 different sectors are basically palette swaps of each other with a few cosmetic differences (a cracked planet here some space debris there etc).* The script and voiceovers quite obviously weren't done by native speakers resulting in strange and immersion-breaking dialogue and pronunciation.* Character models and station interiors are very low-quality.* The Teladi look like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. This would be funny if it weren't so tragic.* Your co-pilot's jumpsuit has an embarrassing boob window that betrays a lack of respect for the playerbase. The game does feature a few improvements however they hardly justify all its shortcomings: * Capital ship components can be damaged individually adding depth to capital ship combat.* More piracy options now you can not only extort and salvage enemy ships but also hack them to release cargo.* Station complexes now exist as superstructures rather than individual stations connected by spaghetti strands.,3,This game is in beta right now despite the claim that it is in v 1.12.

Large ships have immense problems navigating stations often moving directly through them or simply spinning in circles aimlessly. Missions cannot be completed because AI bugs out and can't find its destination (in Trade or in Escort missions). Of course these things can be fixed as the game continues but what probably won't be fixed is the terrible voice acting. Not since the 1990's influx of hastily-translated Japanese games have I heard voice acting so poor. Your co-pilot seems to be voiced by a woman who simply read each word in the dictionary once (which the editors cobbled together to vaguely form sentences). There's a lot of potential here the stations are intricate and interesting the graphics are beautiful transportation is actually interesting for once and the battles can be epic and fun but the major bugs and poor voice acting make the game in its current state unplayable.,0,Worst X Game EVER. Laggy on a high end specs PC. Interface is a shame all station are same looking inside from a sector to an other.

It is indeed impossible to play it without comparing it against some of the older entries in the series. The command functionality has been reduced to the point of obscurity. Remote control of ships is impossible as is all forms of total automation. The minigames are repetitive and boring  and worse impossible to skip. The stations interiors are all identical. The list goes on but it is sufficient to say that the game mechanics are broken. The campaign is not immune to the problems. If you do decide to purchase this "game" make sure to save often and in different slots. As it is currently impossible to remove orders from freighters invalid orders will cause your freighters to sit there and do nothing  making the campaign impossible to continue. Without time compression damaged engines will make flying back to a station a chore. It pains me to admit  I regret buying this title. Furthermore the realization that this is the direction Egosoft seems to be taking their series both saddens and makes me worry for their future. Hopefully this debacle will remind them of their games strengths. I'll shelve the game for now. Maybe after a year or two of further development it will be worth playing. For now skip this.,0,I have too many negative things to say about this game to be honest. Lets start with the actual concepts and mechanics in the game(the ones that atleast work). So a few years back i wrote plenty of suggestions in the Rebirth forum about this game. One suggestion I made was even featured in an interview with Bernd. This was essentially what I had asked about. "Will there be anyI have too many negative things to say about this game to be honest. Lets start with the actual concepts and mechanics in the game(the ones that atleast work). So a few years back i wrote plenty of suggestions in the Rebirth forum about this game. One suggestion I made was even featured in an interview with Bernd. This was essentially what I had asked about. "Will there be any functionality or ways to have the player build his/her own empire like fleets/ stations and essentially almost have a player controlled faction?" Bernd had replied yes that there will be large fleets the player can create and he can also customize each ship and station. Well guess what? I cant even tell 1 ship to go buy something. The features that the dev had said himself would be in this game are non existent. Now thats fine just give me an expanded version of Terran Conflict so I can make lemonade out of lemons. Too bad thats gone too This is an entirely different game folks Your stuck with a ship that has the most pathetic name of all time and you can pick 1 out of 4 weapons to fire away with. You also cant have a ship patrol an area it can only follow you or go mine some rocks. As for stations well now you have to work extra hard to find a trader or an officer or someone who sells a specific drone. I don't bother with looking at ship types because they all look the same to me. The plot is boring broken and hasn't remotely interested me since i saw the first databurst in the game explaining the setting and whats changed. Lets not forget the amount of bugs and performance issues i have on high end custom built PC. I had better performance playing Rome 2 maxxed out on release day than this game. This is not XRebirth nor will it ever be. Its also not a rebirth its the final nail in the coffin of this series.,3,The X series is known for its cruel learning curves and some what daunting scale It's lure of big ships and tycoon station building It's wow graphics and even its un-forgiveness.

However If these are the things you love about the series its time to mourn in the wake of the newly released X:rebirth. Its flawed yet stunning graphics keep you captivated as you negate smashed planets debris and beautiful super space cities. The much improved ship physics and travel make space battles more invigorating even jump gates seem to make so much more sense as you look back a million miles away from where you just came. But as you play more the games seems just that extra light year away. Us PC gamers are hardened to bugs glitches and crashes But sadly X: Rebirth almost drowns you in them. Your only allowed to fly the one ship your given and buying a new ship feels like getting a new Lamborghini and then only being allowed to watch your friend race it around the block. characters are repetitive and creepy looking however its forgivable seeing as its a space sim and not a FPS. Ship traffic shows a dynamic living world however stalking them for good trade routes reveal that they are lost or just enjoy going in circles. walking around on stations just feel unproductive and unnecessary. The game barely keeps my attention for more then 4 hours and didn't ruin my social life as i hoped for in the next 2 weeks. Sadly Egosoft have become very much like that dad who is trying to fit in with the younger generation with its new looks and faster pace but it try's so hard that it trips on its own complexity. Im going to crack out X:3 and help remind my self why I love Egosoft.,0,The biggest disappointment ever. I'm was a massiv fan of X-BTF X2 X3 but this game are a crap unplayable console game on PC. My big mistake i bought the Collectors Edition.,1,I per ordered this game and waited this long to write a review. I gave EGOSOFT plenty of time to offer something as a way of compensating those who bought an unusable game and had to wait for updates. and we got nothing. So this game gets the lowest score i can give. I'll even come back and change my score if EGOSOFT starts to compensate for the broken game.,0,I've put 10+ hours into this.  I've put A LOT more into X3 games.  They have killed the excellent UI and game mechanics that made X work.  The new gameplay is horrible  being limited to flying one ship is a deal breaker.

It is a major pain to do anything anymore and I can't imagine being able to build the kind of "empire" that I had built in X3.  So far the game is more like Darkstar One instead of an X game.  OH and they're also hiring PS/XBOX programmers right now so its clear where their priority is.  One more game franchise that is being dumbed down for consoles period.

I initially rated it a 3 and now I'm giving it a solid 7. The learning curve is large.The highways have more traffic than is logical.The voice and in-game humor is rough.Can only seem to fly one ship.

(though you can own many fleets of ships) There are other things I could point out. Thankfully however they're not game-breaking problems. Typically they're all things which upset the level of immersion a game like this reaches for. I've put 7 or 8 hours into a new campaign run and I'm quite addicted to playing the game much like I was addicted to the previous X games. This campaign strikes me as better than the previous X games so far. For all those who bought the game and were sorely disappointed now seems like a good time to try it out again. For me the game left a large stink in my memory. I didn't look forward to redoing much of the campaign that I struggled/hacked the game to get through. Once I started though I had a lot of fun.,3,I loved X games always so I've pre-ordered it. The disappointment was so big i was fighting steam and ego to give back my money. finally the did. now after one and a half year of patching Egosoft decided to give a free weekend so i thought to give them an other chance. played 17 hours in 2 days. Some would say it already worth £10 as entertainment but it was more of just suffering. itsI loved X games always so I've pre-ordered it.

Avoid it in any cost.,2,I have also been waiting for a long time for a REALISTIC IMMERSIVE space sim that actually makes you feel like you are in a believable futuristic space world. That means DEVS There is no air in space. Which means ships have no max speed only max acceleration and burn time.  Sure you can use ship computers to limit max speeds during combat or in certain areas.

That means DEVS There is no air in space. Which means ships have no max speed only max acceleration and burn time.  Sure you can use ship computers to limit max speeds during combat or in certain areas.  With that being said why do ships in this game have to use these Disney like monorail highway systems.  Can't ships just travel the old fashioned way  with the use of their own engines?  I thought the accelerator gates in the terran systems where ridiculous. This is worse.Another very important part of a space sim is the detail and functionality of your ship. All of the parts should work and the  should be completely realistic and functional  not what the 'skunk' has which is just simple eye candy garbage.The final most important thing in space are something that is always forgotten.  It is what we live on Planets.  When considering a new space sim I always ask a couple of simple questions.  First  can I interact with planets? Like something so simple as orbiting them or landing on them.  Egosoft has always ignored planets as with most other space sims. Except for freelancer  which is 10 years old. I thought X rebirth might fix this.  I think not again they are completely inaccessible pictures in the background. Another thing I ask is when I look at that nebula in the background can I actually get there. In this game there is no real way to get there because the ships are slower than a modern day airliner.  Again just background pictures that mean nothing  immersion breaking.The performance issues of this game are truly bad and there is so much unrealistic space junk floating around I just get a headache.Here Is my final prayer for a distant wish or dream of a realistic believable space sim not Mario brothers in space for a console. Please please Star Citizen save me!!!,1,Where can i startThe game has so many problemsIf anyone played X3 TCyou would know that it was a proper pc gamewith X rebirth it was defo designed for Xbox and PS3The graphics are good but the preformance is terrible and i do have a fast machine.Saying that the new beta patch adds alot of things but still it is a turd.Never ever again will i pre-order a game.I bought the CE of theWhere can i startThe game has so many problemsIf anyone played X3 TCyou would know that it was a proper pc gamewith X rebirth it was defo designed for Xbox and PS3The graphics are good but the preformance is terrible and i do have a fast machine.Saying that the new beta patch adds alot of things but still it is a turd.Never ever again will i pre-order a game.I bought the CE of the game for 65 euro and i should have just thrown that money in the fire.Guys take my advise stay away from X rebirthMaybe in a year or so it might be a small bit better.,0,X Rebirth? More like X Stillbirth. This isn't a game it's a waste of your money. Technically the game is horrid grinding to 10-15fps on high end machines. Gameplay-wise the game is horrid with early 2000's style wooden npcs and horrific off-ship play. Did I mention the bugs?

Dock on stations get out of your ship walk around the hanger and then take a stroll through the station.  It is very impressive. However due to the performance issues I cannot give a high score as of now.  The game really is unplayable at 10-15 fps in fights on a machine that handles most current games superbly.,5,I can't even play the game. Every time whether I select 'Free Mode' or Campaign it just hangs at 100% loaded and then has a 'Crucial error'. While I can't speak much about the game to warrant a lower score it has certainly disappointed so far.,5,Another case of "trying to appeal to a broader audience". A rough gem perhaps much more rougher than previous X titles ever was. Instead of making the game more accessible and try to get you even more immersed in the universe they add additional layers which feel like a chore and also are redundant. The UI is a step backwards in my opinion and that's something if you've playedAnother case of "trying to appeal to a broader audience".

X Rebirth could be just the right one for many gamers specially when the modders get to work with it. However this game got released with so many bugs and so many problems that it shouldn't be released at all. This is a real issue this game can be great but it got a lot of negative reviews now that won't go away that easily. A stupid mistake that should not have been made by Egosoft. Postpone the release of the game if it has so many bugs this just isn't right...,7,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Hello all Gamemaster1...here! Now before you go all crazy I will be giving "Pros" and "Cons" of X Rebirth.Lets start with the Pro's: The detail is fantastic! Not just the cool backdrop of planets or the blown up celestial rocks that used to be planets or the distant nebulae floating in vibrant colors. I'm talking about pulling up to the factories and watching the belts of rocks going into the foundaries to be melted down or the jungle sounds to include running water when you pull your ship over the growing greenery. Police ships scanning for contraband and eletrical sparks emmitting from solar panels. Inside the stations you'll find a mini -game arcade of "Beyond the Frontier"(unplayable but cool eye candy)Also if you pay attention you can see shuttles/elevators going back in forth/up & down as to drop off workers to their apartments watching energy cells being charged up ready for shipping and crane operators moving large containers...etc.So much attention to detail went into the planning of the universe. You can dock with your freighters and capital ships or catch a ride near any "big boy" by flying close enough to get sucked in by the ships massive gravity wellif I may. If you don't feel like fighting battles dock with your ship and stretch your legs and watch the battle from within the docking bay...brilliant added feature. When you do feel frisky you can target different components of capitals or freighters such as the shield generators rear engines jump drive(so they can't run from your wrath of firepower).The ability to stop at a station for some "coffee and donuts"(not actually in game) and chit-chat with a number of interesting space folk. Hire some Engineers(to fix your war torn vessel)Managers(to keep track of stations operations) Defence Officers(to protect your assets during battles) Marine Officers(to keep your marines in line during boarding raids) Captains(to fly your newly captured ships)...just to name a few! Thats sooo cool!While on board the stations you can look for loot in vents lockers boxes and in various places. And sell them to the Black Market dudes(if it's illegalwink wink) If you like to dance(not actually possible yet) go to the dance clubs and grove to flickering strobe lights and watch hot holographic dancers shake their money maker!...Whoop Whoop!(i'm not a perv honest).While fying your newly found craft sitting next to a hot stowaway(just kiddingyou rescue her in beginning) you can discover many hidden cache's of wares(i found 70k and more) in deep space using your scanning mode. The storyline takes you from a slacker "jack of all trades" to a wanted crimminal fighting against an Opressor Plutarch Mining Company! My list of good goes on and on. Now for the Cons: Some of the coding is unrefined. Which in most case causes you to restart or load a previous saved game.(they have since patched up to 1.24 which fixes a mess of coding deficiancies) Some of the previous X games added "Fleet control" which is lacking in X Rebirth. A major downer for me since i'm OCD and like to have all my ducks in a row eating what I tell it to and bitting who I command( the duck's are actually ships folks...jeez)And the all too often mentioned "Grandma UI"...is hard to look at scarred face(Al Pacino style...lol) short hair and rude to boot.(but thats expected from space fairing peeps) The UI are pretty much stationary except for an occassional girl walking back and forth. And the maintenance guy welding things.The lack of movement in your cockpit(you can move around in the back of your ship). There are no buttons to push in front of you for added realism. The poor support for your joysticks. Limited field of view in front of you and no head movement(mouse free look for the lay person...lol). I like to win battles but the fighting/battle worthiness is too easy and the enemies are predictable with only a few moves under their belt.I wish their was a more detailed sector map that showed containers from battles won...over all their is a long list of just basic content that would make the game more fluid and enjoyable(they are working on bugs and then adding more content later from what I gather.,7,As of update 2.50 Rebirth has improved quite a bit (Have over 100 hours of game time) from the original mess of release. I have found the game to function quite good and most areas of the game work as intended.

With the Xpac around the corner (free to owners of Rebirth as long as you grab it prior to end of Nov 14) I think Rebirth will be in pretty good order but taking additional 12 months to make it playable was bad for Egosoft and the players. Many left and most likely will not return. Can only give Rebirth 7/10 as there is a ways to go yet til its worth scoring any higher. But Egosoft does look as though they are pushing hard to get Rebirth to where it should of been at release.,6,I never played the other X games and this is my first review on this site. I only played 2 hours due to low fps and getting stuck while exploring stations and having to restart(due to no auto-save featuref5 is your friend). My first impression with the game was the extremely low FPS(Between 15-40) I don't run a NASA setup but I've always been able to get my games running at 60 fps onI never played the other X games and this is my first review on this site. I only played 2 hours due to low fps and getting stuck while exploring stations and having to restart(due to no auto-save featuref5 is your friend). My first impression with the game was the extremely low FPS(Between 15-40) I don't run a NASA setup but I've always been able to get my games running at 60 fps on 1920x1080 resolution with tweaking. Changing the graphics options such as resolution and AA had no difference on framerate. The voice acting I encountered was dull and uninspired. I don't want to do a bigger review right now because I havent been able to play and judge the game properly.  But my first impression is that the game is very badly optimized and would clearly of needed more work. My rig: i5 2500k  3.3ghz8gig RAMGeforce GTX 770Windows 7 64bit,5,This is my first X game and when I saw few videos on youtube about this game I got really excited.

I preordered this. Things:-Framerate is low not unplayable but low (i7 95012 GB GTX480).**** is nice and seeing things like trade routes from the screen what pops up in the ship is cool and gives nice immersion that I really am on that ship.-When I'm flying  could have more little screens like one for the target ship info map communication... There is unused space for that atm.-Interface on communication is bad. To be more precise its console game bad and its slow & hard to use. Why? If there is over 12 possibilities to choose from WHY. THE. F. I can see only 5 at the time?!! It could be just 12 rows and even game pad user could see all possibilities and choose from those fast. Not by pressing "show more..." and wait for slow menu reappering. Very bad desing.-As a newb I could really use more info about everything. Oh its not a mechanic that repairs your ship I wonder what it is (answer: engineer). I had and still have to google very much. Civilization 4 had excellent hyperlink system what showed Civilopedia about the thing player was wondering. There is Encylopedia on the game but it could be much better.-On campaing/tutorial people speak same time as info text shows on the screen so player doesnt remember either. There are no conversation logs or info text log. Good that missions have little briefing text to Missions screen.-Trading is hard. Or actually probably not cause bugs just didnt let you trade. It might be better now after trading patch. I havent tried cause new bugs came with that patch.-I like the thing that trade doesnt happen instantly and you have to wait ship to arrive and actually transfer stuff with space station.-I like moving on the stations on first person camera but stealing stuff feels little silly. Framerate on the stations is bad too and stations are all the same. I understand that and its not big problem. Game isnt very bad just released too early with bugs. I'm sure bugs gets fixed but at the same time I want to get back to space to trade fight mine and all but I cant cause the game doesnt work!With better UI and bug free I could give this 9/10. As high as 9 because this is first game like this that I play veterans of X serie probably give less.,5,This is my review I did of X Rebirth on my review site http://tiger-gaming.org There has been a lot of hype surrounding the release of this game and Egosoft has put a lot of time into creating such a game.  After all with the huge success of X3 and the X series in general there is a lot to live up to.  However no one can argue that the X games are complicated beasts.  Advanced fleetThis is my review I did of X Rebirth on my review site http://tiger-gaming.org There has been a lot of hype surrounding the release of this game and Egosoft has put a lot of time into creating such a game.  After all with the huge success of X3 and the X series in general there is a lot to live up to.  However no one can argue that the X games are complicated beasts.  Advanced fleet management combat trading networks etc.   Egosoft needed to “re think” and re design the game in a way to not lose the complexity but to simplify the learning curve to allow more people to become fans of this very deep and complicated world they created.  Well this has back fired!  Is that a terrible thing I don’t think so.  The complexity is still there.  It is just hidden behind somewhat inefficient menus and interfaces.  But don’t think for a second this is the end far from it. X-Rebirth is a game that Egosoft has been working on for the past 7 years and the amount of time and effort put into this game shows.  Sure the models for some NPCs aren't the best and the dialogue can be a little cheesy but the real impressive feat is the dynamic living Universe they made.  You are just simply a squirrel trying to get a nut in this huge Universe.  Of course that doesn't mean you can’t make a name for yourself quite the opposite…  You are free to do anything at all.  You can be a space pirate and pillage any space craft you see you can be a large scale trade tycoon making Millions or be the best military combat pilot there is!  It’s all up to you and X Rebirth will let you do it all at least that is what the plan was. The game so far for many people has been a let down.  There are problems with random crashing performance issues bad dialogue and poor voice acting just to name a few.  I was really excited for this game and wanted to build up a huge trading empire and eventually build my own space stations.  I haven't been successful so far either due to crashing being stuck in the campaign or just plain frustration. But for all that is bad and disappointing about this game there is a silver lining.  Egosoft is very dedicated to the fans and surprisingly they have been very supportive with the community and expressed sincere apologies for the issues players are having.  I applaud them for doing that.  Also they have been busy working around the clock investigating the issues with X Rebirth and are truly listening to the feedback from the game community. There is great potential for this game.  After having problems with the campaign mode I decided to give the "Free Play" mode a try.  And in this mode it worked quite well.  Exploring the Universe that Egosoft created can be breath taking.  It is quite large and very well done.  You'll find space stations merchant ships mining vessels and more just out there doing their thing.  It's all fully controlled by AI. Another aspect of the game that does work well is Combat.  I had some fun while going after raiders.  I am terrible at combat in these kinds of games but I still had some fun.  It's especially nice to blow a ship up that is just getting on your nerves.  And after gaining some credits  currency  you can upgrade your ship and that makes flying and combat even better. As for my recommendation for this game it's a tough one.  Sure X Rebirth is not without problems and I am sure you can read about many peoples experiences on the forums and community but I like to believe there is still hope for X and so far the developers have shown me that this is true.  If you are an X fan then I say buy the game for sure.  You know best that the X games have their share of problems on release but they also have excellent developers and the games become truly great products.  If you are new to the X Universe you may want to wait for a major patch update or a sale.  But I still would suggest that you don't write this game off as a failure.,5,I never heard of this series before (dunno how I missed it) till' I saw this on Steam.  The last game I played like this was Freelancer and boy was that long ago. I did some research on the series heard great things and jumped on it.  I wanted to give you my quick impressions from someone completely new to the series.I knew it was gonna be a little daunting going in  but itI never heard of this series before (dunno how I missed it) till' I saw this on Steam.  The last game I played like this was Freelancer and boy was that long ago. I did some research on the series heard great things and jumped on it.  I wanted to give you my quick impressions from someone completely new to the series. I knew it was gonna be a little daunting going in  but it wasn't as user-friendly as they made it out to be.  I read they got rid of a lot of the menus which sounded great but..ya...I'll get back to that. When I first loaded it up  there was a giant ship fighting a nearby station.  It was awesome and looked straight out of a movie.  Half a dozen fighters were engaged with it and most of the time I was just idling doing slow barrel-rolls trying to figure out the controls but it was still epic. Once I got my bearings (and was right-side up) I wanted to start getting to know my ship its weapons shields etc.  So I start clicking the display screens...nothing happens I start clicking everywhere else still nothing.  I did however end up shooting the nearby station and they told me that wasn't very nice. After about an hour I still felt lost. Each station I visited though looking nice just seemed like big cluster f*s.  I assumed there'd be a shipyard somewhere but I only ever found the docking bay for the bar thanks to the giant holographic martini glass.  I eventually found some traders after doing some hunting in the station. I started getting impatient with the lack of info interface and sluggy fps and eventually quit.  I didn't give up there though I heard so many good things and I really wanted to like it so I went back and got X3: TC and the difference was night and day. The UI was the first thing I noticed and it was glorious.  It had buttons! And those 'evil menus' that had INFORMATION.  It had maps weapon details and history all without having to swivel around in my chair to look at some lady who's staring at me who should be making sure we don't crash into anything while I'm squinting my eyes trying to read the information holograph. Once again I felt lost but it was more a feeling of being a new kid on the block in a vast universe.  I felt I had a stronger hold and understanding of my ship right from the get-go (thanks to the easily accessible menus and info) and I spent most my time just exploring and meeting the different races and seeing the massive war ships and different divided stations that I might one day obtain.  In Rebirth I felt lost in my own ship bashing the console and listening to the lady yell at the computer. Right now I'm enjoying X3:TC way more for a fraction of the price. If this was meant to bring in people new to the series I guess it kinda worked but I just ended up going to an older game.,9,EgoSoft you've come a long way with this.

But that's enough to knock one point off a perfect ten. This is an incredibly ambitious game as the rest of the X series is known to be.  It's huge beautiful and complex.  And now that it's playable I love it.,6,We all waited and what did we get? A console game.  Were is the joystick and keyboard control? It is a brave attempt and they do support their games but I worry that the flaws will not be able to be repaired.,10,After patch 2.0 game runs with no problems . Trading galactic map and some minor bugs still need some work but this game in my opinion should get second chance from players who loved X series. Okay driving one ship only might be problem for many ppl who played X2 and x3 . But hey that's for patches  are for.,3,It's not the perfect game i hoped at least not right now but it's good nevertheless. I know they will listen to their customers and i also put faith in the modding community so i can accommodate this game to my personal taste put so far it's "good".The thing that is bugging me a little is that they insisted very much in the "immersion" but that part the crew management walkingIt's not the perfect game i hoped at least not right now but it's good nevertheless. I know they will listen to their customers and i also put faith in the modding community so i can accommodate this game to my personal taste put so far it's "good". The thing that is bugging me a little is that they insisted very much in the "immersion" but that part the crew management walking in the stations talking with pnj that part was really poorly executed  boring for me way too repetitive and the voice actor... The flying part is very enjoyable. I can't recommend to buy this game full price if you are not a "fan" but i don't feel robbed so far because after some hours i know i have only scratched the surface.,5,I am an X fan boy been following the series since XBTF. I was on the first X forum before they closed it and started the one we see today. So I am not a hater nor I am blind to the games problems. Fact is after 30 hours playing the game I found the plot game to be either broken generally buggy or requiring work arounds to just to advice.

So I am not a hater nor I am blind to the games problems. Fact is after 30 hours playing the game I found the plot game to be either broken generally buggy or requiring work arounds to just to advice. Your playing around the bugs basically which is frustrating. The none plot game only works properly for the early stages there are bugs or missing features that are needed for the mid and late games to work. So what we have here is a basic fly around trading shooting and doing missions game. This will keep you entertained for about 30 hours before it becomes boring. I must warn you that the tutorial it self fails to explain anything. For example it says dock at station Blar blar using menu 2-2 but fails to tell you want menu 2-2 is. The tutorial assumes you know how to play X Rebirth already. Turns out what is needed is this. Fly to within 200m of the dock click on the docks icon and then press F. No menu required. That example is the first experience people have of X Rebirth it took me 6 hours to work out how to dock... Is it any wonder people give it zero scores.,5,If you thought Alien:Colonial Marines and Skyrim were too polished then this is the game for you. It does not only contain hundreds of bugs AI who don't have a clue what they are doing Shoddy interior textures and NPCs who you just want to punch after hearing the same line for the hundredth time it also contains Mini-Games and not just the ones intended by Egosoft! Egosoft have goneIf you thought Alien:Colonial Marines and Skyrim were too polished then this is the game for you. It does not only contain hundreds of bugs AI who don't have a clue what they are doing Shoddy interior textures and NPCs who you just want to punch after hearing the same line for the hundredth time it also contains Mini-Games and not just the ones intended by Egosoft! Egosoft have gone back to basics with this title chucking out silly combat concepts like the ship radar out the window and if you don't think being unable to track a target well isn't difficult enough enemy AI has now been told to ONLY shoot the player this logic sometimes extends to your own ships. Don't be surprised if your shot in the back while the only ship around is your own and a following vessel (I like to think it's a joker captain who I quickly fire and replace). This does allow for you to practice maneuvering skills kind of like a game of Deadly Dodge-Ball which can make Fleet fights extremely interesting since every ship can end up just shooting the player or alternatively all Hostile ships shooting the player with Friendly ships having a smoko break. You will also have hours and hours of enjoyment baby sitting your empire not only are your ships almost entirely incapable of defending themselves they will usually go out of their way to follow you even when you don't want them to! Also Egosoft has deemed the need of simple AI commands like Move To Dock At Follow Me Escort Target as unnecessary. Trade ships even one up this by spending 30-40 minutes heading towards a deal you've set up due to explicitly jumping to a sector no where near the deal location and sometimes completely ignore you! Feel like trading yourself? Don't worry Egosoft won't make you jump through the hoops of setting up deals and buying goods. You instead get to Dock on stations and take all the goods like any good Easter-Egg-Hunt and station authorities don't give a damn! Now would be a good time to mention the NPCs more specifically your co-pilot Yisha is extremely helpful spouting lines like "Shut up Betty!". You better get used to her looks as you'll be seeing her a lot so much so that Egosoft deemed it necessary for some eye candy. As for other NPCs their English is extremely poor and can only comprehend simple lines like "Show me your wares please!" or "Show me your skills!" you'll fall in love with these two lines as you'll be hearing them very very often. One more thing I should mention in the X universe... for some reason has a very VERY large population of Elderly woman who sound like they are in their 20s/30s. In all seriousness though I give the game a 5.,7,The game star bad but now in 2.0 the game it's really good! Many of many bugs it's solved many new features e optimizations. Gameplay it's good but can be better.,5,a week into this game and it still glitchy as hell...poor form developersterrible framerate terrible voice acting HORRID NPCs crashes often bugs galore!  (can't for instance tell your ships to even "stop" or "go")  NOT worth your,6,I have played this game for 7 hours and overall i think it's a good game that needs a couple of patches doing.

They do... There are small differences from station to station but nothing that'd you'd be able to look at and go "Oh there is such a thing i must be in such a system"However in the 7 hours i have played i can't say i haven't had any good moments.I give it a six but if they patched the optimization i definitely think it could be a 7 or an 8.Needless to say I'll be playing it for some time still it does immerse me and i must say i think it's one of those games (especially for new players to the x series like me) it will take some time to understand how everything works.,5,There's alot of release bugs right now.  I would seriously hold off buying until the majority of them are sorted out.  Egosoft is notorious for fixing bugs so wait a while and check on people's impressions then.,5,After several days of tweaking settings I was able to play this game. That' says allot right there. I rated each section out of 3 1/3 and then added them up. Graphics(1):The graphics are a rather odd mix. The character models look like those from games made a decade ago.

The character models look like those from games made a decade ago. The ships however are lovely.

The voice acting is passable but almost seems like "developer voice acting" at times. It is however consistent with previous X versions. Gameplay (2)The gameplay is good but still lacks polish. Some of these issues may be due to the horrible frame rates. That gives X Rebirth a 5 out of 10,5,This game is slowly improving with each successive patch but the odds of it having a rebirth of it's own in the eyes of the critics and haters are next to none If you are reading this when the patch number gets to about 1.6 then perhaps give it a go it may have all the bugs fixed by then but this game is effectively dead in the eyes of the gaming community.,10,I loved the game since launch and the new version 2.0 releasing soon is amazing.  I'm playing the betarc9 release and it's awesome:  new cockpits new graphics new gameplay etc.,10,I started playing with version 3.53 and i must say this game is really good. Tons of things to do nice story and great atmosphere. 40 hours of playtime is nothing.If you like space games like privateer freelancer etc you will not be disappointed.,6,Game is not bad but feels rushed and unfinished it is like a Beta version.

Of course i feel disappointed as I was expecting better from this game but it is not that bad as some people say in here (probably with some patches it will become way better),10,Here i am 7 months after the... "Released"... And 7 months that the game is over patched... And i must say congrats to Ego. They failed but they've learnt and they 've listenned to the rest of the community. X Rebirth 2.00 will be released end of May and trust me it's the good occasion to test it again. Go back to your new cockpitS !,9,This kind of review is only for the whom have something to relate to the original game...

If you want something faster play Pac Man (the original not on a computer),10,casual gamers will not like this game the meta rating of 33 is a disgrace for this rating system if this is not ur type of game dont rate it. people who are into space trading/fighting/story get negative influence when they see this rating. sure this game is not perfect and yes i am a huge fan of space sims. i played this game like 20 hours and i say compared to other games in thiscasual gamers will not like this game the meta rating of 33 is a disgrace for this rating system if this is not ur type of game dont rate it. people who are into space trading/fighting/story get negative influence when they see this rating. sure this game is not perfect and yes i am a huge fan of space sims. i played this game like 20 hours and i say compared to other games in this genre (and there are not very much) its a really decent game u can put lots of time without getting bored into this game. exploring and making money for upgrading ur ship is very challenging. i give this game a score of 10 cause of the metacriticism is very low but really if u compare it to other games who are simular its still a 9+ game. i did buy it and will but the next if the evolving in game and graphics are like this game :),7,I'm reviewing this because I think it's unfortunate that the old critic reviews are based on the game play before patch 3.10 and new reviewers are spending so little time before reviewing such a big game. So I've decided to review the game and and give my impressions.It's true what others say this game is much different in that unlike other X games where you could pilot different shipsI'm reviewing this because I think it's unfortunate that the old critic reviews are based on the game play before patch 3.10 and new reviewers are spending so little time before reviewing such a big game. So I've decided to review the game and and give my impressions.It's true what others say this game is much different in that unlike other X games where you could pilot different ships and enter space in a suit you are now limited to one ship and instead of floating in space you now dock at stations and walk around trading with and hiring people. Doing the campaign is a good way to learn about the functions in X:Rebirth and there are A LOT of things to do in this game. You do need a decent gaming laptop or a desktop to play the game and have it look good. I thought my laptop was good until I tried playing this game on full details :x but relatively high still works fine and the game does looks awesome. Unfortunately the game is lacking when it comes to things like customizing your ship and there are many design quirks that make some things arduous like needing to restock fuel cells. Thankfully some of the more tedious functions in this game can be circumvented by player made mods. Buying the game on steam is especially useful for their point and click mod installations. Another bad thing is the price.It is a big game but it's not for everyone so knowing if it's for you is important. I got it during a steam sale and have played 44 hours so far apparently... but that steam counter is shifty ¬_¬ This game like other X games are for people who have a lot of time for space. Sure you can go off doing missions for factions bounty hunting patrolling ect. that stuff doesn't take long and neither does getting the credits to upgrade your ship the way you want it. But when you want to settle down and build a station or factory or start trading or mining it takes lots of time. In closing I bought the game because I liked X3:AP and the story of the X Universe and because it was on sale. I would recommend it for fans of X series but caution to newcomers who don't know what to expect. Also after playing a bit without them; get mods.,6,The game is good in general. Nice gameplay cool atmosphere but when it comes to the graphics... The UI is bad. It's not just bad it's horrible. The letters on dialog menus are unreadable controlls with mouse&keyboard; are very uncomfortable.Performance is really low as well. My specs are a bit higher than recommended but I still get just around 30-40 fps on low settings.So overallThe game is good in general.

My specs are a bit higher than recommended but I still get just around 30-40 fps on low settings.So overall the game is good however needs some more work.,5,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        I've played this game for over 10 hours so far.  I've played some of the previous X games and this is far different.  In some ways this reminds me of the C&C; series.  They went a completely different direction on C&C; 4 then they did on the previous titles.  C&C; 4 had some of the elements of the previous titles but changed a large amount of the core features that people liked and expected.  X rebirth went the same way.  You have way less control then you did in previous games. I find the graphics to be great with some lag spikes.  The dialouge is what you would expect from the X series.  I"ve done well in learning anc controlling the previous games but I'm finding myself lost in some of the basic features I would expect out of this game.  No auto target or target hotkey you must click on the target to select it.  Can't change ships (knew this from the start so was expecting this).  No autopilot or SETA(time speed up). One of the biggest problems is the UI.  It would work good on a console but it is not PC friendly. Having to go 5 levels deep in a radial menu just to say you are looking for a particular is clucking and time consuming.  PC's can support many more options and could get this done in 1 or 2 levels. I'm also trying to figure out how to find and order ships around.  As far as I can tell they will only do something if they are in small fleet with yourself.  In previous titles you were able to create fleets and assign orders to them Defend Ship/Station/Location etc.... Also the ability to land and go walking through a station is both good and bad.  There's a few different station load outs with some nice eyecandy but there is a bit of repetition( to be expected to an extent).  Having to run around and find merchants and such is fun at first but becomes tedious.  The older games you could just dock and pull up a trade menu.  I'm kind of split on whether this is good or bad. The combat in the game is enjoyable with some exceptions.  That exception is being stuck on the same ship with the same abilities.  It is very fun taking out the different components of a capital ship.  Taking out the turrets to stop them shooting taking out the engines and such is a fun addition.  You don't have to beat a ship down to nothing to stop them from shooting.  You can selectively target what you want to shoot. The map is horrible in this game.  The layout was easy to understand in the previous games but this one I have yet to figure completely out.  It would have been nice if they combined the best aspects of the last games map in with this one but that is not the case. This game as a lot of potential but it still has many issues that need to be worked out before I would call it a success.  It will take time for the bugs to be squashed and new features to be added but once that is done it might be a very fun game for most.,5,X Rebirth or X Farewell? If you have read even a single review thus far then you are probably fully aware of the god awful character design and voice acting the expansive variety of only TWO lifeless interior spaces the plethora of bugs and performance issues the broken gimmicky console UI which doesn't scale to resolutions higher than 720p the lack of proper joystick andX Rebirth or X Farewell? If you have read even a single review thus far then you are probably fully aware of the god awful character design and voice acting the expansive variety of only TWO lifeless interior spaces the plethora of bugs and performance issues the broken gimmicky console UI which doesn't scale to resolutions higher than 720p the lack of proper joystick and keyboard/mouse controls and large array of other bizarre design choices and blunders. Despite these problems I can't stop playing it. Here's why: - Flying around in space is GORGEOUS. DX11/DX9 who cares...It looks incredible. Load the Better  and Sweet Rebirth FX mods from Nexusmods and it's even better. - Don't like landing and exploring one of two interior spaces for the 1000th time to find a trader? No problem load up the NESA mod and be done with it; you can then contact them over comms when nearby without docking. While you are at it you can disable the pointless voice acting chatter with the Shut Up mod. - Piloting and combat are fun. I would prefer to use my HOTAS joystick but the Xbox controller works well enough if you are comfortable using one. However this is only for control of the ship; the UI is a mess regardless of which control scheme you are using. I wouldn't recommend playing at all if you don't have or want to use an Xbox controller until they build in proper support for joysticks and keyboard/mouse. -Mods mods mods. There aren't many available yet since the game has been out less than a week but in time the modders will turn this into an entirely different game. There are already some very useful mods available. Conclusion: If it weren't for the fantastic scenery fun combat and mod support; this game would be a spectacular 7 year dud. With mod support there is hope for the future of this game at least until the end of 2014. Egosoft should have stuck with what they do best which is certainly not characters and interior spaces on a console. If you can't do it well then you shouldn't do it at all. Modders have quickly chopped those awful bits out of the game so that the rest of us can more easily enjoy what Egosoft does do well; beautiful space vistas ships and stations. If you are on the fence of buying this I recommend watching YouTube videos of gameplay before purchasing since there are no proper reviews out yet. The decision I must make each time that I want to play X Rebirth is whether or not I'd rather be sitting in the  of my F7C-S Hornet Ghost enjoying the static view of my lonely hanger in all its glorious detail. I doubt it will be a very tough decision next month when the dog fighting module is released and I'm cleared for takeoff. That's when I'll say farewell to the X Universe. For now X Rebirth is certainly not worth $50 but I am enjoying aspects of playing it so I cannot in good conscience give it a negative score below a mixed 5.,7,Revised my score to 3.  No longer have confidence they can pull this one off.. even with patches and mods.  The map system is unusable the bugs are too numerous to count and there's no easy way to manage my trade fleet.

It has plenty of depth and gameplay. Adding the Teladi trading post as well as numerous updates including cockpit configurations and automations (new trading software) for player owned shipsthis game is slowly becoming what it wanted to be over a year ago.The campaign is still hard but playable. I haven't had a crash since playing (over 20 hrs now)   but playing the freelancer /sandbox game is more rewarding.You can build your space stations and build up your fleet. It's gonna take a while but with the new software upgrades of the player ship the trade stations previously discovered do not disappear from the trading menu.Fights are so-so although it can be fun since there are now rare items which can be crafted after finding all the parts (random drops from enemy ships) and either sold for a lot of money or used as a trading tool to gain more reputation.I have to give my praise to Egosoft for not letting this game die and hopefully more people will try it and find out that it isn't bad at all as the review sites make it out to be. Those are the first reviews from 2013 but ever since then the game has been seriously overhauled and the developers continue to patch it on even now.,5,I guess you've already read about all the bugs and design flaws. All those reports are true but I think there is so much potential and I just hope that the developers will get this game up and running soon.,5,A great looking space game that needs lots of tlc some serious re thinking and more time baking in the oven. Could be really great one day if the current issues are taken seriously.,5,This is my preliminary observation after the first few hours of play. Seven years to develop a game designed to play on the PC with controller but no joystick support?! Documentation is poor. These are basic necessities in any flight sim game. Even games 20 years older had better stick support.

I'll continue to play this game over the weekend to see if it convinces me otherwise. Thus far I have not experienced any game breaking issues as other have posted here.,7,I'd give it something closer to a 9 if there weren't so many bugs.  But I don't think the bugs warrant downgrading it lower than that.  Given the scope of the game and the small size of the company that made it bugs at release are to be expected unfortunately.  That said there are a lot of bugs and they are very frustrating.  But as far as I can tell the major bugs (capital ships notI'd give it something closer to a 9 if there weren't so many bugs.  But I don't think the bugs warrant downgrading it lower than that.  Given the scope of the game and the small size of the company that made it bugs at release are to be expected unfortunately.  That said there are a lot of bugs and they are very frustrating.  But as far as I can tell the major bugs (capital ships not repairing trade ships getting stuck in infinite loops unable to complete a trade) are all in the AI scripts and not in the core engine and hence fixable.  There is a solid and clean engine here that plays great if you avoid the issues that are still buggy which is unfortunately the AI scripting for trade and fleet management. The scope of the zones is massive and the graphics are excellent.  Being able to walk around on the ships is gimicky but does add to immersion and is easy to get through once you understand the comms interface.  Space flight mechanics are solid and maneuvering your ship in dog fights while dodging between structures in the massive "space cities" is a fun.  Exploring while I do that will keep me entertained while EgoSoft hammers out the scripting bugs with the other mechanics. The bugs are disappointing and a little more glaring than I expected but EgoSoft has a history of hurdles like this on release and always hammers through and delivers.  I would suggest people probably wait a bit before picking it up if they haven't the patience for dealing with the glitches that are there now.,10,It is now September 2014 an in Beta 2.50 the game is great and basically at the state it should have released. Go check it out if you have it patch it up. Also there is free DLC you can grab on Steam (free until November 1). I´d give it an 8 now but as this game has so many trash reviews I´ll rate it a 10),10,With the new patches being release plus the mods that adds even more fixes this game can really make your day.Giving it a 10 to add a positive mix on the score.,8,Not the game it was on release.

It's not so bad releasing a problem bit of software if you're dedicated to fixing it. I find the graphics astounding in game and sound effects quite good too. I'd say the game has a large learning curve and it's not surprising that the game experiences some problems now and again considering just how many aspects of the game there are. One other thing that scores points with me is that the forum is friendly and productive and that includes the moderators and developers who also positively work together in diagnosing and fixing problems etc. The only thing that could stand to be improved is that once you're rich there's not much for you to accomplish in the open ended game.  You can build massive fleets but it's not like there's any enemy that can fight these massive fleets of yours and it's not like you can go on a conquest.,10,X rebirth has gone through some major changes that have brought this universe from glitchy twitchy to an Extremely immersive envoirement. I've very much enjoyed my gameplay since Teladi Outpost the fact that they release a free dlc with that many improvement is awesome. I'm looking forward to a new storyline or several to choose from to further shape the universe with causes and effects.,10,Just play 3-5 hours before posting a comment  Some people here don't realy understand that X-rebirth is a HUUUGE game with a HUUUGE tutorial and need time to be domesticated. I put 10 to increase the general rate. Objectively for now  8... But 9 or 10 once bug ll be fixed!,6,As someone new to the X series I bought this based off the hype that had been building up for weeks.

Egosoft has released a buggy game with poor out of box performance that has incredible potential now that it may be turned over to extended development and the modding community that will surely fix NPCs multiple ships custom menus etc. Other than poor performance in the few hours I've played so far I really see no reason to call for the developers' heads and demand refunds although Yisha yelling at the computer to shut-up every 5 minutes is rather vexatious.,7,Wait for the 2.0 patch in a few months :PThe game is ok in some parts  Epic in others ..but tragically bad in some basic parts ... Its like they add stuff in the last few months and did not had time to fix them :(The game will be so much different in 6+ months :D,6,Somewhat clunky interface bad mouse controls. Trading is rather limited. Though smaller than a typical X universe it has much better space feel.Exploration is pretty big part of the game if that's your thing. A game which will easily sink hundreds of hours if you can bear with it.,10,Everyone looking for the right review look here.

You can follow the story line but go off on your own whenever you so choose to and still be able to return to it at anytime. You start out with a basic ship and through many various ways of collecting wealth via trading mining policing mercenary missions requests stock market pirating station building resource producing etc you make modifications to your command ship with bigger weapons modules armors engines but also be able to purchase traders fighters war ships even giant battleships with a variety of weapons that can be used simultaneously. The game has its own economy that runs by itself with AI ships stations corporations that in each game in unique and diverse so no two games are alike. Based on the chooses and actions will change the world and behavior around you. The larger you emase your empire the more fierce your competitors and enemies become. Highly recommend this game to all who love beautiful sci-fi graphics amazing 3-D space action and economy trading and empire building strategy games.,10,Every new game has its flaws and bugs.

So I decided to take action fixed my graphics card (HINT HINT) made sure my integrated graphics wasn't messing with my gaming GPU and whoa. Everything graphic wise was fixed next I made sure there were no viruses on my computer that can impact the game like saving and actually installing the game. Yeah that was one problem that didn't allow me to save and possibly what caused most crashes during the game. Next I reinstall the game and I was enjoying the thrill of a space sim. Complex trade routes nice joy rides through highways capturing "Plutarch" ships building space stations and don't forget about those millions of credits from missions. :) All in all the game is great for folks who take care of their computer and enjoy the game like pros.,7,So I am one hour into the game and it's concept is very nice I think.

The captain and crew all stand around the landing bay sometimes crouching over and over again...Hard to find mission logs (if it even exists). Some instructions pop up on the screen but if you miss them you can't find them again...Sometimes the little display that pops up to the right of the pilot (looks really cool) doesn't respond to mouse clicks. I have figure out a reason for it or what causes it.Changing graphics settings leads to the game crashing (for me anyway). But the settings appear to be changed when I reload the game.NO AUTO SAVE (that I'm aware of)NPC models are pretty lackluster facial expressions are weak I don't care about it much but it's not a positive,9,Can not stop playing this game.

I can not tell that form EA or Sega who do just collect a lot of money and leave a bad game behind.So for that I give Egosoft some credit and I like the way XR is going. It is a good time for me as a space fan. I am playing XR ED X3 XRM and X3 LU. Only I had more time to spent.  :) bad start but a beautiful game it is know.,9,I have been a fan of the X series for years and gave this game a score of 9 because that is what it rates.

My system is mid range for the high end systems category and the graphics are very smooth at max settings. The space station exteriors a very detailed and the zone back drops are graphically very appealing.  I have had no problems in free play mode but haven't gotten very far with over 50 hours of time on it. The station interiors are small appear be rushed and the NPCs lack appealing qualities. The problem with this game that is cited by most people giving this game a low rating is the campaign.  There are scripting issues that need repair.  The developers are working very hard to fix those issues.With the scope and detail of the mechanics of this game look very complex from a software programming standpoint which is the fixes are coming slowly. Many people have reported having to modify the software to get unlimited wealth and fix issues they have found.  I personally don't recommend this because it can induce other problems that is not the fault of the developers. Although with the problems at release this game is a very well done space simulation and trading game.  I feel it is well worth the price and expect to spend 100s of hours of entertainment.,10,With all the new patches this game surely is showing all its potential what it will become! Give Egosoft some time and we'll have ourselves a nice space sim! Great job with the patches ego! I'm having a blast!,8,Purchased the game on launch day and couldn't help but read the negative barrage on here and the Steam forums.

Yep a few...while I haven't had a CTD I have had a case where game wouldn't accept any commands and I was stuck in between options and forced to restart the game. Frame rate was addressed in one of hte two patches as with both of my gaming rigs (i5 with 660TI SLI and i5 with 7970) I dont dip below 35 FPS with all options cranked. Game is definitely a departure from previous X Titles. So far I like it...are the NPC models as bad as people have made out? Yes...they are dire...outdone in levels of direness only by the horrible give your co workers a voice over gig voice overs :( HOWEVER the sandbox feeling is intact...the graphics when in your  and flying around which let's face it will be the majority of time are excellent.  Controls are straightforward with my XBOX controller and  I have been able to start without much trouble unlike in previous X entries. While it isn't likely much can be done about the voice overs (I just use subs and have voice volume off) I am confident they can address most of the other issues. Going to go back in game now...my personal experience scoring below: Gameplay  8/10Graphics  7/10Controls  9/10Sandbox rating  10/10Audio  5/10 Overall rating 8/10,7,I have 40 ish hours in this game and I love it so far but It is currently a diamond in the rough. The game has many bugs and it is hit or miss if they effect your game. I was lucky enough to have very few bugs and I have progressed pretty far into the storyline. Which is actually halfway decent especially if you consider the story in past games.

Which is actually halfway decent especially if you consider the story in past games. I would recommend playing the storyline and not free play until you finish the story. This game has a different feel to it then previous games and the storyline helps you get a handle on the game. The combat in this game is amazing. The AI can be kinda buggy but again Egosoft will iron it out but when it does work the combat is very exciting. I have seen fighter drone fly in formation a couple of time and they unexpectedly wrecked me. The capital ships combat is by far the best part of the combat The capital ships have targetable components such as turrets engines etc. You can not simple sit in place or strafe you have to be constantly moving to avoid the turrets and drones. The combat is hit or miss though sometime the AI refuses to work but when it does it makes the game quite challenging. Given time Egosoft will fix the AI. At first I hated the UI I was using a keyboard and mouse and found the lack of shortcuts quite frustrating I also own a gamepad and once I gave in and switched over to it the UI became easier and made more sense. Switching to a gamepad made the game 10x more enjoyable. The UI still needs work though with information buried away but I am sure EgoSoft will fix this as well and will add more shortcuts. The graphic are beautiful no matter what some people say. The game does only use DX9 but it doesn't seem to hurt it at all. You can tell they spent a lot of time making the universe look good. The main complaint I have is that the inside of ships and stations need work it is a lot of copy and paste. and the character models are  interesting  (there is only old shemales with 20 yr. old girls voices in space apparently). Overall the the graphic are quite nice. The trade is very different from previous games which has upset many people no longer can you set up a ship to automatically make trades for you know you have to tell it which trades to make. The trading is kinda buggy at the moment with some trade ships not completing there trades. I again was lucky enough not to have this issue and set up several trades that worked. The trade system has great potential but is bogged down with sloppy UI once they fix the UI and give you some more command feature trading will be more engaging which I think was the goal. I also played around with mining and the ship work very well with me mining and also on its own filling up its inventory with ore on its own. Overall trading does need some work but is has potential and needs some empire management interface added but it has potential of that empire building feel once you adjust to the changes. The game is great but you have to put sometime into it before you can see it's potential. Once Egosoft fixes the bugs they will start to add feature like they have done for every single one of their games I am sure given time this game will be the best in the series. If you have not purchased the game yet I would recommend waiting until some of the bugs are ironed out. Storyline: 7Combat: 9UI/Controls: 4 (6 if you switch to gamepad)Graphic: 8Gameplay: 6Total:Estimated gameplay time: 1000+ hours,10,This is by far the best game I've ever played in its genre.

The community expected this to be a stable version right off the bat but it was horribly bugged. I think that if they called it BETA they would at least set the expectation lower for some people and a whole lot of people would wait until the BETA turned into a very stable release (3.0+) before buying it and getting disappointed. This would have given it a much better rating. Why did I vote 10 for this game? I got in at just the right time when 3.0 + DLC Teladi Outpost was released. Also I haven't played the last X games so I come from a fresh perspective not expecting this to be a sequel but a brand new game. Egosoft rocks. Why you say? Well they had one of two options after releasing the "BETA" product. With the whole community getting pissed off Egosoft could have just discontinued development and abandoned this game OR and this is the option they chose to continue development until every bit of what they promised came to fruition. This screams loyalty to all fans and I will continue buying Egosoft games now and forever.,7,I am really disappointed in all of you.

That is not to say this game has its faults the bugs do kind of kill it and the game does seem mainstreamed. The devs tried a new idea and so far its average so why are you condemning them? To say this game is the end all of the series is just an exaggeration that you created to make you sound cool. So shut up hipsters go play outside or something if it angers you this much read a book be somebody who behaves like a decent human being.,8,Although it does have some bugs and general issues to work out the game is beautiful and shows a vast and endless amount of possibilities with a bit of modding like all X games. It's not perfect but no game ever is despite what people claim. Personally I like how they did things and i believe that this game has potential with a few months of bug fixing.,7,X-Birth is a pleasant surprise for me a first-time player.  No it's certainly not perfect: its UI and Engine need a lot more polish and a better training mode would be great.  i.e. it needs a patch or two.

The game's gentle speed and occasional action are great for night-owl OCD play.  I gather it's not what long-time series fans were expecting  but not liking a game because it wasn't a fanboy-wet-dream come true is laughably adolescent. It has made we want to try the previous X games. Anyhow if you're tired of MMO raids killing everyone in Los Santos of shooting  in post-Apocalyptic Soviet subways or finding another humming Nirn Root in Riverwood  give this a try.,10,No entiendo como le dan a este juego una nota tan baja es verdad que tiene fallos como bugs y tal pero irán actualizándolos con parches no olvidemos que juegos como Battlefield 4 han sido nefastos en su lanzamiento y han ido mejorándolo con actualizaciones y le otorgan un 9 .¿Que deberían lanzarlos ya pulidos?¡¡¡pues si!!!

Como fan de juegos de temática espacial que soy encuentro el juego precioso hasta el punto que a veces me dedico a pasear entre las estaciones es bastante más intuitivo que sus predecesores cosa que agradezco por que hasta que medio dominé el x3 terminé un poco desesperado .El juego rezuma vida por todos lados y el nuevo diseño de estaciones y naves lo encuentro muy acertado y me gusta la idea de controlar mi flota desde mi nave principal.En mi opinión cuando el juego este pulido será una obra de arte que para mi ya lo es pero en fin como gustos hay colores.,8,Game runs without any problems. interiors look nice the universe and space stations look astonishing.Controls are okay better with gamepad. But this is not surprising. I mean you operate a spaceship! This isn't something you do normally with mouse and keyboard.The new things like highways and space cities serve the game well and the universe looks really vivid.For all usersGame runs without any problems. interiors look nice the universe and space stations look astonishing.Controls are okay better with gamepad. But this is not surprising. I mean you operate a spaceship!

And they promised to fix anything as soon as possible.,9,Coming from a long time fan of the X series this game blew me out of the water the same way that reunion did. Egosoft managed to increase the scale of just about everything in the game. The ships are bigger the stations are gigantic and what really drew me in was the attention to the little details. The long lines of ships that you see moving through the stations are all actual NPC'sComing from a long time fan of the X series this game blew me out of the water the same way that reunion did. Egosoft managed to increase the scale of just about everything in the game. The ships are bigger the stations are gigantic and what really drew me in was the attention to the little details. The long lines of ships that you see moving through the stations are all actual NPC's that live and breath and can be interacted with. The way you can see the local law enforcement conducting scans and blowing away any wrongdoers does so much to immerse the player. The updated interface does a lot to present the player with all the information they need without obstructing the view of the action. Combat feels very fluid and the ships handle like a dream.  Sure the character models and the voice acting are well pretty terrible. but thats not what the X series is about. From Beyond the Frontier X has always been about space thats what egosoft knows best and they really showed it in Rebirth.Haters of this game can just continue to cry and piss their pants. Yes it has bugs but lets be honest what X game didn't launch with bugs? Reunion was  almost unplayable for the first month of its release and that turned into a fantastic game. Things can really only get better from here on out and I look forward to whatever egosoft brings our way.,9,X universe becomes even more complex but (surprisely!) even more interesting and enjoyable. UI could disappoint you at first but you'll find it easy and intuitive after some hours of usage.There are some issues with total stability but after week or two they will be fixed.Good luck Egosoft! I'll recommend X:Rebirth definitely to all fans of sci-fi genre.,8,After seeing all the very low zero's in the user reviews I just wanted to write my own review to show a more realistic rating on this game. I've played for about 5 hours now and it's not a superb game but it's also not bad I would give it a 7.5 but because of the fact it must have a 7 or an 8 and with all the extemely low ratings so far I'm going with an 8 for a bit of a balance :)After seeing all the very low zero's in the user reviews I just wanted to write my own review to show a more realistic rating on this game. I've played for about 5 hours now and it's not a superb game but it's also not bad I would give it a 7.5 but because of the fact it must have a 7 or an 8 and with all the extemely low ratings so far I'm going with an 8 for a bit of a balance :) Graphics 8/10In space everything is just gorgeous and full of detail and I'm not even running on the highest settings since my pc is already  a couple of years old. Inside the stations it is pretty oke but just not up to the standards set by the space enviroments. The biggest problem that ruins the submersion into the game are the animations of the characters spend some more time on them and it would help a lot. Controles 8/10 (For controller use)I have connected my xbox controller and using that the most right now. At first the response of the right stick was WAY to high but after some tweaking that was fixed. It took a little bit of getting used to the several controls in the beginning and walking around is still a little bit awkward. But all in all I have no problems with it. But I have not spend a lot of time on the mouse and keyboard yet and since a lot of problems I read on here are about the keyboard and mouse controls my score might be a big higher User Interface 7/10The user interface has indeed been streamlined and although a lot of people are complaining about the new menu I think it all just a matter of getting used to it. Of course it is different from the old games and ofcourse that means you can't find everything right away. But that was the same thing when you jumped into X3 as a new player to the series. In fact for me this is already easier than the old X3 menus where. Gameplay 6/10So far the only real pain in my butt while playing the campaign is that fact that you must search for the right entry into a space station and then have to look around for the right persion (took me a long time to find a drones sales(wo)man). I rather not spend unneccesary time looking for people inside the space station when the outside is so much more beautifull to be in. ConclusionThe game has a lot of potential and is off to a great start just spend a bit more time on the animations and looks of all the characters we have to spend time with and try to think of a faster method of finding the right person for a job and the game would already improve a lot.,9,I do not face any serious bugs so far within the game running version 1.12. I absolutely love the immersion and the game itself. However the menus and the performance need to be improved I certainly agree on that.,8,Sure this game was released too soon. But the devs are working hard to fix it and they just released 1.18 patch in beta version. To install it check the description in egosoft forums. The complete version of this patch will most likely be available very soon. Well I don't know what they did but everything works fine with this new version. Everything runs smoothly at max res (noSure this game was released too soon. But the devs are working hard to fix it and they just released 1.18 patch in beta version. To install it check the description in egosoft forums. The complete version of this patch will most likely be available very soon. Well I don't know what they did but everything works fine with this new version. Everything runs smoothly at max res (no more fps drops in Shady Vault for instance) the trading system isn't "bugged" anymore as it seems (freighters no longer stop for no particular reason) there are now plenty of drones in stock to equip your capitals in all shipyards (you just couldn't find any in freeplay mode in 1.17: trading was just impossible you had to build your drone facility first) no more crashes... I can't believe it but they actually did it: 1.18 is almost bug free in its beta state. Concerning the gameplay well I don't understand all those angry rants... Maybe these raging guys just had no clue about what X games are all about and expected Freelancer or Elite... Maybe they expected an easy start to understand all the game mechanics within the first hour of gameplay... I don't know. Why all this rage? Seriously:- Trading in X Rebirth is actually the same thing as in previous Xgames. The only difference is you need a crew instead of softwares to control your ships remotely. You need to give orders to your crew but you can do it from anywhere so I don't understand why people hate so much the new system. Maybe it's that because you need to dock in stations in order to find crew members first; I must admit the inside of the stations are pretty dull and npcs are indeed hideous but that's it. But when you're in space... it's just breathtaking. And you're in space 98% of the time. Docking in station just adds a little more immersion. It isn't well done but it's not important at all. Not to mention they already planned to add better textures and facial animations.- Combat is way better that previous X games; I don't get why people say it's "awkward". To navigate mouse control is indeed horrible but hey! It's a space sim dammit! Just grab your stick :D Boarding big capital ships is intense. And explosions are gorgeous  Yes it's a show. But it's damn fun.- I've heard/read a LOT of  about joystick compatibility: the game IS compatible with sticks! You just can't bind all keys for most sophisticated sticks and may experience problems to navigate in menus but who cares seriously? just switch to keyboard/mouse for your menus.- The new building system (station building) is really improved. But again those who spit on a such a behemoth of a game after only 2-3 hours of gameplay don't have a clue about it. You guys are really ridiculous.- The UI is far from being perfect but they already started to improve it in 1.18 version. Menus are sometimes unintuitive but Egosoft already said the whole thing will be more readable more intuitive very soon. And actually I already got used to it; just make some efforts put more time into it and you will as well. Btw gravidar is coming soon as well. For now I've almost finished my first station in freemode my Fedhelms are mining automatically and they're not bugging when I ask them to sell what they just gathered my scaldis is responding and operationnal I haven't any fps problems in Shady Vault freighters seem to actually trade without any issue cargo drones aren't buggy either... Great work and thanks for this 1.18 patch guys. Forget about all these dishonest and lazy reviews coming from guys who haven't put more that 2 hours in the game a freaking X game which needs at least 10 hours just to understand its mechanics. Forget about all that crap and keep up the good work. I know you gonna improve the game with new content maybe new mission types special missions given by smugglers in bars bounty hunter market and famous pirates to find in hidden fortified station deep space exploration anomalies... idk. For now 1.18 is stable just needs a few details to fix and it will be great. For those who are hesitating I just wanted to add this: it's an X game. The more you play it the more complex and interesting it gets.,8,Playing X Rebirth 3.0 beta and some part of the coming DLC The Teladi Outpost I must say Egosoft did a great effort to save this game after there bad release.The game is a game now and it is great and fun.

ED is also great but hasn't as much features as XR.X rebirth 2.5 was already good but XR 3.0 will be even better.I am happy that Egosoft not leave this game and keep updating it till it is finish. Great game,7,X Rebirth is a game that requires a lot of time investment.

But you still have to really want it to make it happen. P.S.

About the complaints about the fly only one ship HELLO I don't want to have more than one ship to fly. One is quite enough if it is done right. The design decision to walk around in spacestations was a great idea but badly executed (not that bad but it could definitively have been better). All I have written is more to the truth than nearly all other "reviews" here. Should you buy this game? Maybe because it's not because of this game but because and this applys to all games I'm against paying for games that's broken and games that rips off the consumer in some way. Otherwise it's a nice game and I'm going to enjoy it many many hours yet.,7,Firstly the cons the game feels glitchy in places and at times it's hard to follow and the story line which can sometimes be a bit vague in how to complete a quest. However the campaign itself is a huge improvement over previous games which I have to applaud them for. Game play (for me) isn't hindered by the current bugs which makes the game itself mostly very enjoyable to play.

However if you're looking for a polished game then I would recommend waiting a couple of months possibly a Christmas present to yourself ;) I'm optimistic about this games future as Egosoft have a reputation of huge updates with include both bug fixes AND extra content (for free!!). Personally I don't find the bugs too much of an issue right now however I could understand why others might be a little unimpressed with what feels like a potentially great game that has been released prematurely.,7,This game COULD be great and as the community (or even better the developers) works on some polish I think it will be much better. Absolutely beautiful universe that is ripe for some good X gameplay the problem is too much missing from the X. Marry this with all the good things from X3 and it would be great.

I really hope that through DLC and modding that it will stand up better to its predecessors.,9,I write... I to play the old games like Elite Wing Commander or Privateer.

Some time later and hard work from Egosoft's part we have a much improved 3.0 version. Apart from a lot of stability performance and bug fixing work much needed features and functions like a proper command and control system interface overhauls camera views proper station building and many other stuff has been added. I have played the game on release and after the first few patches lost complete faith in it and left it to pick up dust. Now I have returned to give it another go after a long time and what I found is a fine game worth playing. It is actually a pity the review cycle of this game cannot be rerun. I'm sure the game will receive much better ratings from players in the state it is in now. Egosoft has made a big mistake with the botched release but they have stuck with it and did a brilliant job at fixing it up. If you want the best mix between Freelancer Darkstar One and X3 then this game is for you.,8,i changed my mind i think it *can* be of use played and probably it will get improved by user feedbackNPC atm weak saves crashing (it will be fixed very fast i think)  actual gameplay is okbefore i gave 0 but seriously rage is not good point so now 8 for look concept opportunities,8,So many hateful reviews I've played X Beyond the Frontier it was a great game but after playing X2 The Threat I started to lose interest. X Rebirth is an entirely different game a breath of fresh air where every action you make affects the universe around you with infinite possible outcomes. It's focused on trading and missions and you have the opportunity to build a small empire.So many hateful reviews I've played X Beyond the Frontier it was a great game but after playing X2 The Threat I started to lose interest. X Rebirth is an entirely different game a breath of fresh air where every action you make affects the universe around you with infinite possible outcomes. It's focused on trading and missions and you have the opportunity to build a small empire. I have the graphics maxed out and the game runs perfectly smooth the style of the graphics are similar to Borderlands 2 but slightly more realistic. For those that would be more comfortable playing using an Xbox 360 controller there is full support. There is room for improvement in some areas though which I hope they patch:- No auto-save if you don't remember to press save you can potentially lose hours- Would be good to allow players to dock without switching to first person so they can also hire people and trade from the ****- First person has room for improvement- The targeting system is a little limited it would be good to be able to switch to a mini map at any time and also flick through near targets in order of distance and filter by either enemies friends owned by or goals- There needs to be more instruction to help the player early on in the game so they can learn the controls and how to play the game with ease maybe an auto-hint system which can be disabled or enabled,6,Enjoying the game so far. Much more fast paced than x3 which I thought was way too slow and honestly pretty boring. It feels like I'm actually playing a game this time instead of just navigating menus or spending half my time alt tabbed while my ships were on auto pilot. The new boost and highway systems are cool SETA was awful glad to see it go. Controls are pretty good once you getEnjoying the game so far.

It feels like I'm actually playing a game this time instead of just navigating menus or spending half my time alt tabbed while my ships were on auto pilot. The new boost and highway systems are cool SETA was awful glad to see it go. Controls are pretty good once you get used to them and combat can be pretty fun. Exiting your ship and walking around is a nice addition however some of the npcs look pretty awful. The worst thing about the game so far is the horrible optimization and some people have been mentioning bugs but I have yet to encounter one. Hopefully these will be fixed soon. Overall I think its a pretty good game but needs a little bit more work. Its going to attract a different crowd I think than the other x games.,9,From the start you get a feel of the vastness of space and this game with great new dynamics with fast travel and ship improvement. The economy feels alive and responsive to espionage and sabotage. Ship combat is way better and although the tutorial is still not that simple you get through it. Configuring a joystick takes some testing but can be done with patience and is well worth it.,9,Hi. I bought it yesterday.I just played 6h do I don't know much about the game like most of the people here. Yet I played dozens of hours at X3Tc and this one clearly changes a bit. But I like it. It's less boring much more beautiful and "alive". I thought I'd pay with my mouse and keyboard but in fact it's nicer to use my Xbox pad. True there are some bugs but not so much. TheHi.

Egosoft is a nice company I'm glad I gabe them some money by buying their game. I'm sure they will fix all the problem in a near future. Good game.,10,When I first played this game I would have scored it below 5 for the appalling bugs in the tutorial campaign which stopped me playing made me re-start several times. In-excusable! Now i have got 50+ Game hours I give this game a 10 because once you get passed that annoying buggy tutorial the game comes alive...its like a gold mine below what looks like a dirty mound...The badWhen I first played this game I would have scored it below 5 for the appalling bugs in the tutorial campaign which stopped me playing made me re-start several times.

This game is so huge and complex 2 hours is not enough. Fair enough like i say some of the bugs are absolutely in-excusable!But my goodness the game gets epic as you go along! I am hooked,7,I will start my review by correcting a couple things I have seen in other reviews. 1. OMG NO JOYSTICK SUPPORTS!!!!  Incorrect I have been playing on my joystick all day. The base layout however is terrible. I pushed the throttle up and my ship started turning. I started to turn and my ship fired rockets into a destroyer... who did not appreciate being shot with rockets. In short youI will start my review by correcting a couple things I have seen in other reviews. 1. OMG NO JOYSTICK SUPPORTS!!!!  Incorrect I have been playing on my joystick all day. The base layout however is terrible. I pushed the throttle up and my ship started turning. I started to turn and my ship fired rockets into a destroyer... who did not appreciate being shot with rockets. In short you just have to map them in game to work. 2. I can't invert the y axis!  Incorrect you can invert everything with mouse or joystick. Keep looking there is an option that says invert axis. Open that up and then invert options for everything comes up. 3. I have a top of the line pc but the games FPS makes it unplayable  Incorrect. While an engine built from the ground up is not going to be as efficient as an established engine with 50 people or so working on it like frostbyte this one is functional. I am running an I7 2700k EVGA GTX 680 16 gig ram and an Asus ROG main board. I get smooth frame rates at about 40 FPS with everything maxed out. Should it be better? Yes but it is certainly not unplayable. I imagine people with serious performance issues are long over due for a windows reinstall or in need of driver updates on the mainboard itself. Hopefully they at least have the GPU updated. For my own review of the game there are several things I don't like. The interface... is such a damn chore. Using it sucks the fun out of the game. Experienced X3 players like myself hate it. No matter what you say about it trying to make X-Rebirth work with a radial menu was a TERRIBLE IDEA. It really does feel like they only did this so they could port it to consoles. Seriously I have not noticed one advantage to this terrible design feature. I'm sorry Egosoft but it has to go or make another UI like we are used to and let us control our Empire like we should be able to. Give players the option to select either UI interface from the loading screen options menu. Character models  yes they are terrible but honestly I dont care. that is not why i play x games. hearing the same lines over and over.. that does get fast old. One of the first mods that i will download will be one that removes yisha's ability to say "no shut up betty!" Space Highways  I love them and hate them at the same time. While a great way (and awesome idea) to get around without SETA the minigame has got to go or at least be given the option to be disabled. I'm sorry but I dont want to play X Rebirth  Tokyo Drift. My viewing area is already limited by a  view I dont want to reduce it any more by having to draft behind another ship. Trading  Give the skunk more cargo area. Some people like myself actually enjoy being the ones to buy and sell goods. Taking away that option from me and forcing me to be the Albion Skunk Van Lines dispatch operator is not "freeing" me from anything except being able to do what i want to do. On that note and related to UI controlling ships needs a serious revamp. Nothing you did improved upon X3. IMO and many others it was a giant step backwards. Space and space cities looks great however I absolutely hate "collecting I's" It is as if you made these awesome stations and then were afraid that people would not look at them so you started saying "i'm make you look look at what i made LOOK AT IT LOOK AT IT LOOK AT IT!" Thats great believe me i would spend plenty of time on my own flying around stations without being forced to in order to collect Is. There is nothing "immersive" about the current system. I'm running out of characters. While my review seems harsh and does not match the 7 i give the game let me explain my reasoning. There is alot that is good about the game especially when you consider that a team of 30 people made it from the ground up while also working on expansions and supporting X3. If there is one thing that Egosoft has shown is that a game they release is only the beginning of it. They take feedback build on it and so on until at the end of life the original game is but a shadow of the true finished product. They give modders the tools they need to help customize the game to everyone's liking. The game works it looks good (except inside stations) and does have alot of depth. It is just currently held back by a few poor design choices IMO. Unlike other companies you know that between Egosoft and Modders they will be addressed. Just look at what X3 turned into. My 7 takes into account the history of Egosoft. The game -is- playable in current condition despite what the ADD kiddies are screaming on these forums. As expected though the game still need work and more time to grow. If you are unable to go through the growing pains with them then hold off on your purchase because you WILL regret it presently. Otherwise buy it and join in on the fun and the ride to the top.,10,This is a GREAT game. Really don't believe the crap some people are telling about this game.

Just saying. After 30 hours I just scratched the surface of what is possible and I'm finally beginning to understand it. The campaign is a good story (especially compared to X3) and nothing more than a very long (50 to 100 hours) tutorial after which you can play the real game. Manage huge big empires!,10,This game needs to be fixed and menus tables maps is needed to be made friendlier a lot things is needete to be done... but after that  this will be the greatest thinks i have ever seen !!!!!!!!!!!!!No doubt egosoft will patche it soon. So 10,8,Now please read my review before instantly disagreeing with me. I noticed that only the negative reviews seem to be respected because people don't like other opinions.

I noticed that only the negative reviews seem to be respected because people don't like other opinions. If you read this you can see why the game really doesn't deserve any 0 reviews. I was extremely pumped for the release of X Rebirth. I watched a lot of videos and upon playing it of course at first I felt a little underwhelmed. I looked at the metacritic score falling from 7 to 4 on the Friday alone but I thought I'd continue playing to see if it has any redeeming features. THE GOOD POINTS -Despite many people complaining about this I like the graphical detail especially on stationsStory line is interesting and enjoyableNew layout of sectors/zones is pretty niceSpace cities are awesomeThe ability to destroy parts of large ships and stations is realistic and rather brilliantVR Drones are a nice touch THE BAD POINTS -Pretty damned laggy even on minimum graphics with my computer supposedly in the "Recommended" area for hardware. (In addition: Frame rates can drop massively occasionally in stations or otherwise making it very difficult to know what you're doing)A few bugs can mess up fighting or force you to reloadHumanoid graphics are rather basicShip steering is slowGetting around menus is a pain in the arseMaps are poorly layed out (Not sure if you can zoom at all I haven't been able to as of yet) In conclusion I think the game wasn't ready for release. If they had waited until 15th November 2014 I think we'd have a winner on our hands. Personally I give the game somewhere between a seven and an eight out of ten (Put an 8 here because I really do like the game) because I can see past the minor faults and can eventually get used to the lag to see a potentially beautiful game. Personally I reckon the majority of people aren't giving the game enough time to mess around with and are getting hung up on the imperfections that I've outlined or their own personal vendettas against the game or indeed starting to attack Egosoft themselves! (Which in my opinion is rather pathetic). Of course the bad points means I cannot possibly give X Rebirth in excess of an eight but we'll see how long it take before these points are seen to.,9,I took the advice of the more level-headed reviewers here and tried the game out. Boy am I glad I did. The negative reviews are basically just fans of the previous X series complaining about the devs not giving them what THEY want and they're unhappy that the creators of Rebirth wish to appeal to the greater community instead of just a select few. They don't seem to realize that THIS ISI took the advice of the more level-headed reviewers here and tried the game out. Boy am I glad I did. The negative reviews are basically just fans of the previous X series complaining about the devs not giving them what THEY want and they're unhappy that the creators of Rebirth wish to appeal to the greater community instead of just a select few. They don't seem to realize that THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE X-4. It is a different game geared toward a different experience with a wider audience. I personally found it to be pretty awesome and extremely interesting. I've been waiting for a game like this for quite some time and it has satisfied the space sim fanatic in me. Again do NOT pay attention to the negative reviews they are based on pointless complaints that have more to do with the previous entries in the series than they do with Rebirth. My advice to those individuals who are immature enough to try and destroy a fantastic game is.....GO BACK AND PLAY THE PREVIOUS GAMES. Nobody is forcing you to play Rebirth and it IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SEQUEL so quit stomping your feet and re-download the titles that obviously act as your soother. The devs went a different route for a reason. If you don't like Rebirth that's fine go mod the daylights out the older games and leave this one to folks who want to have this fresh take on the X experience. A great game has been released whether the "old timers" like it or not. There are a few bugs of course (which are being patched) but I found myself ignoring them almost completely. Trust in the positive reviews as they are more truthful about this title. Again the negative reviews are based on whining about the devs not adhering to specific wants and needs. Also don't forget on metacritic there are folks sad enough who actually spend all day writing multiple reviews with several different accounts to increase the number of negative scores in selfish attempts at trying to sabotage this title. So please be aware that there is a relatively small amount of whiners who make their group look larger by doing this. Pay attention to the number of "likes" and "dislikes" too it's a dead give away and hilariously childish. Trust me give it a shot if you want a great space sim just weed through the BS posts and you'll find an awesome game!,8,to the contrary of most players i do enjoy this game. 20 hours in now. Yes there is a few annoying bugs but why did some games like say Skyrim which was released with many bugs too didn't get this treatment? Yes some features are rough like the NPC and walking around it isn't perfect but it isn't broken either. Old X players seemed to enjoy playing menus and spreadsheets. I did not.

The only thing i really really miss is the map and gravidar/radar from AP. We could use the ability to remap keys not that the default controls are not useable but without it it looks like a bad console port. The graphics are very nice if you got a good machine. Don't expect a good gameplay from a laptop. Get quad-core CPUs 8gb ddr3 ram nvidia 600 or higher video card and SSD drive. You can get all that for the price of a PS4!!!the story is fun and the game does a good job to get you in and teach you the basics. Do not listen to nay sayers give it a try and see for yourself! Sorry for my bad english.,10,Today have tested patch version 1.9 beta.Game run fast no freeze times anymore.Trade work PERFECT now! All ships flying & do work Please give a little time for development team> they do work every day now.,10,I really quite like what has been done with this X game. Its bold and adds some new cool ideas to the franchise for gamers that don't just live on X-3. I understand that bugs have caused a lot of hate (fixes inbound a lot faster than ubisoft will ever release them) but lots of pc releases have many bugs. its a lot easier to say what has bugs on release than what does not.

I play MANY different games and now there is a cool space sim that won't consume my entire gaming life. The other thing I would like to make the fans aware of is that because of all the stupid haters Egosoft (a small company in the first place) could very well go under because of the reviews posted meaning that X-4 or what ever it could have been called will never be released for the Previous X fans. Hard luck.,10,Played for 7 hours now didn't experience a crash so far Playing with a Nvidia Geforce GT 650M (notebook graphic card) it runs fine for me with low to middle settings graphic looks good even on low.

So here are my impressions. X Rebirth is a game based in the X universe.

So here are my impressions. X Rebirth is a game based in the X universe.  It is thirty five to forty years after the events of X3: Albion Prelude and a Supernova that shutdown the gates that allowed ships to travel between the stars.  Egosoft has done an excellent job in creating a more cohesive and expansive universe with the sectors spanning huge areas and not just an eighty by eighty kilometer area from X3AP.  The combat gets harder as the plot also used as a tutorial progresses with the player eventually being able to build their own stations ships and developing a trade empire. Unfortunately the release of the game also showed off the darker side of things with bugs and issues that can interrupt game play.  Your mileage in this regard may vary but Egosoft has made it clear they intend to support the game for years to come and to make sure it is patched properly. As for the interface this can get in the way of the game.  While ship controls are strong controlling other ships you own has been lost in translation.  But have no fear for modders are here.  The vast majority of the game is not hard coded and so things like the AI game assets and more are all fair game for modding.  Ship orders being one of the first things on the modders hit lists. The game does appear to have elements that were meant for consoles.  But those to will get patches to help fix what is clearly broken.  Why they are there is any ones guess.  But I hope that Egosoft learns and that the fans and new players alike can enjoy this game.  I know I am and I played X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude.,8,Looking past the unfinished game there are a lot of positives from it at its core at its current state you cant ignore the many broken scripts and the UI is interesting to say the least.

My opinion this will like all the Xs before will turn into a great game.,9,21 hours played so far  Great game.  It's a bit different yes  but i knew that when i bought it  and after a while it really is starting to feel like an X game.

I only rated it that to offset the overwhelming number of zeros that I also believe this game doesn't deserve. I'd rate it somewhere in the seven range. Graphics: The outer-space visuals are absolutely majestic. That is if you can manage to get your game maxed on that brand-new video card you just bought. I wonderLet me start off by saying that I don't believe this game deserves a 10. I only rated it that to offset the overwhelming number of zeros that I also believe this game doesn't deserve. I'd rate it somewhere in the seven range. Graphics: The outer-space visuals are absolutely majestic. That is if you can manage to get your game maxed on that brand-new video card you just bought. I wonder what's up with that. On the platforms however the immersion suffers. The people look like well total crap. The lighting can be a bit odd. The animations are a bit weak. The list goes on. Immersion factor: Well done. Simply put. Depth: You can only pilot one ship but there are numerous upgrades to each of the ship's systems so you won't feel like you're flying an enormous space turd for the entire game (just most of it). The universe also starts off pretty restricted at least in the campaign mode leaving you with only a handful of places to explore which is also kind of a downpoint. Controls: Unless you have an Xbox 360 controller you're going to spend a fair portion of your time playing weeping heavily at the new menus. No I'm not kidding. Gameplay: The combat is fun the trading not so much. In fact it seems trading is broken entirely when it comes to big capitol ships. That really takes away from most of the X experience. The AI is also rather dumb especially when you can't progress in the campaign because your freighter won't accept any trade orders. But I assume that'll be patched soon so I'm not really putting that towards the score. Performance: As I stated previously it can be bad for absolutely no apparent reason. There are a number of workarounds already out like replacing a d3d9.dll with one specifically made for your video card but otherwise a computer that can run BF4 on ultra and get 40 frames per second should reasonably be able to run this game without a hiccup. But it doesn't and that's the biggest problem with this game. Hopefully that will get patched soon too. Overall: For a newbie to the X series start here. The learning curve is easier and it'll just make you love all the old ones that much more. For the X Veterans looking to get this run as fast as you can and never look back because this just isn't the game you've been waiting seven years for. Personally I like the way it plays and I intend to put a lot of hours into it. But that 's just my opinion and if I know anything about the internet it's that opinions don't matter.,7,X Rebirth is a particular titleA game never intended to and will never  pertain to broadest audience.But nonetheless X Rebirth as a continuum of the franchise is ever getting bigger wider more choices and more freedom.Ok the game bugs can be frustrating and who knows perhaps more optimized textures may come along too.My point is that an average of 3.3 is pretty harshX Rebirth is a particular titleA game never intended to and will never  pertain to broadest audience. But nonetheless X Rebirth as a continuum of the franchise is ever getting bigger wider more choices and more freedom.Ok the game bugs can be frustrating and who knows perhaps more optimized textures may come along too.My point is that an average of 3.3 is pretty harsh considering the intention.I mean is Bf4 3.3? after it is still very buggy.Is Rome II 3.3? after all it is still AI ****The list can go on and on of worst to mild bugged up game yet because of load of PR and marketing the game never goes below 5 yet X Rebirth appears like the vengeance of the gamers ready to knife it down at first frustration.So really gamers do you always need to be lubed by a good PR to make you like a game whether with no mild  or frustrating bugs while knowing patch will come along?,9,I'm a long time fan of the X series l've played all the games... after playing for 5ish hours it's good so far. No performance issues here looks great! If it's like all the other X games it takes 20+ hours to actually get into... the X games aren't for everyone...,10,It's an amazing breathtaking game! Yep... I have also hit a point where the bugs are making it unplayable for the time being but these are minor issues (trade ship has too many orders...once again etc). I've played through most of the campaign and the ideas behind this game are fantastic. Give them a few months to make some patches and it will be incredible! It's like GTA5 but in space!,10,Definitely has some bugs on launch and some users have reported performance issues. Personally I am having a problem-free experience and I am really enjoying this deep space simulation. I have the previous X games but was not a big fan.,5,I noticed a lot of people gave the game low scores because it's very buggy which is fair but many games are launched buggy so I didn't let it bother me.  The game will be patched over time as other X game series have in past to the full potential.  I played the game for about 8 hours so far.  Had crashing issues but it was solved by simply changing my windows sound settings. THE GOODI noticed a lot of people gave the game low scores because it's very buggy which is fair but many games are launched buggy so I didn't let it bother me.

The game does a really good job at immersion (that also means no 3rd person view YAY!).  The universe is huge with lots of things for discover.  You feel like you're a part of it.  I love landing on repair stations and looking out and seeing the rest of the station around me.  Lots of stuff to do if you're willing to take the time to explore. THE BADLots of bugs some are game breaking.  Somewhat steep learning curve.  Feels like a console to PC port.  B movie campaign story line and voice acting.  Some areas have low textures and player models have weird necks.  Long load times.  Generic FPS station layouts.  Inability to change font size.  Can't walk around on bridge of your ship only the cargo hold.  Can't bind some menu hotkeys. This game will be good to revisit once all the bugs/glitches are fixed in future patches.,8,A very good game. Do not be fooled by the "I personally didn't like it so its a 0" folks. X Rebirth is an acquired taste like most of the X series. The graphics overall are beautiful. Sprawling space stations and factory complexes reflect the orange-red glow of a nearby sun as the tiny blinking blue and red lights of trading ships pass in between structures creating a highly immersiveA very good game. Do not be fooled by the "I personally didn't like it so its a 0" folks. X Rebirth is an acquired taste like most of the X series. The graphics overall are beautiful. Sprawling space stations and factory complexes reflect the orange-red glow of a nearby sun as the tiny blinking blue and red lights of trading ships pass in between structures creating a highly immersive and eye catching environment. Textures aren't particularly high-res and this is especially apparent on the character models but egosoft has shown that you don't need those to make a game look brilliant. Ship combat is roughly the same as in previous X games at least in the early game. Combat Ai seems to have improved a bit and the game can get quite difficult at points. Travel is quite fun with the new highway system and they completely did away with the annoying seta drive. Once again its still too early for me to rate the economic and high strategy elements but from what I've seen so far the game feels more alive and more complex every time I complete a mission. Voice acting and the overall campaign are rather 'meh' so far but missions are generally fun and npcs are not completely unlikable. Lack of ship variety (theres only one) is the disappointment to me; you can customize your ship to your playstyle to a pretty high degree but it still doesn't quite feel right without being able to buy a different ship if only for cosmetic reasons. The game is not optimized for a lot of hardware so if you buy it immediately don't expect it to run without some tweaking. I don't subtract points from my ratings for running issues (unless they are particularly bad) usually because almost every game has them at launch and I don't feel like they subtract from the experience in the long run. Egosoft's vision for this game had a very high bar and I feel that this game embodies the most important parts of that vision: Freedom immersion and a game that is easy to get into but has layers of complexity hidden beneath. If you are considering buying this game right now I would say that you should wait a bit for the patches unless you're a technical user and don't mind a bit of messing around with settings. If your looking a great 4X space sim you should definitely consider rebirth.,7,The reason I purchased this game may have had something to do with the awesome soundtracks they added in the trailers. Or perhaps it's just my love for space games. The graphics in X Rebirth prove not to be anything of substantial note. The tutorial is confusing I had to look online for additional help for gameplay during the tutuorial itself.

Or perhaps it's just my love for space games. The graphics in X Rebirth prove not to be anything of substantial note. The tutorial is confusing I had to look online for additional help for gameplay during the tutuorial itself. I must mention the repeat enviroment as well. It is a pretty sight flying around initially but after a few hours of gameplay you've seen it all. However this game has some serious promise. Not many space game's on the market. Eve "online" taking the cake for sure. I will continue playing the game to see if it can tug my curiosity further. X Rebirth has some serious potential so I give it a 7/10.,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Just ignore most of the negative complaints. Most of these people have played   less then a couple hours or they're X2-3 fanatics that just never bothered to read and believed this was going to be X4. I've now played about 10 hours in and haven't had one crash and no bugs so far.   I'd probably give it a 7 but seeing all the bandwagoneers putting out 0's and having played a few mins irks me. I think imo the biggest hurdle for new and old players is the UI.  It's definitely designed for the xbox.  It's similar to the  PC UI in Skyrim and I remember how much backlash there was against that. It will take some hours to get used to the interface for sure. I started with key/mouse and after awhile set up my xbox controller  It's  really and I mean really easy to play with the controller. X Rebirth definitely has more of a story plot then the previous releases.  Your sent  around the system and taught the basics of the gameplay and UI by doing small missions. This leads to problems in some cases where a little more detail mission briefings would be nice.   The get 100 energy cells mission for instance would benefit from this. I know a lot of people were stuck/confused on that one. I took me an hour to complete it because the directions were a bit unclear. The game has a few mini games  to play while traveling that really don't add much to the game other then get you to your destination faster (highways) or get you better deals or contacts in stations (small talk)   still  they're mildly entertaining. Combat so far has been really easy (I'm hoping that's cause I'm just starting)  It's pretty easy to kill the first few enemies you run across. Your ship starts out fairly weak but you can get upgrades and drones that will help you fight. Haven't had much time to do many missions. The only ones I've done are escort ship and transfer people around from station to station. You can help protect stations from intruders. ProMore involved story line.More things to do/ keep you busy.  No long boredom traveling like in prev x games. this might actually   be a con for some. ConUI that's takes some time to figure out unless you have a gamepad.UI again  yep it's badone ship   put this here since I really like commanding more ships in prev x games Anyways it's not great that's for sure and has room for improvement. but way better then the 0's people are floating around here.   People are already making mod's that hopefully will end up making the game great.,0,I take it all back this game hasn't improved anywhere near as much as I hoped it would and what we are left with is a drastic decrease in quality compared to the games preceding it.,8,The wildly mixed reviews are due to the wide difference between computer specs. not really as a matter of power but as a matter of configuration. It will take some time before the game is optimized for every system type. I am unfortunately on the bad end of the system config with an AMD processor and an ATI graphics card.

It will take some time before the game is optimized for every system type. I am unfortunately on the bad end of the system config with an AMD processor and an ATI graphics card. I'm guessing there will either need to be a specific rebirth driver or a patch for AMD based machines because the current performance is next to unplayable. I'm somewhat more forgiving than most because I've been gaming on laptops for the last 7 years and 20 fps is a dream come true for me. But fudge graphics and fudge frame rates. From what I've played its an excellent game. It just has some MAJOR teething problems that need to be resolved on the software side of things ASAP. I look forward to playing the completed version.,8,Yes there are bugs yes there are issues I've had to load a saved game more than a few times HOWEVER I do enjoy the game the graphics the immersion. The new ideas brought into the game are nice and I am very much looking forward to having zero issues playing. It is stressful to play at times since things just don't seem to work as intended or there is simply not enough direction toYes there are bugs yes there are issues I've had to load a saved game more than a few times HOWEVER I do enjoy the game the graphics the immersion.

I give this game an 8 out of 10 since while it does have it issues I can see past those and find the game it was/going to be. Here's hoping for a fix and dramatic fix ASAP.,10,More than a year after its initial release X: Rebirth has seen a myriad of patches and a few content additions which made what was originally a painful-at-best experience and turned it into a truly enjoyable space simulation. Quite simply they didn't give up on the game as so many reviewers and players did.

In reality they likely released a little too early and without sufficient testing but in this case the end justifies the means.  The amount of help they have received from the community in finding bugs is apparent as the game is now relatively bug-free. I have over 200 hours logged into the game with the first 100 played in the first couple months of release.  To think that this is the same game that was maligned by critics over a year ago would be a mistake.,10,the game feel just so amazing seriously the game is amazing but need some serious optimisation by egosoft. but that normal so please stop giving this game 0 score,10,I am pretty happy with the game.Didnt have any major problems with playing exept some small fps drops.I really really like the ideas they have put into the game.

X Rebirth has great potential ahead and I'm already enjoying it as it currently. V1.12 fixed an FPS bug that affected a fair amount of people which is really great. I love seeing how games develop so I can't wait to see what unfolds in the coming months,10,As some of the comments have already said this game has more bugs than roadkill. There are broken sections crashes issues with game play. So why rate it a 10 well I have played it for 28 hours and enjoyed 27 of them. The team behind this are working very hard to fix the issues and have made massive improvements already.  This will be an amazing game when they have finished.

This game was simply released too soon.,6,While it is easily the most beautiful and "alive" galaxy in an X game (or any similar title) shortcomings like hideous character design and low-res cut-and-paste interiors really wear on you after a little while.

The lack of basic features like detailed fleet commands is a baffling change and would be even if the wonky ship AI always worked as intended. The map is nearly useless in its current state and target tracking in combat leaves a lot to be desired. (Combat itself however is quite good.) The campaign isn't terrible but bad voice-acting holds it back. Myriad small bugs litter the game from beginning to end though most of these are par for the course with Egosoft and will be fixed. I liked the older X games but I always found them sterile clunky and unintuitive. As such I can appreciate what the developer attempted to accomplish with a more accessible title but the execution is off. Many old fans are put off by the streamlining and would-be new fans are put off by the bugs. Rebirth needs a lot of work to even have any hope of enduring like its predecessors. Fortunately Egosoft's history of post-release support is good but only time will tell what becomes of this troubled entry in the X franchise. All that said I am still enjoying the game quite a bit (sitting at 19 hours as I write this) but I must reluctantly suggest to any prospective buyers that waiting is your best choice right now.,10,I love the game the controls are amazing on an X360 gamepad it feels like space and it's a lot faster than X3 ! I just feel like there isn't much of a scenario yet but there is a HUGE potential. The game is really a sandbox,10,Personally haven't gotten a chance to try this game out yet but am looking forward to it. I just came here to help level the review field here from all of these 0 scores I've been reading through. Do you guys even know what a 0 score means?!?!

Seriously it is a shame that so many of you fail to realize the negative impact you cause developers with such garbage reviews. I see plenty of helpful responses to the 0's 1's and 2's as well sadly. I personally used to love metacritic for its user review feedback but in the past couple years it has become a pathetic board of whiny brats. If you gave a 0 1 or 2 to this game shame on you as a gamer. Shame on you for poisoning a game on launch day 1 with such biased and uninformative reviews. Learn a little about how a 10 point review system actually works. If you have issues with a game feel free to post but a 0 is unplayable and sorry but I have been watching plenty of day one coverage on twitch and youtube today and this game is far from a 0. If you are a X3 fan and do not like the massive changes to the game that's perfectly fine voice your opinion. However when you do so be a little more constructive in your assessment. We've all seen what a 0-2 score resembles if you don't look up a game called Big Rigs Over The Road Racing or more recently AngryJoe reviewed a game called Ride To Hell. Please just think about it.,9,The Score is based upon less than 20 hours expierence after release. i think it is a good baseline...from the devs now let the community of modders take care of the rest!first of all i want to state that the new graphic-engine is (even if still under dx9) very impressive and give a very good debute  the style of graphical display is not "to comic" as much people feared. theThe Score is based upon less than 20 hours expierence after release. i think it is a good baseline...from the devs now let the community of modders take care of the rest! first of all i want to state that the new graphic-engine is (even if still under dx9) very impressive and give a very good debute  the style of graphical display is not "to comic" as much people feared. the surroundings of stations are quite busy and a lot of things to see around here. many things are like in older x games some are not  of course: in an rebirth. the features we are now seeing currently are just a start of what we all hope is coming in the near future!the bugs we are now seeing on the start. some very drastic and some are more cosmetic problems  are hopefully fixed within the next 2 weeks. i got what i expected a great structure to build a new state of the art X-Game with the help of the Modding Community. What is basically needed is the full support of Egosoft and Deepsilver to get this working. The potential is given with the current release... For all which are expected an ready to fly full scale space-opera are sure a bit dissappointed  but do not give up and wait a couple of weeks...modding has already begun and egosoft is worth to put some trust in this product...,9,Compared to X3: Albion Prelude the graphics are significantly better. Still is pretty buggy BUT the gameplay stays true to the X universe style. The DEV'S just released a new patch which has really helped cut down on the amount of crashes I am having.,10,I have not played previous X games but I was drawn to this one because I love space games.

As for gameplay the controls for the ship interface is smooth especially with a controller plugged in combat is fantastic as I go out of my way just to kill some badies here and there. I can't wait to start with gaining ships to expand my trading empire and other such things. Overall it's a fun game and worth a buy.,10,Good game for  plenty of content and what to donormal graphics. All very negative coments is from that kind of people who say heroes of might and magic 3 is beter then any other version but look into whose people who play homm 3 in 2013 :D their opinion just doesnt matter for normal people :D,10,A good game send 10/10 to counter "angry red kid".Like EVERY X  bugged on the out date need to be patch and after he willa awesome. It's just a question of time never forget this  it's not a game you can test in one hours.,8,This game is great and does run well contrary to what others have said. I have an I5 2500 with Radeon 6870 and 16 GB of RAM and the graphics look great with smooth frames-per-second. I imagine some people either just like to complain or they have so much spyware/bloatware on the system that that is the cause of any slowdown. Gameplay wise there is a length tutorial to the campaignThis game is great and does run well contrary to what others have said.

I imagine some people either just like to complain or they have so much spyware/bloatware on the system that that is the cause of any slowdown. Gameplay wise there is a length tutorial to the campaign which does mean you follow a linear path for a while  but this is a good thing as it teaches you the mechanics of the game. The developers stated they wanted a complex game but not a complicated one. They have delivered on that the interface is much easier to use but there is a lot of depth still. You may only directly pilot one ship but you can command massive fleets still. Die hard fans who are actually aware of the gamelore can see good reason to sticking to the one ship "Albion Skunk" which was originally the "Pride of Albion" a one of a kind ship that any military would have loved to mass produce. Other ships of a similar size would be a DOWNGRADE. There is plenty of room to upgrade it and as mentioned you can still buy/build massive flights. The graphics in space are amazing but I will be honest the in station and character graphics are not as good as the rest which is why I give this game an 8/10 not or 9 or 10. That said being able to walk on stations is a welcome addition you can explore ventilation shafts and fine hidden items (usually illegal contraband goods) which is great if you love the smuggling side of the game. Very happy with my purchase.,10,I do NOT work for Egosoft and never had the patience for previous X games. But this looked so good in the trailer resistance was futile. Four days after release I bought it despite the terrible initial user reviews.

Story/tutorial works great so far (not Shakespeare I Know). Mouse keyboard control quite intuitive. Constant updating should give most the positive experience I've enjoyed.

And when there is hope there is gold to be earned.,10,I have been playing the X series games since the year 2000. I love them and I love this game. Beautiful job. Works like a charm.

Gamers are not a hive mind so throw out the very low scores and very high scores and get closer to the truth of the matter with the middling scores. Personally I love this game. It is everything I hoped for.,9,I'm new to the X series so for all you die-hard fans who say it's not good enough to be an X game or a disgrace to the series I can't argue with you there as I've never played any of the other games.

However X-Rebirth was quite a delightful surprise for me. It's incredibly immersive the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the possibilities are endless with such a massive and diverse sandbox. I have encountered a single error that resulted in a sudden shut down of the game but that's the only major crash issue I've experiences. It's a very demanding game as well and you'll need a decent computer to run it. However I think the content is excellent and it's a very fun and immersive game for me to play. I trust that the bugs will be patched shortly and hopefully the graphical demands optimized for lower end PCs. All in all a very nice game in my book.,10,I will not lie at the launch it was sadly surprisingly "buggy" and un-optimized. With low framerates around 13-30FPs (average 18fps for me) crashes and game breaking bugs. But with a few tweaks you could easily boost it to an average of 24 fps. Sure that is pretty low  but It was still Very playable.Its only been five days since it was released and they already released 3 patches  atmI will not lie at the launch it was sadly surprisingly "buggy" and un-optimized.

And these fixed the game breaking bugs (like not being able to board capital ships to some crashes.). Looking past the launch issues and the clear performance issues. Its indeed a very enjoyable game. It looks great better than any other X-Series game (and FINALLY they fixed the explosions the previous games explosions looked like a 2d animation). I am amazed how real it actually is and feels. Only having the ability to personally pilot one ship dose not really feel like a bad thing to me. Its actually a pretty good ship  and customization (with the ability to buy upgrades with different abilities  like stronger shield or faster recharge  or just have it balanced all together). It really feels like you are the captain of your own "Firefly" vessel :P. Just wow i love it :P Besides considering you still can hire NPCs for capital ships build amazing stations working for you. Im really happy with this game. At the time of this review im getting around 30-70FPS depending on where i am on the star map (only the starting area gives me a constant 18-30 fps other than that its very up and down)... So i honestly don't know why people are acting space happy atm (in the bad way  firefly reference :P) And Knowing Egosoft from the past  the WILL continue fixing the game up for a very long time into the future. Just as they still are with their previous games from x3 Reunion to Albion Prelude. All "recently patched by the developers If you love space simulators  Get this game! Don't hesitate!If you do find uneven FPS and a few game disturbing (not breaking) bugs annoying though  wait a week or two and get it after a few more patches so around mid December or so (or get it now and wait to play after that :P).In either case  This is a really cool game,10,This is the third time I've gambled on an X game: I struggled with X2 and X3 longing for that Freelancer  Earth and Beyond  Independence War 2  EVE feel and never quite getting it. It was always too cold too empty too inscrutable. This version finally made everything click. I don't care a bit that it crashes every few hours  I grew up with Wing Commander bailing out and Sierra gamesThis is the third time I've gambled on an X game: I struggled with X2 and X3 longing for that Freelancer  Earth and Beyond  Independence War 2  EVE feel and never quite getting it. It was always too cold too empty too inscrutable. This version finally made everything click. I don't care a bit that it crashes every few hours  I grew up with Wing Commander bailing out and Sierra games murdering me. I can handle hitting the quick save button every so often. 95% of the complaints that I've heard about this game are patently false  clearly the result of people who are butthurt about change. The new in-ship UI is a GOOD thing grognards. The face and body models are no worse than Morrowind  which played Just Fine. Combat feels natural and effortless and _obvious_. The stations seem alive and organic. It's a delight flying around and exploring them. The so-called 'game breaking tutorial bugs' have simple workarounds usually in-game workarounds discoverable with 5 seconds' googling. The framerate drops when I swing the camera around a station. This does not break the game: it doesn't even affect gameplay. If this were a 2000-person team like Diablo 3 I'd be shocked but at around twenty? Yeah I can deal with a framerate judder. On my 2-year old _laptop_ no less. This is a delightful fun and incredibly deep and complex game that no longer requires a Dwarf Fortress level of determination to get into. It's all just right there and it's fun. Buy this immediately.,9,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.

Quick Save Alot,9,This game is a lot of fun. I've spent a good 20+ hours on it already and I -think- I'm pretty far in the story. The music is great while flying through space however the music while'st flying through the 'space highways' sounds odd and cheesey..

I have played the game for 20+ hours already and here is my review. The game was launched with a lot of bugs. But within 2 days they had a patch witch solved most of the crashing issues!The game looks awesome and plays decently. There is a TON of content in the game when you start  to play it longer.

But within 2 days they had a patch witch solved most of the crashing issues!The game looks awesome and plays decently. There is a TON of content in the game when you start  to play it longer. There is automated trading after you build a station and buying trading software.The one thing that people seem to forget about this game is that it is called X-Rebirth for a reason!It is not intended to be like the older games!They are using a new game engine for this game. Also it is intended to be played on consoles as well.At launch there has been a lot of bugs but within 2 days crash issues were solved. They are working very hard on fixing bugs as well.To rate the game on gameplay alone.. Here we go.I'll start with graphics. The game looks absolutely fantastic! Every sector and system has a different look. And they all look great! All stations and ships are extremely detailed. In fact It is rare to see this level in detail in other games. Just start taking a closer look at stations. There are internal windows where you can watch products being made. Also each station has moving elevators and trains and far as I can see.The menu system takes a good while to get used to especially for people who played previous X games. But when you get used to it it works ok. I will admit it is optimized for controller use. In the future the devs may offer options if not modders will. Hell in games past modders have created such good mods that Egosoft has instituted them in later games!Ok on to content!There is no lack of  content in the game compared to previous games. The difference is that you have to look around a little more and they are set up very differently. Automated trade comes after buying trade software and building a station! Plus hiring crew for the station.I rate this game as 9/10 because even with the very buggy launch I am confident that in 3/6 months with Egosoft and the community pulling together it will be a truly fantastic game and a 10/10.,10,Great game. Some said there are lot of bugs while I don't meet with. You should first make it clear it's a bug or a problem caused by you hardware. And have you indeed learned how to play?,10,I'm here to give my honest opinion on this game amid a lot of hate being thrown at it from some of the player reviews here.

In a nutshell this is an engrossing experience that you can get lost in and find yourself in love with should you be willing to exercise a little patience and faith in the game that Egosoft has built here. I will admit right off that my 10/10 scoring is to help counter-balance many completely unfair 0/10 reviews by others here.  That's crazy as nearly no game deserves a "0" review only games truly broken and unplayable.  This game is FAR from that and I want to state that again:  This game is FAR better than the negative reviews here will mention.  Please remember that although there are 500 or so negative reviews here with the positive and mixed reviews growing after release many thousands of people are busy playing and enjoying the deep complex fascinating game that is X Rebirth. Too often do we as players and critics alike bow down to the standards and expectations of the mainstream gaming community.  I expect that this game may not break a "50" here on Metacritic in the weeks following it's release but that in months and especially years down the road will be seen as a triumph for those whom played it.  Unfortunately there are bugs and issues in this game and it is by no means polished yet.  Far from it.  That being said again it deserves a far more in-depth glance from you as a potential buyer far more especially than reading a few ignorant "0" reviews and dismissing this game. For full disclosure I'm not very familiar with nor have I played any of the other X Series games in the past.  I only learned about this game a few weeks ago while looking into alternatives to a few of the space combat and explorations games on the market now.  For some time now I've been wanting a sandbox space exploration game with a mix of space combat and ground/station exploration and interaction.  Coming from the angle of being a huge Morrowing/Skyrim/Fallout 3 buff as well as a SWG: Jump to Lightspeed fan I have spent a long time looking for the perfect combination of gameplay mechanics from those handful of games and genres.  This is it right here.  If you give it the chance. First off from the moment I first launched a Campaign (see: extended tutorial) mode game the game crashed to desktop.  It did that a few more times over a few hours and I also had an issue at first getting the game to recognize my gaming laptop's dedicated video card (rather than the other one also available a high-efficiency Intel GPU).  I overcame those issues tweaked some sound and graphics settings and troubleshooted it where it sounds like other negative review users here just gave up. Aside from the Campaign you can choose to start a "Free Play" game where the game will thrust you into a bit of a character creation and free-form "here's the universe" while nudging you over the precipice of "go explore it."  The game is incredibly involving and engrossing as mentioned before but can be broken by a few immersion-killing glitches and dialog from time to time. The NPC voice acting particularly your female co-pilot is fairly bad.  Oddly enough there are a limited set of responses that in the future could be re-acted by modders and replaced.  I'll hold out hope for that in the future but yes as others have mentioned the voice acting can be quite bad.  However you shouldn't allow that to break the entire experience.  Coming from an angle of loving Morrowind a game FULL of glitches I didn't allow NPC or (text) dialog glitches to stop me from enjoying the incredible experience that was that.  I've given up on believing that the co-pilot is a human and have decided she is an android to save my sanity more than anything else.  So yes it's bad voice acting but not worth disregarding the game completely much less giving it a "0" review.  Given the supportive community and modding opportunities I see plenty of promise in re-acted character voices expanded station interiors and variety and many other possibilities.  From a positive mindset this game has the most promise of any game I have seen in years should you choose to give it the chance. If you subscribe to the mainstream "If it's not a polished AAA title that critics love I'm not going to play it or enjoy it!" then you won't enjoy it.  Sometimes games fall beyond the bounds of what the mainstream enjoys or what the critics will award good reviews to.  X Rebirth is one of these games.  It is not entirely revolutionary by itself so much as it is revolutionary in the fact that it's taken the mechanics and aspects of numerous genres and put them into the huge scope and sprawling sandbox environment that it has. Any game and this game in particular is just as much what YOU make it as a player as it is what the developers have created it to be. I promise you:  If you give it the chance you will love this game.,8,Up to this point and +30 hours of play I have enjoyed this game.

The atmosphere and space world graphics are very impressive. The highways are very well thought out removing the need for SETA which actually was a good decision. I really enjoyed discovering new sectors than any other game of the X series. The fighting mechanics have improved maybe a bit too easy but its hard to balance such a complex game with little player feedback. Disappointed that the game is still far to buggy and still crashes though frame rates are very good for quad core cpu  2.8.ghz. I am sure knowing what the developers did with previous releases this will be a great game.,8,I have played most of the x games and the one thing that kept me from enjoying them were the docking and long travel times.  It was a pain to find what you wanted.  I heard that at release this game was horrible but not now in my opinion.  It is easy to get around and the trading is complex yet easy enough to figure out.  You can zip around stations and the graphics look great.  TheI have played most of the x games and the one thing that kept me from enjoying them were the docking and long travel times.

You can zip around stations and the graphics look great.  The only thing I really hate is the voice overs that suck.  These are easily modded out though so I am enjoying this game much more than the unfinished Star Citizen and Elite.,6,In it's current state I'd have to mark it down due to the number of bugs and questionable design decisions such as lack of command management on capital ships. The game has a great deal of potential though and will probably be worthy of a higher score after fixes and a greater number of command options are added.,8,I have been waiting awhile for this title and while it may be in need of some patching I've been having fun with it.  Sure I miss the assortment of flyable ships but X Rebirth is less boring than previous X-Series games.  Glad to have a PC Space Sim to pass the time while waiting for Star Citizen.  This will do just fine.,6,I installed X-rebirth on fresh installation of Win7 64bit. No single crash so far so I highly recommend to have "healthy" system.

New controls and ways of playing is well... it is completely new interface and new game you have to learn it but I was surprised it is not so bad as I read on forums.  It is step forward but egosoft will need to work on this game and already is hard working. I see bright future for this game. And excuse me now I am going to play it again...,7,This is going to take time to give a full review as progress is ongoing but to cap it off Big Patch after Big Patch. 4/10Game version 1.0-1.5 was seriously crippled by bugs that made the game unplayable for many including myself.It had bare-bones features the economy was dead on arrival and simply crippling bugs made allot of features dead on arrival.

I'm a defender of Egosoft but the game at this stage of it's development was unacceptable.  4/10 Version 2.0 - 2.5 was a major improvement to the game the Economy was starting to look like it showed signs of life new features ships introduced and allot of game shattering bugs fixed.But it still has allot of work on it to do if it wants to get a better rating and claw back it's support.5.5/10 Version 3.0 - 3.10 I believe is the pivotal moment in the updates that showed that X-Rebirth can turn a disastrous release around.. Most of the worst bugs have been fixed (still plenty more to fix) optimization is a hell of allot better the Economy in my game is 90% fixed and wares are being made exchanged and very hard to catch up to.More ship commands (still more needed) a free DLC for owners of the game within a 3 month time period (Egosoft said to be currently doing something about those that missed the deadline)You can now build in Empty Space and name the Space which has been a demand with X Fans for years.Loads of new Missions including Chain Missions rewards for missions have been re-valued so you can get 2 million credits for escorting a diplomat etc.We can now buy Medium/Small freighters and fighters from Shipyards/Lots. All in all a vast improvement I still feel allot is still missing from the game but when 4.0 comes out I'll update this review my current rating is. ----------7/10----------,10,This is one of the best games I have ever played.

Added to that is the fact that it has alienated many of the existing X fans being a departure from the series.  So the complaints are coming from two directions. And behind the bugs there are some real failing the UI is far from great npcs are ugly the maps are pretty useless and you can't give the detailed instructions to your fleet of ships that you could before.  Ego have promised to fix these things by December. But many things are greatly improved.  In space it is one of the most gorgeous games ever it is huge vast and sand box space cities are enormous and wonderfully detailed your ship handles a treat weapons and missiles are awesome and you can trade destroy and pillage to your heart's content.  Boarding capital ships is simply awesome and the entire universe is devoid of a single load screen. Sadly yes Ego release unfinished games and then proceed to fix bugs for weeks but also improve functionality for years.  Even if you have to put up with a few frustrations this game is an unbelievably vast and ambitious project which takes you to a beautiful organic universe.  This is a 1000hr game one you'll keep coming back to and one that will keep getting better.,8,X-Rebirth is a great start to a reboot of an amazing space sim series.

I don't think this is a bad game but it just isn't what I expect from X series. Graphics is good bugs have been ironed out with patches but concept is just not what I wanted.
