5,Look at the critics review and the only yellow review by AltGaming basically describes the game. Blizzard doesn't care about keeping the players that like to play Blizzard likes keeping the players that like to pay. Which is why they have had 12 million players in 2010 and now have 6.8 million in 2014. But are now making 4.76 billion in 2014 opposed to the 1.1 billion in 2011.,0,Blizzard has ruined WoW - don't even give it a chance. There is much better and newer MMOs to spend your money on. WoW isn't good for you don't try it...,0,WoW was a fantastic game in the past. It was filled with adventure discovery and most importantly teamwork. However the game has been going downhill recently with the release of the new expansion the Mists of Pandaria. It has become too simplistic and plays like a console game. There is no sense of accomplishment and adventure anymore. Clearly Blizzard is now targeting a differentWoW was a fantastic game in the past.

It has become too simplistic and plays like a console game. There is no sense of accomplishment and adventure anymore. Clearly Blizzard is now targeting a different demographic - the game is now for kids. If you enjoy paying a monthly fee AND playing with (other) children this game might be for you.,1,Boring once you reach 60. It's Everquest all over again but not as well developed.,10,I loved this so much it's definitely the best game in the universe. It offers MONTHS upon MONTHS of content you will end up with wanting to do nothing but play this game for your entire life. Blizzard are truly geniuses.,9,WoW Vanilla during it's inception was the best of the best. It was fun challenging and it really opened up a lot of the story from the originally Warcraft games for PC. It was something truly inspiring to behold and for all intensive purposes still is. For how long may be another story. While I cannot particularly recommend it anymore you can always try the free-to-play until level 20WoW Vanilla during it's inception was the best of the best. It was fun challenging and it really opened up a lot of the story from the originally Warcraft games for PC. It was something truly inspiring to behold and for all intensive purposes still is. For how long may be another story. While I cannot particularly recommend it anymore you can always try the free-to-play until level 20 version. This will give you a good idea of what you'd be doing until level 85 if you choose to go that far. Now you can get this and the Burning Crusade expansion for $20. So if you want a 70 twink it's wonderful. Otherwise you'll have to purchase the other two expansions (around $40.00 each or $80 and 10% off with a current special from the Blizzard Online Store) to get the newer content. It really depends on your person if you should do that. I would recommend trying before you buy. This is not the World of Warcraft we knew years ago. Hopefully they will drop the insane prices on subscriptions and expansions that might make this more desirable. I think they need to stop treating this as their money horse or they are going to end up losing a lot of business in the future. Just my two cents.,8,Coming from an old-school through Cata WoW player I'd say this game is hard to give a flat rating because it's gone through so many changes. If you're new to WoW on the lvl 20 cap you must understand leveling and the content you see while in trial is not what the games about. The game for you will change drastically once you hit level cap.

If you're new to WoW on the lvl 20 cap you must understand leveling and the content you see while in trial is not what the games about. The game for you will change drastically once you hit level cap. Once at level cap the game is about achievements gear mounts PvE PvP and just getting skilled at what you like to do. What can help is doing some 5 man dungeons and battlegrounds. However your character is still lacking most skills and doesn't feel like it will at cap. Level 40-70 will give you a much better idea on what things are about. Having said that some of the complaints here are true which is why I gave it an 8 instead of a 10. If we could only relive The Burning Crusade forever...,10,The classic WoW is simply the best MMO of all time a game never struck me so hard that i was litterly stopping my school just to play this game simply great MMO!,10,World of Warcraft. This game is just fantastic. When i started playing this game i did not have a clue what was happening however after a few hours everything came to me. It has a truly beautiful and massive world  filled with millions of other fellow gamer's. If you have never tried an MMO check this one out as it is the best  one going.,0,World of Warcraft is a grindy mess of an almost idle game with bad graphics that could easily be played on an N64. The game has literal hundreds of micro-transactions that you need in order to thrive in the game and if you don't get the overpriced level 90 character boost then you better be prepared to sacrifice hundreds of hours of your life probably thousands.

The game itself caused me to moan much too often at the "go across the entire country to talk to this dude" and "kill 83 of these things for a belt" quests that you need to complete in order to progress.,1,Fun for about 15 minutes. thats when you really start to realize youve been grinding for the last 5 levels and youll be grinding for 55 more.,0,BORING.. levelling up is very time consuming beginning quests can be overwhelming.. no payoff for team building.. cost$ is not worth the effort and replayablilty is dull...no mission markers or real assistance that could be helpful.

AVOID THIS GAME!!!,0,I loved it but now i lost all of my money on this shit and looked what happend to my life. THIS GAME IS LIFE DESTROYING DONT EVER PLAY THE GAME ANYTHING BUT THIS,2,A highly overrated super expensive game. Also sadly addicting. I have seen people get divorced over this game. Luckily I have not fallen victim of this game. I have quit playing and regret every second spent playing. If you want to be a normal gamer who is not an addict to some stupid online fad by all means do NOT break the piggy bank and buy this game!,0,There is a long story that reflects why i score this game so low. However you don't want to hear some guy ranting about how he 'hates wow and all that it stands for'. So let me shorten my reasons to a general feeling. Wow feels to me - like it was tweaked to perfection. The problem is that it's blizzard's perfection not ours. What is the one thing that binds you into not leaving a roomThere is a long story that reflects why i score this game so low. However you don't want to hear some guy ranting about how he 'hates wow and all that it stands for'. So let me shorten my reasons to a general feeling. Wow feels to me - like it was tweaked to perfection. The problem is that it's blizzard's perfection not ours. What is the one thing that binds you into not leaving a room for 3 hours? Not wanting to be disowned by players who will have their game affected by you leaving. Wow is designed to let the players dictate their own entrapment. Everything from the farm-like quests to the way people are tied to things - reflects blizzard planning how they can commit you to the game. The thing is people often don't see these cogs turning. And they believe the feeling of 'place' and 'community' is everything. And it is. In the real world. Don't get me wrong I am not against games or mmo's. I am against this very specific mmo. Because It's kind of evil.,6,Finally got around to playing this game when Blizzard began the free level 20 trial. I am frankly amazed that this is the game that supplanted Everquest. I can accept that an older game will not be as clean and polished as a newer game. However this game seems like it must have been outdated almost as soon as it was released.

I am frankly amazed that this is the game that supplanted Everquest. I can accept that an older game will not be as clean and polished as a newer game. However this game seems like it must have been outdated almost as soon as it was released. This game is neither as immersive as contemporaries Everquest and Ultima Online nor is it as ground-breaking. It offers few real character customization options redundant gameplay poor music sugary cartoony graphics and extremely unimaginative quests. PvP is not a clever interplay of positioning skills and counter-skills but rather a foregone conclusion based on build and gear. The one thing WoW seems to get right is that it is very giving with experience and loot allowing you to play relatively hassle free in those regards. I assume it also started the now well established trend of marking quest NPCs. Otherwise I really can not imagine what it is about this game other than the title that made it so popular. I am giving it a 6. It is certainly better than nothing at all but better games are out there now and they are sometimes even free to play.,2,This game gets a 2 from me.

The lone game out there that offer such a deep experience coupled with Blizzard's attention to perfect details.,7,Do not build an idea about WoW from a review : the game is simply too vast and it's unlikely any review will perfectly align with the way you play an MMORPG. How you play the game greatly affects how you enjoy the game. Most every facet of this game is double sided based purely on your personal desired intent with a MMORPG.

How you play the game greatly affects how you enjoy the game. Most every facet of this game is double sided based purely on your personal desired intent with a MMORPG. The graphics are somewhat dated but very reasonable on slow computers. The game is vast offering nearly countless hours of things to do but can be an enormous timesink. Over time much of the content becomes accessible but devalues the achievements of the hardcore gaming crowd. One thing that they certainly did get right is that the game itself is incredibly intuitive not requiring you to read the manual; It's easy to pick up and play for any skill level of gamer. One downside to WoW is that it is now the established standard of MMORPGs causing the Walmart effect on the market but it's gained its place for a reason.,5,[WOW] I tried playing this game in 2011.08 - 6 years after release: I did not get it I could not get it or I did not want to get it.

I come from DAoC and it had excellent PvP / RvR system apart from awful unbalanceness in the end but still Blizzard should've taken a lesson from DAoC how to do awesome PvP system and keep it interesting. Kids only go for this game because it has "Warcraft" in the name or they remember Blizzard from such a point'n'clickers as Diablo and it's easy to play.

World of Warcraft and it's numerous counterparts terrify me because I've seen the behavior of those addicted to it leading me to conclude that WoW is the ultimate example of exactly how video game(r)s can sometimes go too far. And these are clear implications on where the human race is undoubtedly headed: To a delusional fantasy facade covering a pit of isolation depression neglect and fear.

You can level up just by spamming dungeons if you wanted. The biggest problem i had with this game will always be the lack of real skill required i understand it's a video game and all but when your job endgame as a DD is the spam the number 1 2 3 4 on your keyboard over and over cuz that produces the best DPS thats just lame. If you didn't follow that guideline people got angry with you cuz the difference between 3000dps and 3050dps is apparently the end of the world. People were so obsessed with max everything swapping new gear cuz it gave you 2 more str when the old one was giving 250 and the new was giving 252. At one point wow had it and then they just let it slip away with patch after patch nerfing the last best class and then nerfing the new best one and with expansion after expansion adding more crap and diminishing the actual good things about the game.,2,I've played it for almost 2 years now and just quit. I've done it all: PVP Arena raiding grinding achievements topping DPS charts... and I'm quitting because I just can't stand the community anymore.

If you're a normal balanced adult you'll find that no matter how hard you try to shield yourself from it the sheer amount of HORRIBLE PEOPLE who play this game will drive you away. I like WoW. But it's just not feasible to play a game made for dishonest sociopaths. You can't truly enjoy PVP battlegrounds because almost everyone on your side is busy AFK'ing and complaining about people wanting to actually win the damn thing. Can't enjoy Arena either because you either lose to drooling sociopaths or team up with them and have to do as you're told. Can't enjoy raiding either because in a PuG you're either going to be cheated out of loot or are going to spend 6 hours racking up repair bills and never finish the damn thing. In a guild run you're going to face the same thing plus being harassed by the RL's pals GF or family members who think they deserve more than anyone for half the effort and who usually get away with it. If you decide to make your own guild everyone in it will fight amongst themselves making your life miserable. All that nastiness is fed by Blizzard with a silver spoon: Blizzard knows that the best addicts are the mean ones the ones who'll kill people for drug money so they'll bend what little "story" the game has to feed into that mentality (Trial of the Crusader is a fine example) along with jerk-rewarding loot rules that make ninja'ing not only accepted but expected. Blizzard has already announced Cataclysm to invest even MORE in that hate factor with heightened competitiveness inside guilds. Now you won't just have to grind for repair gold buff foods reputation mounts flasks gear get all the addons you can and scan Elitist Jerks every week for the latest changes to DPS rotations in your class to get a raiding spot you'll ALSO have to grind guild rep by doing quests and PVP so your Guild Leader can grab some nice stuff and give it to his brown nosing pals. No thanks.,4,If you haven't played Wow before you should definitely try it.

Since Cataclysm's release Wow has become the friendliest it has ever been to new players and at first it will be a lot of fun. The developers have a knack for taking the best aspects of other prominent MMOs and incorporating them into Wow. Starting in Wrath (possibly in TBC too though I didn't play for most of it) the game's target audience has gotten younger leading to streamlined gameplay and dumbed down repetitive mechanics. Too difficult to talk to other players and find a group? Add an automatic tool that does it for you! Too hard to pick talents? Lets reduce and simplify!The main issue with this is when you reach the maximum level (85) and discover that not only have you met no one in game to play with (after all who needs to befriend that exceptional tank/healer/DPS when you can just queue up and be antisocial?) but your choices are between sitting in the auction house waiting for your queue to pop and doing repetitive daily quests for reputation and gold Wow gets old pretty quickly. To be fair the devs are aware of the issues. In an effort to balance out the reduced human contact in finding dungeon groups and repetitive game play Cataclysm implemented guild levels to encourage players to join massive active guilds. Though I haven't tried any of the smaller tight-knit raiding guilds I have tried huge high-level ones and tiny brand new ones and it seems like you must choose between a guild that is as impersonal as Wow itself or a guild that can't get the XP to level up because no one wants to join a guild that is level 1.Finally regarding the player base: there are friendly players who are willing to help you and take the time to explain game and fight mechanics if you ask them and then there are elitists who will spew venom at you because they see you as an easier target than the tank. It is a mixed bag and unfortunately you take the good with the bad. tl;dr Starting out is fun but endgame is a grind. Don't stick around.,3,10 million subscribers can't be wrong can they?

It's up to you but my personal rating for this joke of a game is FAIL. 7 pre-TBC 3 after.,0,WARNING! This game is sort of like "what's the buzz?" when you first hear about it and then there's the DEMO. So after playing for 10 minutes you get hooked then you play for hours then days months years and finally you devote your life to this game. I'm telling you DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE! But overall the game play is awful repetitive WARNING! This game is sort of like "what's the buzz?" when you first hear about it and then there's the DEMO. So after playing for 10 minutes you get hooked then you play for hours then days months years and finally you devote your life to this game. I'm telling you DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE! But overall the game play is awful repetitive and you will find yourself doing the same quests again and again but with new monsters. Raids into dungeons aren't anything much just another RPG dungeon. But that's not all. Blizzard makes you buy the game AND the game CARDS and it's $30[?] for 2 months. At first that doesn't seem like much but it adds up. For a great RPG with lots of playability I recommend The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.,1,Ignore all the hype. Don't let all the Burning Crusade nonsense lure you into World of Warcraft. What's billed as an MMORPG is a dull repetitive unrewarding and downright irritating pile of bugs and other nasty things which I don't have the right words for yet. Here's a rundown of what's bad about it. 1. Horrible online community To those mature respectable Ignore all the hype. Don't let all the Burning Crusade nonsense lure you into World of Warcraft. What's billed as an MMORPG is a dull repetitive unrewarding and downright irritating pile of bugs and other nasty things which I don't have the right words for yet. Here's a rundown of what's bad about it. 1. Horrible online community To those mature respectable players out there I apologise this doesn't concern you. But the 90% or so others are pre-pubescent nerds whose idea of a good time is to jump up and down in front of your face request duels every 10 seconds and yell and spam chat channels ad-infinitum. 2. Pathetic Gameplay What was that quest again? Oh yeah same as the last one go to so-and-so kill so-and-so creatures come back to so-and-so and then deliver a letter to so-and-so telling so-and-so of the so-and-so's you've killed. So-and-so then tells you to go and talk to so-and-so who asks you to kill so-and-sos. Really World of Postman or World of Milkman would be a much better title for this game. For 60 levels you're basically an errand boy/girl. Totally repetitive infinitely irritating and not in the least bit enjoyable. 3. End-game OK now you're level 60. What now? Oh yeah more hours and hours and hours at a single sitting doing raids. How fun. Beats going outside and doing something normal doesn't it? 4. Techincal problems Lag. Lag. Disconnections. Lag. Servers down. Lag. Servers down. Disconnections. Disconnections. Lag. A bit more lag. Some more servers down. And some more lag. Then there's the multitude of bugs that range from weird FPS problems to BSOD on logging in. If you've ever expereinced any problems you'll know the standard reply to your queries will be either "check your firewall" or "check for viruses and make sure your drivers are up-to-date". Yeah like I never tried that. Very helpful replies from a company that's made billions in profit so far. 5. Exploits Bots. Chinese gold farmers. Some more bots. Oh hang on I've reached Tyr's Hand. AKA the Farming Region of Asia. Then there'll be some bots. Oh not to mention the random whispers says and yells advertising gold-selling sites. The only redeeimng fature of this game is the environment. They range from the cheesy Elwynn to the deserts of Tanaris to the frostbitten Winterspring and numeroous other interesting locales. it's such a pity it's contained in a game as frustrating as WoW. I'd love to see this game world in an offline single-player RPG or action adventure. So to anyone who hasn't played it yet - please don't.,6,I had an account for about 4 months altogether and at first I liked it. After playing for a while using multiple characters I got more familiar with the game. Then I realized to do anything worthwhile in the game you have to be high level wasting many hours of your life.

This game got boring and quick. If I could choose to have it again for half of the subscription fee for life I still would probably refuse. The game's overrated and either too complicated or not complicated enough. It feels in-depth but lacking. That may not make sense but it feels like that. My friends made fun of me for playing it it got boring and I had to pay money. Not worth it!,3,This game was brilliant ... 10 years ago. Today it is just a tire rehash of the same old button mashing grind. The graphics are terrible.

In it's early days it was outstanding a very significant game for the industry. But of course nowadays the same cannot be said from the point of view of other games today WoW has become so mediocre so banal and yesterday and that can only get worse over time. It did deserve Metacritic's 93 when it came out. But if it came out right now with all expansions and everything there is no way it would earn a 93 it would score far lower and that has nothing to do with graphics although the graphics are quite outdated at this point (and they were cartoony to begin with). I played for a couple years and it did have some great moments. But I can't rate this game very high for one reason: it's lasting impression on me. Games that I truly enjoy that are truly interesting they stick with me for a long time after I have stopped playing. The gameplay becomes a memory that I treasure to some degree that's what a good game does for me. WoW does the opposite; it leaves a nasty taste in your mouth and for many people unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. The game is designed to be as addictive as possible as opposed to intriguing or profound which is why for so many their relationship with WoW just gets worse and worse over time like all addictions. The gameplay is quite boring but the game does everything it can to get you to play through that. But for me gameplay that isn't even interesting will ruin the experience quite thoroughly. I don't care if the maps are nice and there are some fun guilds you can hang with if the gameplay itself sucks so does the game and no amount of lovely landscapes and achievements can obscure this fact from me. An evening of playing WoW becomes a disassociated blur peaks of fleeting highs scattered among oceans of boredom and a trance-like time-wasting stupor. The game was once great now I don't think it can die soon enough. My rating of a 7 is a compromise between what I would have rated it in it's early days (9) and what it deserves today (5).,1,I played it's a constant scam from being DC'd at the auctioneer only to re log and find whatever you were looking at to be marked up dramatically in the few moments it took to change IP and relogto being DC at every "point of interest" to being able to do entire dungeons unscathed then DC and not be able to survive it's soo obvious it's being controlled by blizzard when you send a ticketI played it's a constant scam from being DC'd at the auctioneer only to re log and find whatever you were looking at to be marked up dramatically in the few moments it took to change IP and relogto being DC at every "point of interest" to being able to do entire dungeons unscathed then DC and not be able to survive it's soo obvious it's being controlled by blizzard when you send a ticket I say good riddance to crookswow is a bunch of petty little cliques selling each other to the hacks each harborno use in playing go give ur money to a schoolyard bully you'll have twice as much fun,4,I absolutely love the World size environments and characters in this game.

The questing is pretty monotonous dungeons and raids are OK. But really what this game did was ruin MMOs in the sense that so many tried to emulate its structure.  Not an awful game a I would say a safe choice in for someone new to MMOs. This or runescape,2,Ok admins time to wake up and smell the roses this game is not worth it. The admins have to be the most inconsiderate impolite people I have ever met. They ignore almost all user import. I wanted to write a letter to Blizzard telling them how impolite they are.

And just to inform you I DONT CARE ABOUT BATTLEGROUNDS!!!! Id rather enjoy a lag free game. I tried to return it but they wouldnt take it so i did what i thought was best I snapped the cd in half and threw it out cancelled my subscription and vowed never to play it again. I gave it a two because it had some good features that i will not get into.,0,This game will ruin your life. It will addict you until all you do is play it. It takes your money and makes you think its worth it. Seriously if you play this game you are probably in denial. I'm not trying to be rude but if you play this more than an hour a day you should get a life. Honestly its for your own benefit.,6,Iâ,0,This game is THE worst MMO. Ever. There's massive patches being released every few months which means people playing on low-bandwidth can't play.

Also WoW addicts have pretty much no life and have nothing better to do than twiddle around on Azeroth talking to pedophiles. Also what scares me is that one guy had his account deleted and that drove him to suicide. SUICIDE. As in he took his own life. Another case is that this guy was a father who didnt feed his kid because he was busy staring at his level 60 night elf priest and his kid succumbed to starvation. If repetition horrible graphics and suicidal people make a good game also a $15-per month subscription fee then Blizzard just dropped the biggest turd on the gaming market Pass this and run far far away from it.,3,This game is SEVERELY overrated. The same premise (kill this obtain this etc.) gets very old. I have no idea why this game sells so much. Even as an MMO Minecraft TROUNCES this game.,0,This game turns you into a mindless drone intent on leveling up for hours upon hours a day (read: literally all day). It steals your friends from you. If you plan on not having a life this is the game for you!,0,worst. grind. ever. anyone who gives this a high rating has not played endgame long enough. nuff said.,0,no...just no. this game was good (in 2003) and deserved the high subscription fees because of lack of technology propelling the internet.

Been playing the game on and off since release and you still dont listen to the fanbase. Further you go down for maintenance say that you fixed something and hey! its not fixed.... Thank the makers that a real MMO in the form of SW:TOR came out. Hey Blizzard kiss my money goodbye!,0,This game has honestly ruined my life I started playing this game when i was 11 i'm now 19 yes i had a choice to ether live my life without this game or play the game but the game is so addicting and i could never stop playing it i never spent time with my family i never got any friends and i never got good education because the only thing i could think about is trying to be theThis game has honestly ruined my life I started playing this game when i was 11 i'm now 19 yes i had a choice to ether live my life without this game or play the game but the game is so addicting and i could never stop playing it i never spent time with my family i never got any friends and i never got good education because the only thing i could think about is trying to be the very best i could on this game in my opinion i wish it was never invented or even came about or i wish i never knew about it because it has really made me a total loser who sits at home and doesn't do anything i know i could have made some better choices but i didn't want to with this game because it always made me escape which is good for a short amount of time ii spent every last dime i got for the holidays on this game every last cent and now i look back and thing what the hell was i thinking because i absolutely hate this game and i have been saying that for several mounths but continued to play due to the fact i have no friends no job and i'm a total loser back than the game really was fun and entertaining it made a lot more since than it does now i can honestly say that i have been suspended so many times i have lost count 99% of the time it's the players on the game they are absolutely malicous and mean which leads me to the game masters who could give a rats ass about anybody else but themselves and think that they are all gods gift and i'm always the one who is out of line when 99% of the time the interaction with the players is bad. The game masters always make me feel like i'm the bad guy when to be honest i was just defending my own rights just defending myself using bad language yes the game masters just plane didn't care about me or how long i had been playing i'v spent over40.000$ on the products and the subscription alone they don't care about me or what i have to say i have been suspended for things other accounts did as well and the game masters never fix it never apologize i'm to this day truly dissapointed at the way the game has changed who i am as a person and the way i'm treated on it and by it's game masters if you have kids don't let them play this game because (warning) you won't ever see them again and i can promise you that no shopping no eating dinner with them no going out with them unless you can minimize that down to 1-2 times a week or if you wan't to keep them busy sure spent the $14.99 for a subscription OH and if your childs account gets hacked don't worry about it because the game masters will just tell them they can't do anything about it it's always the same bs and take it from someone who has played for 9 years 9! that's just reddiculous i wish i could do something i wish i could turn back time to when i first saw this game i never had gotten it if i knew this would be the outcome writing a review because the game masters don't care about me or what i have to say and i don't have the money to sue them so it's really just up to me to try and tell people the truth about the game i don't hate it i'm mostly just disapointed iv wasted my time my life and my family's money on it because i don't have any granted this game was an outlit but an outlit should not last 9 years. PLEASE if you are reading this don't let your child play this game it will ruin them and i'm not just ranting about that i mean it take it from someone who has nothing because of this game.,0,No one should play this game! It is a waste of time and once you hit it is unberable to play and just takes way to much time! And everyone hates hunters even though hunters are by far the hardest class to win with in PvP!,1,Warcraft hmm.. There is an easy way to put this game if you like to see numbers scroll up i guess this is for you.,6,What started off as an excellent game has in recent months gone down-hill. End goals are easily obtained through soloable means and less emphasis is placed on group effort. New end game boss fights have abilities and set-up that seem recycled. I have enjoyed the game and hope it will be worth giving a 9 in the future.,4,Even though I'm a huge Blizzard fan and I love basically all their games the only one that always flew under my radar was WoW I never liked MMO genre so I just ignored it back when it was released and never even tried it. Recently however there was a cross-game event to get a new hero for Hearthstone by leveling up a character in Wow to level 20 and to level 20 there is a StarterEven though I'm a huge Blizzard fan and I love basically all their games the only one that always flew under my radar was WoW I never liked MMO genre so I just ignored it back when it was released and never even tried it. Recently however there was a cross-game event to get a new hero for Hearthstone by leveling up a character in Wow to level 20 and to level 20 there is a Starter edition to try out for free so I just said to myself - why not let's do it it should be fun. But it really wasn't. I spent 3 days in this and I don't ever remember playing such a boring rpg with such generic quests. Maybe it was just my starting zone (Chose the beloved night elves) but the story never got interesting all quests are either fetch quests like go there get the 5 of this and bring it back or go there kill 6 of these and come back to me and it's going like this over and over. Combat is really bad there is no challenge no fluid combat mechanics if you are used to complex responsive combat systems such as Souls series this is a joke compared basically click on thing and wait until it's dead. The online element of other players running around the same world doing the same thing as you seemed more annoying than anything conflicting with my quests and so on. Yes the world is huge there are many different starting zones and I'm sure that back in the day this was a big thing that you could lost yourself for countless days but from today's point of view it really doesn't have much to offer. That said I definitely see the influence this game had the only other mmorpg i played was Guild Wars 2 and even though I think that was much better and fun game you can really see how much it drew from WoW the interface all the systems etc. and I'm sure this will be true for many others from this genre. But once again I realized that this genre is probably not for me and I'm gonna stick with good old RPGs with strong stories and interesting quests. 4/10,0,The definition of dropping the ball World of Warcraft is as of today the biggest misguided MMO I've ever seen. Class & race balances are shuffled around with the same kind of care and thought as a rabid wolf trying to eat a bloody stake and I don't mean any puns with that due to the ongoing balance right now having hunters be the masters of DPS burst and manouverability all at once.The definition of dropping the ball World of Warcraft is as of today the biggest misguided MMO I've ever seen.

I mean what is the appeal? Wheeee we run out do the same quest with a different name over and over and then Blizzard releases an expansion and we do it all over again!,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        warning you get herpes and dreads and glasses by playing this **** game bad controls boring boring  gameplayit look like it could be made in the 80`s,4,This game will absorb your life and make you completely severed from the outside world. If you are prepared to give up everything in your life from the moment you get this game then its OK at best. I suggest not even trying it.,6,WoW has had a great run these past few years. Although the game is getting stale now along with games such as Guild Wars 2 and The Old Republic on the horizon it is still an addicting and fun game though it is still tedious.

But then it gets repetitive (kill thiskill this to get these kill these so you can get this). In the end the only enjoyable part was pvp. In my humble opinnion if they put in a system thats lets you go strait to pvp (like guildwars has). I  think it would be much more enjoyable,4,Well I've played this game on a regular base not fanatic but frequently. While leveling it's an OK game although after setting the same DOT series for the thousanth time it get's a bit 'worn out'. Nevertheless the goal is clear: level-up! Then when you reach that top level it seems you just reached the beginning! Gear GearGEAR!! And now the trouble starts: Well I've played this game on a regular base not fanatic but frequently.

Lets see some of the flaws: 1. It takes forever to do anything including traveling and leveling up. 2. There is almost no exploring.

The graphics look cartoonish and the characters strangley shaped. 5. Most of the quests are boring and involve killing some monsters talking to someone or gathering some ingredients. 6. Classes are completely unbalanced: Paladins take a long time to level up and they suck while hunters level up twice as fast and dominate every other class. I could talk forever on how bad this game is. Its expensive too. If you were to play for 3 years you would spend $540. Trust me by the time you reach level 15 you will be bored to death. Get Oblivion or Morrowind instead.,10,I don't understand why people are giving this game a 0.

And battlegrounds do actually take skill-if you're doing warrior vs. warrior you'd better have some tricks up your sleeve.,10,I've been playing wow from a month after it released and i have never left it. this game is posable one of the best MMOs of all time. Id like to first address people who say its buggy yes it has bugs but blizzard does a really good job of fixing them. so drop it.

People who don't like the PVP You just got owned by people who have played longer worked harder know more about the system and have better gear than you QQ more nubs. Originality people the originality is that the game is brilliant. yes every game has its standard classes the archer the mage the fighter the monk the shapeshifter witch doctor rogue thats all part of the fantasy mmo deal. People who don't like the combat name a rpg that has better combat final fantasy sure as hell doesn't guild wars no its pretty much the same. Point being its the best MMORPG combat system. Time people. Yes WoW does take A LOT of time and it goes by a lot faster with friends its a multi player rpg find other players and play with them.,0,The game will not ruin your life unless your life is already susceptible to being ruined. I bought and subscribed to this game about a month after it came out. I only played it for about 2 days before I realized it was basically the worst MMORPG I've ever played. The graphics are abysmal. The sound has a low sample rate. The gameplay rips off basic elements of Korean MMORPGs (such as The game will not ruin your life unless your life is already susceptible to being ruined. I bought and subscribed to this game about a month after it came out. I only played it for about 2 days before I realized it was basically the worst MMORPG I've ever played. The graphics are abysmal. The sound has a low sample rate. The gameplay rips off basic elements of Korean MMORPGs (such as Lineage for example). The setting is like a parody of Warhammer but takes itself seriously. Overall the game is another cookie cutter product pushed out by Blizzard with clever marketing and timing resulting in its tasteless fanbase of hundreds of millions of people eating it up instantly. This means that if you work with other players in game (and you don't necessarily have to but would be a fool not to if you're subscribing for a paltry single player experience) then you will be playing with 11 year olds that don't know the difference between "your" and "you're" and think everything is "gay". If you become addicted to this game then there is truly something wrong with your life.,10,I started playing this game in August 2005 and played constantly until October 2008 then on and off spells in 2009. The second I started playing it I loved it more than any game I had ever played before. I played with two friends from school and two friends I met from playing other online games. We levelled up together and experienced great success in end-game PvE and PvP.

The second I started playing it I loved it more than any game I had ever played before. I played with two friends from school and two friends I met from playing other online games. We levelled up together and experienced great success in end-game PvE and PvP. I can't really think of a way to describe how highly I thought of this game when I was playing it. Even thinking back to it now it gives me a really warm nostalgic feeling in my heart and brings back great memories of truly fantastic epic adventures. Whether it was my first ever expedition to a dungeon or fighting tooth and nail in 2 day long 40 versus 40 battlegrounds.. Or even helping a friend with a grinding quest and having casual banter at the same time. It doesn't matter what it was it was all fun and the good memories severely outweigh the bad. The game was truly epic and was by far the most fun game I ever played. If you never got to experience classic World of Warcraft and started in one of the two expansion packs in a way I feel sorry for you because you missed out on something very very special. 10 / 10,10,There is something hardly ever mentioned in game reviews and nearly never given the credit it desereves--playability. There is something about the style of this game: the art the combat the quests the community--something that makes you want to keep playing it. Something that makes you never bored while playing it.

Something that tells you 6 months from now you'll know you'll still be playing it. That is what makes great games and in a genre where they rarely appear it is wonderful to finally have one.,10,Ok... i never played any other mmorps before.. with the exception of Earth and Beyonds 5 day free pass. look this game is just enthralling..

Savor the last free time you'll have for a while.,10,This Game not only has magnificent graphics but the game play is insane u have lots of charactor classes to chose from and u can level in solo games just as fast as in online multiplayer gameplay! I think every computer gamer sould have this game in there collection! the only bad part about this game is the anual monthly fee of 30$ per month!,10,Addictive too addictive. great world. There are a few problems with possible fixes but in the end looking at my current game hours that really doesn't matter too much. Don't listen to the people saying that it is slow and tedious and boring with using a skill once in awhile and "no chance for ambush." None of those statements are even close to remotely true.,10,Crack cocaine for MMORG fans (which I was not before this came out) and another truly superior Blizzard product. I did not like Warcraft III and expected very little from this but it has truly surpassed my expectations in every imaginable way. Incredibly complex and well-thought out countless hours of gaming. Will probably end many relationships. Hopefully not mine.,10,I find reviews like those from Palli N. to be amusing acting so condescending as if anyone would listen to them first because they proclaim to be players of "real" MMORPGs. All I can say is the World of Warcraft is just plain fun. I haven't played much else since I got it in February. Do I have some complaints? Only things that aren't the fault of the progammers like the lack I find reviews like those from Palli N. to be amusing acting so condescending as if anyone would listen to them first because they proclaim to be players of "real" MMORPGs. All I can say is the World of Warcraft is just plain fun. I haven't played much else since I got it in February. Do I have some complaints? Only things that aren't the fault of the progammers like the lack of balance in the classes (there are far more paladins and hunters than anything else) but then I could play as a priest or mage and the problem would be solved for me. What can say that hasn't been said? World of Warcraft is a great incredibly addicting game. I hadn't played the Warcraft strategy games before this and I got it with a bit of skepticism what with all the reviews proclaiming it to be theone MMORPG that anyone would love to play. It lives up to the hype.,10,Excellent game i would recomend to all my friends it can only get better and the guy who said about bliz fixin bugs well if you wait for a week they fixed all the important bugs very fast ofcourse a new game that has never been online before is going to have bugs i have bugs in making a simple calculater on basic so shut up you noob.,10,This game is the best online mutil player game so far that I have played. I have gotten to lvl 40 and then thats when things REALLY GET FUN! The game is always fun heck yeah but lvl 40 is fun getting a steed and all :D,10,This game will consume your soul. Be warned.,10,This is my first MMO. I am only level 35 dwarf hunter and right now this is the best game i have ever played. Given i have only played 1 rpg (Diablo II expansion) so my views are limmited. I like how detailed this game is with the profesions and all that fun stuff.

This is definitely the best game I have ever played.,10,This game is awesome can last you for ever well worth the £9 a month planty of stuff to do and its not all over at level 60 the game only just begins at 60.,1,7/10 gameplay 9/10 for graphics 0/10 for originality 0/10 for customer service 0/10 for online community 1/10 for "massive" multiplayerbility.,10,Love this game. So addicting and fun. Love to sit there and grind forever. So much to do quests to beat,10,WoW is a great MMORPG with an awesome art style and easy pick-up and play gameplay which is one of the reasons why 9 million people play it daily!,0,Terrible waste of time money and your life. Seriously the worst game ever made. Nothing original and nothing a rational minded gamer would like,10,I've played WoW since beta to the burning crusade.

WoW is unquestionably the best MMORPG out there and with over 10 million players the evidence is everywhere. Quests are challenging yet fun grinding is ok but unnecessary and if you have the time (I dont) instances are a blast. The Pvp system is also great battlegrounds are a lot of fun.

One of my favorite aspects of the game is that dying is not the end of the world as it is in other RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights and Diablo. The graphics although slightly cartoony are vivid and beautiful. The world is massive 3 continents now and soon to be a fourth (WOTLK). Money is hard to get but hey if it was too easy it would be boring. Very few glitches in this game the patches are only used to balance the classes (pretty much). Glitches are rare people are in general very nice and will help you around. All in all a great game. Well done blizzard.,10,This is quite simply the best game I've ever played. Read the reviews and you'll see that the people who have given it a score below 8 on here HAVE ALL BEEN PLAYING IT FOR YEARS!!!

Frankly if you've never tried the game you're missing out on one of the most thoroughly well crafted and immersive game experiences ever. After 5 years and seven million players the game is getting a little tired but that's quite a run! This is a must play.,10,The best game in the history of mankind (at least so far). And the bad reviews are just from either people that have a accumulated gameplay of 200 days (!) and are bored or that cant stand that a game played by masses (11 million ppl world wide according to the last count) is such a good game. If you will play just one game during your life make sure WoW is the game.,10,best MMORPG at the moment with thousands of fun questsdungeons millions of items and so on,10,This game was a total masterpiece of fun lore and story.

World in which you travel is absolutely huge- you can spend hours when travelling foot from point a to b. Enviroments have a great deal of variety so you won't get bored when travelling and the cartoonish art desing just beats out the competition. The lore of the game is in league in it's own too it fills actual books and the backround story and events are genuinely interesting. Music is epic. The gameplay is quite repetitive that i must confess but it's more hooking than anything i've ever played. You WILL get hooked to this game and propably waste couple of your years because of it. This is not the best game ever made but it's damn near close. Don't buy it. Don't waste your precious life.,6,GUYS WATCH OUT this game will totally ruin your life!! No matter what you do you will be unable to stop playing! Don't have a life?

Seriously if you let this game take away whatever you do else with your free time then you have serious issues and it's not just the game's fault. Also gameplay is pretty shallow. Not a lot of variety in what you do even after the level cap. Get a bunch of buds together and you can do raids but most of the fights follow the same cookie-cutter style. PvP is more like an RTS than anything else stack your team in your favor and hope the other guys don't have better items.,1,The people who play this game are absolutely horrible to new players. I tend to blame the software since there's so little to do late game that high level players feel they have nothing to do but gank low levels and treat their customer base poorly. Do not buy this game if you're a new player.,10,When playing beta one can see that this game is a real winner...its legendary.,10,hey everybody!

Honestly as a software game WoW is repetitive and slow paced. the combat system not matter how powerful you are is inflexible and unexciting. the graphic despite receving compliments everywhere is not really impressive to say the least in fact it looks like some thing 4 years ago. all the sounds including music are all very low quality. the sounds in-game from npcs and such are really not what Blizzard games are known for. I'm not really sure how to convince you about the quality of this game in the presence of so many good reviews (i'm not sure if i'm gonna trust reviews as much now). If you honestly find it a over 90 score game without being affected by other's opinions and the hype about it then you truly deserve to be cheated by this game. Very simply explained the game is MMORPG where producers aim to accomodate as many customers as they can to get as much cash as possible. to do that they must lower the quality for lousier computers. And the design of the game would be to be played for a long time but not necessary good they could just put in many tedious quests. in saying so you're actually paying for a sub quality game. =],10,In a year that has seen Far Cry Doom 3 Half Life 2 Halo 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 and more I'm surprised to find myself saying that this is the game of the year. It has an addictive quality that I have found in no other game. I can't remember when I was so anxious to get to my computer each night to jump into a game. The world is immense and the entire system of gameplay In a year that has seen Far Cry Doom 3 Half Life 2 Halo 2 Metal Gear Solid 3 and more I'm surprised to find myself saying that this is the game of the year. It has an addictive quality that I have found in no other game. I can't remember when I was so anxious to get to my computer each night to jump into a game. The world is immense and the entire system of gameplay incredibly deep. I have not yet begun to scratch the surface. It's simply mind-boggling to consider everything that Blizzard had to incorporate to make this game play like it does. Some reviewers have complained about lag but I started playing on day one and have not experienced a single technical problem. Despite the game's complexity it is so easy to just jump in and play with little or no preparation. The interface is very intuitive and the depth reveals itself to you througout the course of play. Of course for those who really want to delve into it there are plenty of resources available online and off. The sound is average at best and the graphics are slightly above average when including the quality of Blizzard's artwork and considering the breadth of the environment that must be displayed all at once. This game was my introduction to MMORPGs and now I'm hooked. If you try it I'm willing to bet you will be too.,10,I'm a hard core Star Wars Fan but I got suckered into playing this game by reviews...it's really fun and really well designed. Looking forward to higher level gameplay and expansions in the future. Kudos to Blizzard.,10,This game is the best in history of computer RPG. Blizzard will earn lots of gold:),10,I'm a die hard console gamer. Screw keyboards mouse ram system configurations and all the rest of the crap that goes along with being a computer gamer. That was my thought process up until May '05 and I played WoW. All I am going to say is ...If your a hardcore gamer...Love RPG's...then get this game and kiss your life goodbye.,10,Awesome game. The only thing I don't like is having to repair my stuff every time I die.,10,It doesn't get any better than this Blizzard crafts such gernious with each game they release.,10,Every head must bow every tongue must confess. This game is the greatest!!!,10,The best game ever.,10,This game is probably one of the best I have ever played I quit playing all of my other games it's that addicting.,10,WOW is without a doubt the best game I have ever experienced. Yes experienced. It's a game that transcends your wildest expectations while maintaining those expectations throughout. In a sense it's the perfect world. A world that you simply want to make your own.,10,Most polished and addictive MMO to have ever come out. If you don't believe it the fact that it's the most popular game ever at over 9million subscribers should be a sign.,10,World of WarCraft has taken massively multiplayer online games to a new plateau. Sure there are growing pains. At times you,10,I remember how extreamly eager i was to be able to play this game when it was about to be released. I played the game from may 2005 and for about two years it was the only game i played. It was almost the only game I had installed on my computer for 2 years! Now I'm broken I compare all new games to what WoW felt when I enjoyed it the most.

Nothing will ever make me feel that way about a game anymore.,4,I have to say that of all RPGs out there this may possibly be the one I hate the most. It seems to me that it takes the mindless droning of a sub-teenager to be able to sit glued to your computer screen repetitively killing the same monster over and over for hours on end to level up.... once. Also the game's lack of depth in terms of difficulty and what I call 'intelligence I have to say that of all RPGs out there this may possibly be the one I hate the most.

Also the game's lack of depth in terms of difficulty and what I call 'intelligence requirements' are rather low resulting in an experience that feels degrading. I must admit however that the game has a somewhat decent look to it and the graphics have a nice touch to them but are still sub-par in the current world of gaming. Overall I did not enjoy my experience with this game.,6,Don' tell me Wow is a good game... is a cliched RPG like many outhere. Most of u the doungeonsmonsters etc .. are super creative. Do you know a game called runescape? Worst graphics ever but this game in my opinion is the most creative rpg that i have ever seen. hmm anyways WoW is fine.,10,Best game I ever played. Better than all other (free) MMORPG's. It has good graphics and good quest.,10,Obviously the people who are rating this game o don't know what an MMORPG is this game is the biggest and most expansive an MMORPG will get.

It's not the same game anymore it's better. Blizzard keeps improving this game. The dungeon finder they added in 3.3 has revolutionized the game in my opinion. WoW is awesome. Read the quests suspend disbelief enjoy the stories that are told and play with friends and WoW will treat you just fine.,10,Best MMORPG on the market.,6,I played the beta for awhile... The game is a serious level treadmill. You attack a creature by clicking on it and you just let your character auto-attack occasionally using a special attack or spell by pressing a number. This boring form of gameplay may have cut it when EQ and DAoC came out but its starting to really decrease the quality of MMORPGs. The lag and lack of PVP is also I played the beta for awhile...

This boring form of gameplay may have cut it when EQ and DAoC came out but its starting to really decrease the quality of MMORPGs. The lag and lack of PVP is also disappointing. The PVP is there but there are no real rewards for it and the system is really quite stupid. When you're in enemy territory you have to wait for them to attack you and vice versa. This takes out any chance of ambush or surprise in battle. Not to mention there is no reward for actually defeating an enemy in PVP. It would be nice if you could maybe take their items ALA Ultima Online.,10,Honestly I have never given a 10 to a game before. This deserves it though. It is unbelievably huge easy to play and of course insanely fun to play. There are many many paths to chose and everyone is so friendly on it. This game has a replay value as good as your first character. I love this game!,7,I have played since the game came out. It still is good in its own way. There are still a diverse amount of quest you can do but will soon become repetitive and not much level grind if you quest and do instances. The endgame is debatable.

If your expecting something of Blizzard like more content be ready to be disappointed with there new obsession of making money from micro-transactions. There company has become a good personification of greed. With the new expansion coming out hopefully we  will see more dedication to the fun game they have created.,10,It was it is and it will be the best MMO ever... though is not as great as it was at its beginning.Some may say it's overrated but you have to accept there's not other game like this in the market and I don't think there will be.,10,Let's be honest: WoW is the best MMORPG ever made.  Some people will get jealous of that fact but 11 /million/ players are not wrong.

The highly addiction  time  consuming and hack and slash  will never stop my friend. And discovering new areas is more even more spend of hours. I highly recommend you to play this big world but keep in mind what i said at the beginning of this review.,6,I really think there is a good reason why this game has done so well over so many years it is a very solid and well made mmo.I think the only negative in my opionion is that the graphics and CC are pretty dated and lacking now.

I have found that in many newer mmos the difficulty in reaching level cap or in crafting or in making enough money to get important items just put me off and I left. This game has everything polished and is a very enjoyable and comfortable ride to the top. If you are unsure of whether to play this game or not do the free trial Im sure you will be hooked by the time you reach level 20 :),9,If I were to write a full review on this game it would be far past the 50000 character limit.

World of warcraft has over 11 million subscribers and IS the best MMO currently to ever be released of the date of this review. It set the bar for other MMO's that have went out of their way to copy a lot of the things that this game did well. I''ve been playing on and off for about 4 years now and haven't found a MMO that's on the same level as this game.,8,This game consumed my life for like 5 years 5 years ill never regain but then again its not a video games job to make sure you play it in moderation so i give it a kudos for being so fun and addicting that i literally couldn't stop playing it..if you're looking for a good game to get attatched to for a very long time this is a extremely good MMORPG to pick up but beware you might endThis game consumed my life for like 5 years 5 years ill never regain but then again its not a video games job to make sure you play it in moderation so i give it a kudos for being so fun and addicting that i literally couldn't stop playing it..if you're looking for a good game to get attatched to for a very long time this is a extremely good MMORPG to pick up but beware you might end up playing it alot more than you hoped sometimes this game can be a trap!,10,I just started playing WoW again after 5 years and the game i still just as addictive as it was back then. WoW outshines every other MMORPG out there. I've played them all Rift Tera GW2 GW Wildstar Elder Scrolls Online etc.  all of them were no where near WoW in terms of content and quality.I'm not trying to sell WoW here but I think it's better to pay a monthly subscriptionI just started playing WoW again after 5 years and the game i still just as addictive as it was back then. WoW outshines every other MMORPG out there. I've played them all Rift Tera GW2 GW Wildstar Elder Scrolls Online etc.  all of them were no where near WoW in terms of content and quality. I'm not trying to sell WoW here but I think it's better to pay a monthly subscription for a great game that never gets dry due to new content that gets released pretty frequently. Also many different aspects of PVP and PVE to keep you entertained for a long time. As mentioned before I would rather pay a monthly subscription for a great game instead of buying new games all the time because you finish them too fast or you've done everything it has to offer (looking at you GW2). Actually since I started playing WoW I've saved money because I haven't randomly bought new games all the time. Honestly I think WoW is just as good as when it launched. There have been made changes and some of them work better than others. But change needs to happen or else WoW would hit the F2P model as the other contenders which isn't quite as succesful as one might think due to low quality lack of content and pay to win models. (there are of course exceptions in some F2P games mostly MOBAs though like LoL Dota 2 SMITE etc.) WoW is still unbalanced some classes rule PVE and some classes rule PVP. Some classes rule one specific class and gets ruled by another. I don't think Blizzard will ever solve that issue but have any MMORPG ever solved that? I haven't seen it yet. But again if one class wouldn't rule the other and every class were equally good at almost everything - Then what seperates them what is the meaning of classes if they don't have certain strong advantages as well as disadvantages? My point is; it's still a great game I believe the price is high but it is justified through the amount of content and the quality it has which I haven't found in any other game yet counting both single-player titles as well as multi-player titles. 10/10 - I've not seen my girlfriend for weeks since I started playing. It has consumed EVERYTHING (hope you get the reference from the latest trailer) ;),10,WoW at it's best before it was destroyed by catering to bad players showering them with dumbed down mechanics and free epix. Sadly Blizzard fired most of their passionate designers and we are left with bunch of retards like Kalgan and Ghostcrawler. Bill Roper and Blizzard North are probably enjoying downfall of Actiblizz.,10,What a wonderful leather of assemblage Admiring the naming and activity you put into your diary and elaborated substance you substance !

The game used to be great and may still be for certain types of gamers. I personally have lost my interest in this game completely but I sure did have fun playing this for at least 5 years.,0,Buggy as **** Even after several patches still broken. You can glitch through terrain very easily. Each expansion means just more pointless grind where you don't get more powerful. All gear which isn't high level is worthless but you need it to get the end-game gear - fail. Traveling in this game is pathetic. An easy aggro system which is unchallenging. The crafting? So terrible. TimeBuggy as **** Even after several patches still broken. You can glitch through terrain very easily. Each expansion means just more pointless grind where you don't get more powerful.

So terrible. Time limits on some things collecting mats is either flying around for days or farming to buy them some crafting actually relies on high level dungeon drops so you cannot even make decent gear without joining a group and being a liability. Pots are entirely useless... Oh and people make chars on alliance and horde to pk you... world pk is useless and an obstruction to levelling if you are low or have no gear it is just annoying and you cannot do anything pk servers always die first. pkers are **** idiots who are angsty and flame you... pvp is only fun on equal grounds because it actually indicates skill. The only notable thing is the quest tracking system which still doesn't work properly and still has broken quests.,10,It's incredible seeing people hate this game so much... I know why...

This is game that stole more of my life than any other game - and for that I give 10.Yes it is not perfect but it is surely one of the best games ever made.,10,Classic: 9 TBC: 8 Wotlk: 7 Cata: 45. Vanilla WoW was an innovative change to the mmorpg world and for some people mmorpgs started here. Right now Cata is far from fun and they made the game pretty dull with that expansion. I wrote a big review there.,9,best mmo i have played and i have played alot of them. but this game even if it is old still is the best one and looks great when every expansion has upgraded its graphics.,10,World of Warcraft will always be known as the best MMO ever created. it was the first MMO that defined an entire genre of gaming and it'll always be known as "THAT MMO THAT DID IT ALL".,3,The expansion packs did not work with our group - i thought when i finally got past all the troubleshooting that I would enjoy the game but it got very boring very quickly.  When i meet face to face with players who love the game - i notice that one common fact is that they all haven't played anything else out there.,8,This game changed the gaming history. It has been so influencing inspiring and fascinating like few was and will be. Soundtrack is majestic colors and landscapes are delightful exploration is immersive. Millions of players and years of market sovereignty cannot lie.,3,A terrible MMO that has became a shadow of it's former self. It's become nothing more than a vessel to exploit the ignorant and uninformed with it's extortionate expansion prices and draconian subscription. Do yourself a favor and play TERA or Guild Wars 2 instead. They are cheaper have much better combat and infinitely better quests.,9,Got it on Black Friday in 2004. It was my favorite game that year. The subscription can get a bit pricey overtime and I like playing a ton of games of different genres so I only subscribed the first year. Picked it back up on 2014 10 years later.

And it was one of the most bad games I've ever played. The graphics were fine. But the story was very bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,5,World of Warcraft is in my opinion highly overrated. with the extremely unpayable price combined with playing against thousands of nerds and boring game play makes a after 20 hours of gameplay a thumbs down to blizzard. 18 dollars a month just isn't okay.,10,No matter how much you hate World of Warcraft. There simply isn't a better MMORPG anywhere to be found.I've been playing it since Vanilla (Classic WoW) and i've had my ups and downs with this game. But no matter how long I stay away from this game I always end up returning,0,Theysuck they don't do there job they let there report systems run on other players so that means if 2 people or more report you you're most likely going to get suspended even if it's false accession after playing this game for 9 years i realized i have no life... because of it and that it has destroyed relationships i wish i have never been introduced to this game for 1 the playersTheysuck they don't do there job they let there report systems run on other players so that means if 2 people or more report you you're most likely going to get suspended even if it's false accession after playing this game for 9 years i realized i have no life... because of it and that it has destroyed relationships i wish i have never been introduced to this game for 1 the players are all **** and you get harassed all the time constantly having to open tickets and report people for harassing me and it ending with me getting banned/suspended which is **** i'm currently suspended do to 2 players harassing me and i have just about had it with all of the **** period. i'm most likely going to cancel my member ship which i have done off and on throughout my 9 years of no respect from the game masters or the players. i highly do not recommend this game for kids parents please! don't let you're kids play this they will become addicted and they will never want to see you again my daughter plays it i can never get her to come out of her room anymore my daughter is constantly getting sexual messages from guys/girls on there several messages have been death threats from players... the game masters don't give a **** about your kid just your money. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD GAME!!!,5,This game still has a solid basis back from 2004. Despite all what has been done to this game later it still is ok more or less. Levelling is very accessible and fun at times. Group play is very accessible too.

As the years went some of the problems the game had were solved while other problems were created. Some things were improved such as the graphic engine or reducing the number of people required for raiding. As it is now however the game is unimmersive it's atmoshere is gone and the social dimension of it disappeared. Yet the world still has its beauty and under the layers of more recent additions the genius of the original is still to be felt. The game began as an RPG and headed towards the design of many Facebook games lately. It's very much about achievements and numbers rather than people persistent world and a story. As such it still appeal to many but the best times this game had are long gone. Be it shortly after Wrath of the Lich King expansion was released I would have given this 10 points. The same goes for the game as it was before this expansion. The breaking point for this game has been the first post-Ulduar patch 3.2. Both in terms of the growth of the player-base and in terms of game design decisions. With few exceptions the game has gone mostly downhill since then. Even though I have many precious memories from this game I would not recommend it in its current state. Even though it is a subscription based game a cash shop has made its way into the game which made the overal feeling even cheaper. Many elements of the current game make it mosly average but still worth playing if you just want to relax take it easy and if you like games based on collecting achievements and other things.,7,HOW I RATE: 10-9 score: perfect or near-perfect don't exist; 8 score: one of the best games ever.

Few others can even come close to matching it they merely have to settle for mimicking it.,8,World of Warcraft is a great MMORPG and addicting. This game is known for being extremely addicting which it is. It's just in nature to keep playing and playing because you want to keep leveling up to get more powerful and get better gear.

Even though it's addicting I do need a break from it sometimes because dungeons and quests can get repetitive especially quests that tell you to go kill a certain number of monsters which makes up about most of the quests. There's no story and I don't pay attention to the quests because there not at all compelling I just get the quest do it and then finish it without knowing the purpose of the quest. The combat is fun with lots of ways to play with just one class. PvP can be fun at lower levels but at higher levels it's not fun at all because characters are so unbalanced. PvP is based just on your level so you and the opponent can both be level 90 or what ever but there item level gear is ten times better that yours. PvP should be based on item level not player level. This game is pretty good and you should check it out.,8,Buy to play. Pay to play pay for expansions and from what i see lately pay to win (battle pets for $ and 80lvl for cash also).

I been playing since BC. As of now It is too boring and way too easy. I liked it back in the day when the game was challenging and it took your 3 or 5 months to get max lvl but still have lots to do afterwards. Wish this game would go back to the basics. I still love it but I miss the old style.,10,If you can't afford $15 US a month on gaming.

WoW is not just a regular game it is an entire new world with such a grown mature community. Yes there are a few trolls here and there in WoW but it is handled so well just a simple "mute this person" and move on with your life. I've been playing since launch and only had to encounter a few losers that I simply just muted+reported and never heard of again. Not to mention with all the money being sent to WoW they use it wisely ! They create expansion after expansion idea after idea yes a lot of people weren't happy with the MoP expansion so the they took in count of all the ideas people had and based it in the newest expansion. WoW is just a magnificant game its too much to write about...,10,After all those years Blizzard still got it. WoW might not be super innovative but it's still best MMO there is. Any other MMO isn't even close to the number of the possibilities there is in WoW. Graphics design might not be the best on the market but devs are constantly improving game visuals. For me it is and it will be for a long time the King of MMOs.,10,This is still an undenyable fenomenon that still gets support to this day and on 76m subscribers (and growing again) and if you compare that to most other MMORPGs out there that's...

It all gets super boring in the end at least for me. Let's not even talk about the subscription. I've already talked about it a bit in the beginning of this review but I feel like it's not enough.Let me bring up that the subscription you have to pay per month is pretty big. I mean 15 euros for a month of grinding and repetitive quests? Doesn't seem like that good of a deal to me.Seriously Blizzard why don't you actually work on making the game fun rather than inventing new methods to squeeze the most money out of your players. World of Warcraft should look up toGuild Wars 2.,10,Playing wow for 11 years.I quit this season.

This game was really good for the short time i could play it. i stopped playing as charterers really fast so i would not get bored of 1 type and waste my time even have downloading the game. I give this a 9001/10. lol,10,I'll do a short-ish review: At start it was good after Vanilla it started to go down. Especially after Mists of Pandaria. Blizzard has truly ran out of ideas. If it becomes F2P or they remove monthly fee I might continue playing it. (Yes I have played it!),10,So.. This game is the best MMORPG there is and will probably be for years to come.

Even though I tried a Wotlk private server and it was pretty cool but anyways. All I gotta say to the people trying to get back into the game or just start playing for the first time is that is is very addictive but the thing is that you will make friends you'll have fun you'll have a huge sense of achievement (especially when you start lvl cap content) I personally managed to keep in touch with  people who live hundreds of  miles away from me! It wasn't like we were just talking to a phone it's really like you have a person next to you. It's a second more exciting and adventurous world!! I recommend it to everyone that likes rpgs and that kind of fantasy games. There is one problem though. You won't really have time to get into other games because World of Warcraft will take a lot of your free time. I hope you found this review helpful and if you are still not convinced about the game just get a free starter account and try leveling up a couple of characters to level 20! I promise you will not be disappointed!,0,It's funny but i don't know for how long:it's the same soup always the same soup.My personal review is 65/10 i gave 0 to balance all that noob fanboys that everytime see Blizzard gave 10,10,Vanilla was one of the best expansion in World of Warcraft series.

All my other games are going on the shelf for the foreseeable future.,10,This game is utterly remarkable a truely extraordinary feat pulled off by Blizzard in the smoothest of fashions. Blizzard really is the BEST game developer yet their games have so much depth and following. Look at the way Starcraft is still one of the most popular games ever. This really is the best thing out of the hat. Amazing!,10,Best mmorpg out there. It's worth the monthly payment although the payment should still be half what it is..,10,World of warcraft is literally what it says it is its a world. Based on the popular video game Warcraft! The gameplay mechanics are very easy and very user freindly. The quests are really great and the social interaction is some of the best i have seen in my 20 years of gaming! This game is a must have for any fan of RP.. Truly incredible.,8,Certainly worth a try I've been playing WoW for 4 months now the game play improves a lot if you have a friend to help or play with (Recruit a Friend Google it). If you start off by yourself you may find some components of the game difficult to grasp unless you have played other MMO's I found support on the forums and other fan based websites. The PvP system is effective and Certainly worth a try I've been playing WoW for 4 months now the game play improves a lot if you have a friend to help or play with (Recruit a Friend Google it). If you start off by yourself you may find some components of the game difficult to grasp unless you have played other MMO's I found support on the forums and other fan based websites. The PvP system is effective and fun there are hardly any bugs if a bug does occur GM response is average and new content is constantly being rolled out. World of Warcraft give it a try. 8/10.,9,it deserves the hype. cynics are allowed thier views. They likely reached level 15 and felt bored. that is one of wows big problems. If you are playing solo it quickly loses its charm. one of the best games to play with friends. One of the best games to play to make friends. One of the worst games to play alone. worth your time if you can spare it and the money.World of warcraft: dont it deserves the hype. cynics are allowed thier views.

This will eat time which you will be feeding it with a spoon. with a little help from your friends: 91/100,9,Good stuff!!,10,Blizzard never fail to deliver thus this WILL set new standards for MMORPG. After reading reviews from users partisipating in the BETA test stage of the game in America and Europoe I will be very surprised if anyone is dissapointed!I will write a further review when I get hold of this gaming gem!,10,It's really plain and simple .... for someone who has grown up surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of different games over the years .... I've come to one conclusion. This is the best game of any type that I have ever had the privilege of playing. I won't bore on with why this is so .... just do yourself a favour and give it a try. WoW is obviously a labour of love that It's really plain and simple .... for someone who has grown up surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of different games over the years ....

WoW is obviously a labour of love that has finally come into fruition for Blizzard and it is well deserving of all of the praise from reviewers .... well done Blizzard!!! ....,10,The best immersive escapist game I've ever played. I might agree that there can be some repetitiveness and long stretches where you're just running from place to place I think it just adds to the realism of the environment.

Sometimes I just like to look around at all the unique and beautiful scenery they have created in this virtual world.,10,WOW!!,5,Well if i havent played Guild Wars too i would have given WoW a 9 cause this is the second best massive right now. But as you can guess it's lightyears behind the first truly best massive gameand that is Guild Wars. Blizzard you are so unlucky!,10,5.5 million players and counting. Pulled me away from BF2 and any other FPS game I was playing. It's hooked me my spouse her father my coworkers and my friends. The only consistent complaint I hear about the game is that you find yourself playing more than you would like to.,8,Having played a number of MMOs over the years i'd say WoW deserves the praise it gets. Whilst leveling to 60 (currently the highest level) it's a fun silly enjoyable process. as you start to head into your late 50s though if your not in a big guild you start to hit a problem... lack of content. Many of the 55+ content requires decent groups to achive anything meaningful Having played a number of MMOs over the years i'd say WoW deserves the praise it gets.

Many of the 55+ content requires decent groups to achive anything meaningful which can be a big problem for the more casual gamer. However i'd still say it's the best MMO on the market at the moment (Jun 06) and if you can get a decent bunch of people to play with worth the money.,6,yes i've read the article and understood what it's about but this is probably the best place for this.... WOW=MORE PLAYERSSLUGGISH PVP SYSTEM BUT ENJOYABLELONGER WAIT TIMESMONTHLY FEESERVERS DOWN ALOTMUST HAVE ALL GAME DISC TO INSTALL ON COMPUTER IF ON THE GOLEVEL GRINDING FOR 200+HOURS GUARUNTEEDLARGER WORLD THAN GUILD WARSCARTOON BASED GRAPHICS = notyes i've read the article and understood what it's about but this is probably the best place for this.... WOW=MORE PLAYERSSLUGGISH PVP SYSTEM BUT ENJOYABLELONGER WAIT TIMESMONTHLY FEESERVERS DOWN ALOTMUST HAVE ALL GAME DISC TO INSTALL ON COMPUTER IF ON THE GOLEVEL GRINDING FOR 200+HOURS GUARUNTEEDLARGER WORLD THAN GUILD WARSCARTOON BASED GRAPHICS = not amazing graphics GUILDWARS = LESS PEOPLEVERY SKILLFUL PVP SYSTEM VERY ENJOYABLENO OVERPOWERED PROFESSIONS unless opinionated by 5% or less of gw population compared to 60-70% of a Shaman or other overpowered character in WOWNO MONTHLY FEEMAX LVL IS ATTAINABLE IN A WEEK OR LESS.GAME CLIENT ID DOWNLOADABLE OFF MAIN SITE SO YOU CAN LOG ON EVEN AT A FRIENDS HOUSE OR ANYONE'S HOUSE WITH A COMPUTER.GRAPHICS ARE TRUELY AMAZING AS THEY ARE VERY LIFELIKE  vsWOW'S GRAPHICS WHICH PEOPLE WITH OUTDATED GRAPHICS CARDS THINK IS NICE IF YOU THINK WOW'S GRAPHICS ARE NICE YOU MIGHTAS WELL GO WATCH JUNGLEBOOK OR LITTLE MERMAID THEN CONTINUE TO SHOVE BOTH THOSE DVDS UP YOUR ASS FOR THE LONG HAUL GRINDING LVLS ON WOW. SIMPLY PUT GW>WOWNO MONTHLY FEENO FED EX MISSIONSNO SECOND LIFE REQUIRED (OR REPLACING OF YOUR LIFE)NO REACHING LVL 60 = FTL(FOR THE LOSS)NO REPETITIVENESSOH BTW WOW = 50 BUCKS INITIALLY + 15 X 12 COMING TO A GRAND TOTAL OF $230.00 A YEAR + 180.00 EACH YEAR AFTER vs GUILD WARS 50.00 AND IF COUNTING EXPANSIONS AN ADDITIONAL 50.00 PER YEAR.GUILD WARS: $50.00(100 if you choose to buy factions) VS WOW: $230.00AND FINALLY GUILD WARS HAS AN ACTUAL FUCKING STORY LINE WHICH IS SEMI-TRUE ABOUT WOW IF THAT EVEN. with all that said there is no argument for how WOW could be as good.  SERIOUSLY OWNED.,10,World of Warcraft will continue to be the gold standard for the MMO genre for years to come. Folks that do not enjoy the social and open ended aspects of MMO's may not enjoy this game however. Perhaps there should be a question up front that requests people who do not enjoy a certain genre do not vote on it.,8,Awesome game. The PvP was outstanding the quests were fun to play you can always find a group and the dungeons are some of the best. The reason I gave it an 8 was because it lacked player classes & the raiding/end game content isn't as good as other MMOs.,5,A game that does not end. Hangon that's not a game. So what is it you ask. Well I dunno. It steals your money and your life. I have seen friends play it for up to and beyond 16 hours a day. Unless you have absolutly no life then don't get this game. instead go out and buy C+C3 or HL2. Much more fun.,7,It's difficult to break a habit but after a solid year of playing it's finally happened. It's not that the game is wonderful it's extremely generic it's not that the game draws you back with high end graphics - it's looking rough round the edges though it's filled with chunky character.

It's not that the game is wonderful it's extremely generic it's not that the game draws you back with high end graphics - it's looking rough round the edges though it's filled with chunky character. The game is a tutorial for 69 levels and level 70 is simply a mass of clickables that amount to 10 hour dungeon dives for armour griding so it's not that the gameplay is particularly drawing. I really don't know what it is but some people just seem to be infected by it it drags you in and keeps a hold until you simply decide that you've had enough. I wouldn't even recommend trying it to be honest. As much fun as I had with it I've paid over £150 for the privilege.,10,Don't let it's detractors get you down. Superb graphics Easily the best I've ever seen in a no-loadscreen world of it's size along with the largest playerbase by far and a dev team that caters towards accessibility and you get the best MMO for a new MMO player and the best MMO for a senior player.,9,One of the best games on pc.,9,I was hooked inside 5 minutes after installing the game and creating a night elf druid. Several hours later I was still playing and forced myself to quit just so that I could eat and interact with the real world. But I found that WOW wouldn't release the grip that it had on me and I have never been drawn into a game world so completely as WOW. I only get to play for a few hours a I was hooked inside 5 minutes after installing the game and creating a night elf druid. Several hours later I was still playing and forced myself to quit just so that I could eat and interact with the real world. But I found that WOW wouldn't release the grip that it had on me and I have never been drawn into a game world so completely as WOW. I only get to play for a few hours a week and that is mostly solo play trying to get the best weapons and amour available without needing to do high level raid dungeons or heroic instances. Even so I still love to play in this immersive world even when I know that all I will be doing for the next 2 hours is killing the same creatures over and over in the attempt to gather loot to cash in for reputation points. It's the fact that there is always something else to aim for in the game that keeps me coming back for more.,10,Mmm...candy...I played the beta version and it was so yammy.,10,Blizzard is one of the best quality game makers out there. Even though the game wasn't completed at launch it's still amazing. Blizzard is always changing things in there games to adjust balance issues and to add more fun and challenging aspects. It's harder to judge this game right out of the box because in the end it'll be the most spectacular mmorpg to date.,8,I would have given a ten except that I feel the game magic is too short time length and way to limited. The monsters do the "old" sneak up on you from behind all the time while you are fighting the first. The graveyards are always furthest from the gang up on you die all the time areas where you level up at. I dislike how it looks like the game is going to go all desert wastelands and I would have given a ten except that I feel the game magic is too short time length and way to limited.

The graveyards are always furthest from the gang up on you die all the time areas where you level up at. I dislike how it looks like the game is going to go all desert wastelands and sewers like the "old" everquest. I would like to see a bit more dungeons that are a lot less twisty turny get you lost with twelve different levels on weird slopes. The graphics look good and I like the simple quest structure.,10,It's quite good.,6,I honestly don't get it. This one does not deserve the tag of RPG. Want to powergame sure go ahead but it wont last very long. Want to roleplay go somewhere else. Where is the devirsity? Where is the options? Roleplaying is not only leveling your character it is living it. Sure the world looks magnificent but come on everybody living in it look alike.,10,Another preposterously addictive Blizzard triumph. GOOD: Just about everything. Honestly. Instance dungeons are my favorite. These become available to you around level 20 and there is a new one roughly every five levels. They require good teamwork and offer some great rewards. Every one I've played is a blast. BAD: Lots of time to hit level cap. I estimate the average player needs Another preposterously addictive Blizzard triumph. GOOD: Just about everything. Honestly. Instance dungeons are my favorite. These become available to you around level 20 and there is a new one roughly every five levels. They require good teamwork and offer some great rewards. Every one I've played is a blast. BAD: Lots of time to hit level cap. I estimate the average player needs to invest about 250-300 hours to hit top level. I know the WOW community is divided on this issue but it's just too much time for me. Levels can become somewhat repetitive but this is par for the MMORPG course and WOW does their best to keep it interesting. When bored run an instance! OVERALL: Another glorious time sink from Blizzard. Buy it. Live it.,10,I love this game. If I weren't at work now I would have no time to write this review as I would be home playing! To all those who gave this game a bad review all I can say is you get out of this game what you put into it. To all those who gave this game a good review all I can say is you get out of this game what you put into it. And of course playing with others makes a big I love this game.

To all those who gave this game a good review all I can say is you get out of this game what you put into it. And of course playing with others makes a big difference. I personally don't get anything out of playing solo in a massively multiplayer game. Take the time to meet people/characters and develop your friends list so that you always have company while you're playing. Even if you're not adventuring together chatting is still "company" while you play solo. Lose yourself in the world and play your character. You don't have to be in character all the time if at all. But it helps to read up on the history of the world to read the quests you're given to read what the NPCs have to say. Then when you explore and find a new area you will not only be stunned by the amazing graphics and surreality. You will also be able to say "Wow this is where the Dark Portal from Warcraft 1 was opened allowing the orcs access to Azeroth." Or "I'm standing on the spot where the demon Mannoroth was finally slain by the now shattered alliance of humans elves trolls and orcs." You'll love the game and your character. Make sure you read up on the classes and professions so you can decide beforehand what you will enjoy playing. Or you can do what I did and create characters with different combinations of classes and professions and play who you want when you want. :) That's why I love the game. Your results may vary. But probably not.,10,If i can vote this game by infinite i would. This game is like a drug. My brother has it and once he let me play it i got hooked so bad all my grades in school went down. This is the best game out or ever.,5,Frankly its not the game that's to bad (damn quests are all the same instances are okay though)... it's Blizzard. They meaning the people currently working there have ruined this game for me. Basically cold responses to complaints cryptic and almost always unfulfilled promises and simple stupidity are the bane of this company. More later... now: I rolled a paladin Frankly its not the game that's to bad (damn quests are all the same instances are okay though)... it's Blizzard. They meaning the people currently working there have ruined this game for me. Basically cold responses to complaints cryptic and almost always unfulfilled promises and simple stupidity are the bane of this company. More later... now: I rolled a paladin because I had heard they were a great class I hit 40 and all hell broke loose. Blizzard ripped out the class' guts and let them rot in the sun! Still I continued to play until I hit the level cap - 60. I was then redueced to a mobile potion practically useless in any situation. I rolled a Warrior and found out that I had drunk the Kool-Aid... this game blew I found out by level 20 this time. While this happened I noticed the same thing slowly happening to mages and hunters. Why now? Blizzard simply can't focus. First of there's still horrible lag and Blizzard doesn't care. They're to concerned about making Shamen and Rogues unbeatable (yea they all play em find a Blizzard rep who doesn't) and getting Battlegrounds up and running (it's capture the f--king flag!). Fix this horrible problem we're tired of dying due to LAG! Secondly they have they're own agenda it seems they focus on what they want to do rather than what the people want... BS. Never once have I seen a Blizzard rep actually impliment a fan suggestion in a fan supported game. Thirdly the game is repetative and boring without any sense of continuity or direction. It boils down to who can hit 60 the quickest and who has that uber armor. THATS IT! It's not about fun I eventually found myself feeling dissatisfied with my own gaming once I saw every other paladin in Lightforge (you'll find out...). So basically this game is flawed horribly because of the lack of concern coming from the higherups. It seems they got so carried away in presenting Battlegrounds and amazing loot that they stopped caring about originality and fun... By the way why do I have to pay $13 bucks a month? Time to cancel... To think a month ago I would have given this game a 8 or higher... HA. PS: Guild Wars is probably the best option for people looking for FUN.,7,Quite a god game but way toooo less support (ingame and forum). The bugs also disappoint very much cause the game is now almost 2 years old and there are bugs from the beginning without being fixed.,10,This game is probably one of the best I have ever played I quit playing all of my other games it's that addicting.,5,no I'm not playing the game anymore becuase of 1. poor customer service nice but ineffectual game masters - who's replies seem to be(4 out of 5 replies) either "not our problem" or "it's your own fault you must have modified the game" 2. time killing watses of time heavily padded game play - lot's of time spent waiting for respawns/ppl to arrive/transport - basically no I'm not playing the game anymore becuase of 1. poor customer service nice but ineffectual game masters - who's replies seem to be(4 out of 5 replies) either "not our problem" or "it's your own fault you must have modified the game" 2. time killing watses of time heavily padded game play - lot's of time spent waiting for respawns/ppl to arrive/transport - basically just seems to keep you on-line rather than in action 3. lack of an equal and "fair" design focus too much focus on carebear PvE - as many people have pointed out PvE is the most boring and repetitive aspect of the game but there's no way to just play PvP all the time - while you can level up and get nice rewards either through reputation or rank from PvP yopu CAN'T skill up - you have to grind in PvE to gain more skill 4. confused and poor new ideas Lack of clear direction - yes they have an expansion pack coming out but they come up with lame ideas like PvP in remote zones for short term rewards(buffs to your character rather than loot or skill) - basically NO-ONE wants to play sand castles 5. lack of direction for new player character creation Unless you check the third party websites you'll very likely end up as an alliance human character - which means double the wait time for PvP becuase of the the 2:1 or more ratio of Alliance to Horde characters There's no character limits so there are a lot of one type of character(warriors) and very few of others(priests/shamans) which means trying to set traditional groups up (tank dps dps hunter healer) is difficult when everyone is trying for the same healers in that bracket 6. weak/ineffectual grifing policies Small server size so you can end up with the same griefers every time you play - yes there is an ignore feature and you can report them (see the first part) but you only have a limited number of ignore slots while griefers can effectively just create a different character to get around the ignores 7. no focus on casual players No diminishing returns policy as promised - basically if you want to you could play the game indefinitely (as many people do by botting with a macro) - this is a disadvantage for casuals but does mean that there's an incentive to stay on as long as possible - social life? friends? recreation time? 8. small population size The small server size does mean that they can fill up rapidly resulting in queue times and also a single person can dominate the auction house easiyl(i know i've done it - grinding is over-rated) 9. Lag can be very high servers lagging badly (especially at peak times on older servers) and one time events (AQ gates) crashing the server every time it happens - i suppose it's easier to pay someone to reboot than to fix/upgrade the server anyway that's pretty much it - thx for listening,10,I have never played a Warcraft game before. My friend told me to get a copy of this game and I did. I do not regret spending the money on this game. This is the most polished user friendly and just plain fun MMO. Every day is a new adventure in the World of Warcraft and once you step into the gorgeous world of Azeroth you will never want to leave.,10,Look this game isn't for everyone. If something constantly needs to be happening for you then you might find yourself frustrated at times with the pace. But folk it is a roleplaying game. It is not supposed to be non-stop action. It's supposed to make you work and think and the rewards you earn (levels equipment reputation) are hard earned. If you're a gamer that needs Look this game isn't for everyone.

If you're a gamer that needs instant gratification from the secon you log on until you shut down then go elsewhere. I've only had the game for a month so I can't speak as to how buggy it was when it was first released. But I have had nearly 0 technical problems. I haven't had a need to contact customer support or the GM's so I can't tell you how good their service is. But if I don't need to talk to them the why should I care? Last word. If you like RPG's this game is definitely for you. Period.,10,Eow I'm really surprised by all these negative views I've not been playing WoW for a long time but I really really enjoy it there's sh.t tons of stuff to do the sheer size of the world and the seamless way it is presented are incredibly impressive the challenge in any game like this is always going to be dependent on your level and the way you setup you character.

I'm really really enjoying it so far. Much better than any old school MMORPG I've played in the past where the ideas are the same but not touching on this kind of fun presentation and what not. The negative reviews speak for themselves really in the awful spelling and grammar used in them.,9,I think this game is great. CM maybe MMO's aren't just for you but your statement is a gross oversimplification. And Arenas in WoW actually do take skill... not any random guy can go in with his buddy and get his team to a 2100 rating. And raiding and coordinating 25 or 40 people to do their jobs correctly is no walk in the park either.,9,WoW is just simply great fun. Amazingly polished well balanced and packed full of stuff to do. It's the most played MMO in the world (by a LONG way) for good reason - it caters for everyone not just the gamer who plays it 12 hours a day. Although if you do play it that much.. you'll find it's a long time before you run out of entertainment. You can pick up the game for WoW is just simply great fun.

You can pick up the game for £7 in shops now (with 30 days free play) which is about the monthly subscription. Considering most AAA games cost £35+ these days and last less than a month that's an absolute steal.,5,Fun boring varied repetitive vast cramped social lonesome cool stupid short and long. Pick whichever you want and there'll be people there to back you up.,9,Best MMORPG ever...which isnt saying much as basically all of those games are bad bt still to make one game ithat is enjoyable for more than phat lewts and that lvl up ding is an accomplishment worthy of being reconized. now can i have back thos 5 months i spent on you?,5,Played this game since release yet still cannot say many positive things about it in its current state. For starters the leveling process is magnificent probably the only really good thing about the game these days. It has been recently changed to minimize the time needed to achieve max level (from level 1) though the game starts to get old once you get there as the only options you Played this game since release yet still cannot say many positive things about it in its current state. For starters the leveling process is magnificent probably the only really good thing about the game these days. It has been recently changed to minimize the time needed to achieve max level (from level 1) though the game starts to get old once you get there as the only options you have for game play are to either grind honor points or arena points (which is a currency used to buy weapons and armor) in a PvP environment grind the (quite literally) same quests each day or find a guild willing to accommodate you in their raiding endeavors. It wasn't always this lackluster though. Previously WoW focused largely on end-game PvE encounters (raids) and thus gave a wealth of development time to these areas of the game. However the focus has since shifted to a very PvP oriented world namely the addition of the arena system and has left the glory days of World of Warcraft in the dust. The community is not at all receptive to new members nor will it look kindly upon any form of role playing (even on specially tagged RP realms). All in all don't come to World of Warcraft in search of a good friendly group of dungeon crawlers - those days are sadly long gone.,9,This is a VERY entertaining game! The grahpics aren't that good but it is an MMO so Blizzard did have quite a bit more to worry about than graphics. The game is gigantic yet there is always somebody playing near you. You can make the game whatever you want to make it too. Just because it's an MMO doesn't mean that you can't play by yourself. I would certainly This is a VERY entertaining game!

Also if you aren't sure about buying it you can just go to the site and download the free 10 day trial.,9,If you think your graphics suck then obviously you need to fix your screen resolution. Amazing depth and gameplay. There are simply hundreds of different ways you can play this game.,10,This game is just Outstanding! Is awesome to play in solo mode but if you get company it just rocks like hell. The best RPG ever.,10,Hate this game too addictive. Should come with a health warning.,9,World of Warcraft is Blizzard Entertainment's entry into the MMORPG market. It has dominated Western and European markets and holds a very high market share even with the addition of several new next generation MMORPGs. It currently has two expansions to it which increase the maximum level and provide new continents to explore. As with any MMORPG there is periods of grinding and World of Warcraft is Blizzard Entertainment's entry into the MMORPG market.

It currently has two expansions to it which increase the maximum level and provide new continents to explore. As with any MMORPG there is periods of grinding and every class in this game can solo group or join a 25-man raid some classes are a little easier for soloing and some are more desired in group settings but it is all relative. I really enjoy this game and play several hours a week. (mostly to play with the server economics and play with the auction hall as I control around 10% of my server market).,8,Why do all of the bad user reviews say that it will take up your life while also being the worst game that you've ever played? anyways Wow is a really good game. try to play with friends or even strangers that you find online because soloing is kinda depressing.

As you've probably heard there's a huge time commitment. talking to some of my friends about it getting to the maximum level is somewhat of a tutorial for some of the Pvp and arenas. if you have nothing better to do and some friends to help you with the ride you can't go wrong with Wow. $15 is a great deal too.,9,If you don't like the game don't find it fun and think it's pointless crap don't play it. You have a choice you know. As far as paying to play it goes why don't you just get a job? People who enjoy MMOs and RPGs play it and love it people who can't appreciate more complexity than "point gun pull trigger repeat!" can go play Halo/GOW/Your shooter here.

Also please rate it at least a 1. I don't think a game that deserves a 0 could ever get 11million+ people paying $15 a month.,9,World of Warcraft has become less of a game and more of a second life. Its a joke but it is true that it sort of takes over your life. Meta-anylization of the game and it's mechanics would lead one to think that its not even worth their time and the fact that no one actually reads quest descriptions (other than the goals) leads to an almost non-existant stoyline. However what the World of Warcraft has become less of a game and more of a second life. Its a joke but it is true that it sort of takes over your life. Meta-anylization of the game and it's mechanics would lead one to think that its not even worth their time and the fact that no one actually reads quest descriptions (other than the goals) leads to an almost non-existant stoyline. However what the game lacks in conventional terms it makes up for in addictiveness. You will find yourself wondering all day whether that item sold on the auction house or when you can take on that dungeon thats been rearing it's ugly head at you. Worth buying and worth paying for on a monthly basis. My only beef is that it lacks large servers. You're looking at about 5000 people per server as opposed to the monstrosity that is EVE online.(which is a single server with about 30000 some people on it). If anything I would love to see the creators bring a few servers together to populate it more.,7,This is a very good MMORPG but i'm afraid the gameplay has stopped being "new".

WOW has nothing too special except the big userbase but all-in it's a fun game.,9,It's accessable it's addicting it's beautiful without being a resource hog and it's most of all just a lot of fun. A couple bugs I've run into keep it from being perfect but with this kind of game perfection may still be achievable with the right patches. Simply awesome.,6,WoW may have been a 10 at release although most beta testers would tell you differently; however now it's hard to argue that this game is anything beyond mediocre to tepid. Many of it's alluring features have fallen through just like the guild houses that EQ promised and never delivered for 5+ years. What's most harrowing is that WoW was billed as the EQ-killer because WoW may have been a 10 at release although most beta testers would tell you differently; however now it's hard to argue that this game is anything beyond mediocre to tepid. Many of it's alluring features have fallen through just like the guild houses that EQ promised and never delivered for 5+ years. What's most harrowing is that WoW was billed as the EQ-killer because it had methods that prevented powergaming from completely overshadowing the casual gamer who can invest 1-2 hours per night after they come home from work. What we have seen though is that the playing field between powergamers and casual gamers (who coincidentally pay the same price to play) is still very uneven. While anyone would agree that time should somehow correlate to "success" most people would also agree that one of EQ's biggest failures was the fact that you had to invest so much time to get things done. WoW is headed down the very same path instead of veering on a course which is less focused on time investment and more focused on gameplay. For example try getting exalted faction with Thorium Brotherhood Timbermaw Furbolgs Argent Dawn Zanzalar Tribe etc. and you will find that with precious few exceptions there is no way that someone who plays 4 hours per day will ever come close to half the "success" that someone who plays 8 hours per day will. With the release of Guild Wars WoW may be the fad but it's quite obvious that someone somewhere sat down and thought long and hard about how to make a game where thought and strategy account for more success than time played and where the exp curve is more linear than exponential - meaning that going from level 19-20 takes approximately the same time as going from level 4-5 unlike WoW where levels 1-20 can be done in 1 in-game day and 21-60 take an additional 7-8 in-game days for a powergamer 15-20 for a casual gamer.,9,This is a well made game. Can get a little reptitive but hell thats MMORPG's for you. Only drawback that i see is the modelling. I find the models quite basic and quite childish. This game needs a bit of blood and a storylines that freak you out. It needs to grow up a little. Other then that its a really well made game.,9,This game has only 1 bad thing about it you sometimes feel like you have nothing to do after completing a goal like a big quest but very fun and great online also interesting.,6,Great game for the first month or two but after awhile you realise this is a MMO on easymode you can reach end game without much effort and once you get there you're expected almost to devote 4 hours+ of your time for a single item otherwise your character is uselss in every aspect of the game which is annoying if you picked up the game for an easy-going ride.

The game has a huge fanbase of ex-counter-strike players who are completey new to the genre which explains why its so successful and getting such rave reviews. This game has to be one of the best games I've played on the PC however and the artwork in it is great.,8,I partially agree with William L. Yes it is true that they short cahnge people who don't play 24/7.

All the GOOD features are reserved for the high levels ok there are a few quests early on but after level 10 its just a grind fest that slowly gets more and more tedious until you get to level 30 when you will either: A. Realise your wasting your life uninstall the game cancel your account and warn everyone about this game. OR B. Keep playing until your skin turns green from sunlight depravation then realise that your dog has died and you should have probably fed it instead of playing the game. But seriously this game is waste of your money and your life dont try it youll get hooked but after seeing the light you will look back and ask: "How did i find a reason to pay for that piece of poo?",1,Horrible absolutely horrible customer service/game master department.

Normally this wouldn't be a problem but Blizzard only creates new contents for the higher levels. so re rolling a character can get boring and repetitive. other than that good work!,2,Totally overrated. Blizzard is one of my favourite companies however this monstrosity of an MMO will leave you disappointed dispite all the hype.

What new brings WoW is the amazing amount of kids that make PUGS look like the worst thing to do (you know doing PUGS in regular mmo's IS possible). End-Game after BC looks like farming reputation for 15 different factions that each give one item. The challenge in the game is just an illusion. Illusion made by kids that didn't know there should be a tank and a healer in a group. Old-school MMORPG players had never problems with all the raid content in WoW.

Mostly because they realized that there is so many other beter MMORPG out there.,5,This game lacks any in-depthness at all...if you enjoy easy mode then Play WoW.,9,Yeah...all you people may be hating on WoW..but thats just because half your player base left and came over to WoW...WoW broke MMO records and is the #1 MMO to date...EVER.

Plain and simple the game is terrible don't waste your money life and lucky lady.,6,As much as it is thrilling and fun at starting levels (where majority of reviewers will stay) it's so boring and repetitive at top level where it tries to keep players busy (and paying) with the same content again and again and again...

The story immersion and reward system is absolute crack for the brain getting new spells every other level getting items and gold for every quest.. the story immerison is so great due to the whole warcraft storyline and also the variety of environments.. it also takes a lot of literary aspects from famous stories into it making t even more interesting.. for example the Kurzen Mystery questline is clearly based off the Heart of Darkness and its inspired movie Apocalypse Now.. Just a great game and I wouldn't be surprised if I started playing again for my 4th or so time when the next expansion is released.,2,I will give this game a 2 because when I first played it I was in awe of the vastness of the game.  But as I leveled up I began to realize how repetitive it was.  I began to grow bored of it and eventually canceled my account.  Wow was fun but the monthly fee takes my vote from a 7 to a 1.

It's redundant repetitive (hehe) and nothing that isn't every other MMORPG except for anyone can play it. It's simplistic lacking strategy or skill those who play will find themselves mistaking their characters effectiveness at "pwning" as reaffirmation of their own abilities unfortunately this is a fallacy. I agree with G W in that people who are addicted are forced into saying they love it because otherwise dissonance would settle due to the conflicting ideas of "this is a bad game" and "I play this game". On the other hand we all have our terrible guilty pleasure of a game (mine is Samurai Warriors) that we love accepting that the game is severely lacking in challenge. Plus some people need to be validated as human beings and the reaffirmation that they can succeed merely by investing an amount of time sufficient to level up is needed for maintaining their self esteem (no offense to said people). In summary the game fills or creates a compulsive niche in many peoples psychology such that the true quality of the game becomes obscured and insignificant in comparison to attaining one more fix... one more level. I consider this less a game and more a money grab that abusing a dependence.,3,I couldnt get addicted. Wasnt too inspiring the contols are wierded out the graphics arent great and by all means if you are playing Final Fantasy XI just stick to it because this game offers nothing jaw dropping. Im nice enough to give it a 3.

It's a bloody MMORPG and I'm sure none of you can find an MMORPG with so intense combat system and with such a huge world.

It'd lag out 90% of players. And the gameplay; people who say "it's nothing but running in circles and clicking on monsters". Wrong. This is basically what you CHOOSE to do but I tell you quests are anough to level you up easily plus they're entertaining (Atleast more entertaining than grinding. Ironically though Runescape probably the most hated MMORPG out there has the best quests out of all MMO's i've ever played but they're not as rewarding. Way more entertaining however.). And if we really do choose the grinding option it DEFINITELY is not "click a monster and wait it for to die". WoW has so much special abilities to use and if you even try to kill some monster the same level as you without using abilities you'd fall down dead before you even notice. And at higher levels when raids come in it really does become interesting. I'm not too much into MMORPG but out of all MMO's this is the best one yet. I give it a 9/10.,9,I have to give this game a nine even though I quit and don't really wish to go back. (Though sometimes I think about it). The game is absolutely addicting.

I know it's the cool thing to hate on WoW and I know I've done it before but it's a groundbreaking game. It is the best MMO to date without a doubt is clearly the most successful and offers the most substance. The game feels solid and it feels like you're in it. I rarely get addicted to MMOs on a large scale because I feel too detached from the game itself and they all feel a bit shallow. However WoW managed to pull me in and keep me playing for a little over two and a half years. The graphics while very dated now are still colorful and full of personality. There's just something about Blizzard's art and atmosphere that manages to draw me and make me disappointed with every other game of its type a lot because of this. I won't say it does everything right but it offers so much that it's really hard to be disappointed. There's something for everyone and it's a very good game in its respect. I suppose I'm disappointed with Blizzard for some of the choices they've made and how they seem to have become more focused on money rather than their player-base but I will continue to support Blizzard and WoW despite.,0,Utter boredom. Kill x monsters for no reason. Yay i get exp for a grindfest to 70 where i get equipment for no reason. Oh and i forgot what happened to world pvp?,8,A fun game but not a great game. Its horribly repetitive but for some reason horribly addictive. Whether you love this game or hate it you will end up spending a week's worth of time exploring it. The world is massive the spell effects are somewhat pleasing but the interaction with real players at any moment is what makes this game shine.,2,Probably one of the worst MMO's I have ever played. The whole boring journey to get to 70 is the same thing over and over with overused models and skinned items (usually just a difference in color). The quests are dull even at 70 with going out and killing a certain amount of monsters then coming back. Although some of the last quests are quite fun but there are only 2-3 of them that Probably one of the worst MMO's I have ever played. The whole boring journey to get to 70 is the same thing over and over with overused models and skinned items (usually just a difference in color). The quests are dull even at 70 with going out and killing a certain amount of monsters then coming back. Although some of the last quests are quite fun but there are only 2-3 of them that actually are. The only time I had excitement was when I hit 70 which only lasted about 5 minutes. To level you must grind do horrible quests that will want to make you kill yourself or instances with either 10 year olds (Alliance) or people that need to get jobs and move out of their parent's houses (Horde). Upon getting to 70 you waste your life doing either raiding or PvP. Raiding first of all is fun the first time but then gets repetitive by the 10th time you do it. PvP requires you to wait 10 minutes to get in a battle ground and just end up losing or Arena which is fun but can be very frustrating and annoying. Getting one piece of gear usually takes a whole 1-2 days of sitting in front of a computer. The point of doing these is to get better gear to do better in PvP or raiding. But the only point to PvP or Raid is to get better gear... Didn't make much sense to me. This gear is fun at first but then you realize you wasted your time when you find out the next expansion is coming out and it will be worthless. If that isn't bad enough you must get 10 more levels with the same quests and poorly skinned models as before. People say omg it's the best game ever!11! but that's just because they don't want to admit they wasted their life and lost everything they had before. Don't waste your time or money which you must give up a lot of for this game.,9,Ok after reading every single bad review about this game I figured I might as well post my thoughts on all of them. I see where your complaints are yes but most of them are just simply because you guys don't know how to play the game correctly. WoW is the most impressive polished MMO out there. I have been an MMO addict for a while but never found an MMO that really got my Ok after reading every single bad review about this game I figured I might as well post my thoughts on all of them. I see where your complaints are yes but most of them are just simply because you guys don't know how to play the game correctly. WoW is the most impressive polished MMO out there. I have been an MMO addict for a while but never found an MMO that really got my interest. Graphics wise the game actually has the best graphics of virtually any MMO. Why? The textures are crisp and the best thing is that this MMO runs on every system! My friend that has a 5 year old cheap budget laptop can run this game fine. That's one of the major reasons WoW has sold so much. Many other MMOs that I have tried to play run like sh*t even with my powerful desktops. On my current computer I get a solid 60 FPS all the time. The gameplay is really not that repetitive. It is repetitive if you grind to 60/70. If you wrote a review here and gave it a bad score and said that the game was repetitive then you were grinding. Grinding is not how they intended you to play the game. The game is meant to be played with doing the many quests that they put into the game. Yes the quests make you grind but you get rewarded for them in the end. If you level correctly (solo) then you should be questing 97% of the time the other 3% is in an instance or something. Or you also have the option to level with friends. Blizzard has given us tons of instances to 70. After you quest to about 20 you can instance all the way to 70. Just get a bunch of your friends to play with you. If you play this game right you should be able to hit 70 within a month of making your character. Now people complaining about the cost of WoW... I don't see how you can claim this expensive WoW is the same cost of every other MMO except for free MMOs which don't have the "polish" as a paid one and the rare MMOs like Guild Wars which don't require a monthly subscription. I have played Guild Wars (before I started playing WoW) and had fun leveling to 20 but it didn't have the same fun that WoW has always had for me. Once you finally level to 70 the world opens up for you. You can finally start the end game content and there is A LOT of end game things to do. First thing to do is to find an end game raiding guild. There are tons of them out there recruiting members so just ask politely on trade if you can join one. Once you get into a guild you can start raiding Karazhan which is a massive instance and can be challenging for some guilds and people and will keep you coming back to see if you can clear it faster and more efficiently. Once your guild has become big enough you can start doing the 25 man content which is fun too. Another thing you can start doing at 70 is PvPing. World PvP is lacking yes but you can get a lot of good things from Battlegrounds. The Battlegrounds are all fun and each one is different in what the goal of it is. It ranges from capture the flag to control the bases to capture the flag and control the bases. If big end game PvP isn't your style you can do smaller 2v2 3v3 5v5 matches in the Arena System. The Arena requires you to play much more skillfully and find a good partner and actually really work out tactics. You need a plan and you need to know you class. All these things support to an end game that almost never gets boring. For all of you that say that WoW will make you lose all your friends I don't know what you mean by that. One of my real life friends got me into WoW and I got another real life friend into WoW so I've got a wealth of friends that play with me. All of my friends are addicted to this game so clearly it didn't steal my friends from me! And just because you are addicted to this game doesn't mean you can't play another game. If you are getting a little bored then go play some TF2. Play TF2 for a week or so then go back to WoW. That's what I do if I find myself not able to get into the end game content that week. This game requires skill to play most people think that you can just glide by using auto-attack but that it just not true. In PvP as I said you are fighting a real living human and you really need to work out tactics. Every class can beat every one else it just depends on if you are good at your class. In PvE the bosses require you to coordinate your attacks together and can get really challenging until you master it and get the routine down. So in the end WoW is the best MMO out on the market currently. Yes there are other good MMOs out there worth playing but none have the polish that Blizzard has put into this fine game. I'm not the type of person to say that a game is "perfect" no game really deserves a perfect score because no game is perfect. WoW comes really close to being perfect though I've never experienced a bug that made my want to quit the game right then and there as I have in every other MMO. Anyway this game gets a 9/10 anyone giving this game a 0 has not leveled to 70 and grinded to 35 without doing an instance or finding any friends to quest with.,9,I absolutely love this game. for the people who complain about "bad graphics" or lag problems get better hardware. Your computer needs to be GOOD to run this at an enjoyable rate. Now the reason I give this a 9 even though i love it is because giving it a 10 would basically say "This game is perfect has no flaws graphics are perfect and this game could not be better if it was I absolutely love this game. for the people who complain about "bad graphics" or lag problems get better hardware. Your computer needs to be GOOD to run this at an enjoyable rate. Now the reason I give this a 9 even though i love it is because giving it a 10 would basically say "This game is perfect has no flaws graphics are perfect and this game could not be better if it was motion sensitive.". Because people NOBODY makes perfect games. ABSOLUTELY no game company is flawless. This game does have it's flaws but The gameplay makes up for those MINOR flaws. P.S.: For people who say this game is the worst ever try playing E.T. the Game for the original NES.,2,Ya the game looks good but really you pay about 50.00$ for the game then get all exited and find out you still have to pay 15.00$ a month what crap.,5,I can't explain this game. I'm not having fun  running around aimlessly killing a certain numerical amount of foes to receive a dumb reward but yet I keep doing it. This game is cocaine.,0,This game is the definition of fail. People like it for the addiction they have for it. Say there is an awful game like this one; you play it all day and play no other games. If you were that person you would say it is amazing but honestly if they ever picked up another game they would play 50% less or more.

The quests and raids are repetitive and the PvP is unbalanced the only A+ thing is the environment. I played this game for a year and a half and quit playing 4 months ago and my social life's still hurting.

Do yourself a favor don't play this game.,3,A game such as this is made or broken by its community and in this respect WoW suffers greatly. Mind you its not the players fault since they are "welcomed" in the games habitat. Such players in the old (and good) days of WoW were cast out never really being able to fit in for a multitude of reasons.

Have fun now spending half your "gaming" hours displaying achievements to morons and idiots who want some proof that you are a "good" player... Just steer well clear if you are a serious and thoughtful player.,9,World of Warcraft has quite a few highpoints but it also has a few lows. So i give this game a 9-10 it follows the games storylin quite well aswell as going back to its roots such as Thrall's capture right to the Culling and the Battle for Mount Hyjal,0,As a longtime MMO gamer I approached this game expecting something unique given it's popularity. I will admit that at first it was interesting. I played it for 2 months or so. By that time I had realized however that WoW really doesn't offer anything new. It is basically... just another MMO. The question is why is it so popular? The answer comes in two parts; firstly there As a longtime MMO gamer I approached this game expecting something unique given it's popularity. I will admit that at first it was interesting. I played it for 2 months or so. By that time I had realized however that WoW really doesn't offer anything new. It is basically... just another MMO. The question is why is it so popular? The answer comes in two parts; firstly there is advertising. Lots and lots of it. We've all seen the adds and so it's pretty well known. This part is encouraged (via word of mouth) by the second part - Addiction - Blizzard are experts at making addictive games. Look at Diablo 2 and Starcraft. They are both old outdated games and yet both still have huge amounts of players. You could say this is because they are good games and that is true to an extent. But it's mostly in the way they are designed. They give you a false sense of achievement that keeps you coming back for more. WoW is FULL of this. To an extent every mmorpg is but WoW especially. Ultimately the PVP is poor the world and characters look like a cartoon and frankly the quests are downright boring and disjointed most of the time. This game is crap crap laced with the most addictive drug in the world. If i was being honest I would give this game a 5. However I'm going to give it a 0 just so my vote counts more - this game doesn't deserve to be on or anywhere near the top games list.,0,I played this game for three years and started when burning crusade came out and about 3 months after wrath of the lich king came out.

If you don't play enough you will run about with horrible gear and people will 2 shot and laugh at you in pvp. I did everything there was to do in the game for burning crusade. It takes Too much time to get anywhere in the game. Don't be another victim of blizzard!,3,Great game. However I have been playing this game for a few years and when Blizzard adds more levels and more quests and more things to do and places to go and on and on it is getting to be too much and for me the game was getting to be too much new stuff but not enough fixing up the bugs or touching up the old quests or areas or tweaking up what was already in the game. Why add Great game.

Why add more stuff when they could have fixed up some old things? So many things they could have done to just make the game better with 'touchups' instead of adding more stuff! Got to be too much and not worth it!,2,WoW is a game lacking in innovation.  The only real reason it has survived is because it originates from a great RTS series whose story line it killed.  It's graphics are also a tragedy of modern gaming.  The only value of the game is if you are playing on a private server at least then you don't have to pay the subscription fees.

I feel the game is being released too early hence i have no doubt huge patches are going to be released real soon. I feel the lighting could use a lot more dynamics and the game should offer higher graphical settings for higher end systems because currently even with everything set towards best graphics i gotta say blizzard is really underperformingHmmm.. rather quite disappointed.

I'm not going to tailor it to every forum etc I post in so here you go.Everyone here and beyond has thier opinions  I know but I believe GW is the best MMORPG on the market.  I have had a little experience with Ever Quest and a WHOLE lot of experience with World of Warcraft.  Guild Wars should continue to be better with updates fixesThis is Something I have posted elsewhere.  I'm not going to tailor it to every forum etc I post in so here you go.Everyone here and beyond has thier opinions  I know but I believe GW is the best MMORPG on the market.  I have had a little experience with Ever Quest and a WHOLE lot of experience with World of Warcraft.  Guild Wars should continue to be better with updates fixes balances and expansions just like every other persitent online game.  Guild Wars sets itself apart in a few good respects:-The updating is painless.  No need to download huge patches.  It patches small parts of the game as you load different areas.  Very nice.  Nothing worse than jumping on to play a little of your game to realize that you have to spend the next 30 - 60 mins downloading and patching before you can jump on and play like in WOW.-The gameplay is fun and tailored more toward skill.  You do have to spend some time leveling up your character if you want the best of the best but it is the same in ANY MMO out there it's the whole point of giving you something to keep doing and goals to achieve. One of my favorite things is the rewards for completing quests.  You actually get skills for completing quests.  This to me helps get rid of the desire to "grind" for levels.  As in WOW it is actually quicker to just "farm" or "grind" in a specific area for experience to level than to do the quests.  All you get from the quests in WOW is weapons  armor or items that are most likely (%90 of the time) worse than what you already have.  Also with GW it is nice not knowing when or where you will actually be getting your next skill from.  I know that sounds wierd but in WOW you get "new" skills ("new" is usualy just upgrades for the skills you already have  you will have %60 of all the skills you will ever learn by lvl 20 %80 by lvl 30 and %95 by lvl 40) every "even" level.  And it could take a good 3 hrs to get to the next level if all you do is grind.  So you play for about 6 hrs killing the same thing over and over again to get small upgrades.  And you keep doing it cause you know you have to to get that new item armor skill etc.  With GW since you don't have that whole level crunching to get what you want thing you are enticed to explore the world.  -And the world is nicely detailed.  It could use a little more fleshing out but over all it is nice.  It really is no different than any other MMORPG.  The land is vast with small pockets of towns and is sparsely populated with NPCs.  The same with WOW.  But what is nice with GW is that once you get to a main town/outpost you can teleport thier instantly.  In WOW  you might spend 20 mins just flying/running to get to where you need to be and that is only once you hit lvl 40 and buy a mount (wich is no small feat or small amount of cash).  With WOW before you are lvl 40 you could easily spend 30 - 60 mins.  Depending on whether or not you have gotten the right "Flight Paths" to get to where you need to be.  -The Quest sytem is nice in GW.  It's easy to understand and you get a friggin green arrow that tells you where you should be going next what instance to go into and where on the map you need to be.  In WOW good luck  you will probably be looking it up in an Online Database or asking around.  Wich is not such a big deal but you will be amazed at how much more time is spent actually playing instead of runing around looking for stuff and how more efficient you can plan your questing adventures.  A few mins spent in GW you can see how many quests are in a certain area and plan to do those so that you can kill more birds with one stone.  Thank you for that Anet.-Once you get to the lvl Cap and have gotten all your skills (there are "elite" skills which you can only get by learning them from enemies) you can do the PvP portions of the game wich are fast paced and action packed.  I've read a lot of things about how hard it is to compete in PvP because you can't find a good group of people to play with.  Well it's the same in ANY online game RPG or FPS or RTS.  It takes some time to find good people to play with but once you do it can be a lot of fun.  At least in GW you have the options to join a PvP game by yourself or with a group you're with or do guild vs guild.  And the system matches you up with like experienced/leveled/Rank people.  You can kind of do the same thing in WOW with the battle grounds addition (wich was just added about mid year 2005) but the long que waits (about 20 - 45mins depending on server population) might be kind of tedious for you.  Especially if your lvl 60 with not a whole lot to do otherwise.  And with GW if you don't want to do the questing part of the game you don't have to.  You can imediatley create a PvP only character.  Your PvP only character will not have all the perks of a character that got to lvl 20 by questing but you can still have a lot of fun you just won't be the best of the best.  At least you have the option.-As far as GW not being considered a MMO:  GW in my opinion is more MMO than any other MMORPG.  With WOW you pick a specific server to build your characters on.  You can have many characters on several different servers but if they are on different servers you can't play with people on other servers.  Wich might not be a big deal but if you find you like the people better on a certain server or want to play on the RPG servers or PvP servers you have to be lucky enough for them to offer transfers from your server to those servers.  Wich they don't seem to do until a specific server is being over populated.  Where as with GW you are automatically logged on to a specific "district"  and at your whim you can change districts.  Even internationally.  This way ANYONE that plays GW can hook up with ANYONE else that is on at the time.  That to me is closer to "Massively Multiplayer" than the server specific variety of MMO's.-In relation to the whole MMO thing.  Everything outside the main towns/outposts is instanced for every specific group.  I love this.  As in all MMORPG's there is a lot of quests that require you to spend time traveling in the unknown wilderness to get something kill something etc.  Few things are more bothersome than going to do such a quest and finding several like powered individuals doing the exact same thing.  I thought I was supposed to be unique  I thought my quest was uniqe.  WOW fails misrabley here.  You will always be on the same quest as someone else if not many people.  You might even have to wait around while the enemy critter(s) respawn or even fight with someone else over who gets to kill what or just get ganked.  This is not an epic experience to me.  So what if I'm a powerfull "Hero" there are going to be thousands of the exact same type of hero out there with you.  The "World" of Warcraft is populated more by "heroes" than normal peole.  In GW it may be the case as well but at least you don't have to see them all the time.-There is not a lot of emphisis on item collection for other than profit/sales.  This I know a lot of people dislike but in my opinion it adds to the gameplay.  Instead an endless struggle to get a new axe with a +2 to strength instead of a +1 it doesn't really matter in GW.  You will be just as effective and they are there for the item needy person but the game doesn't revolve around it.  It's all WOW is about really getting a better version of what you had before.-The skill system is really nice in GW.  You only get to take 8 skills into battle.  Wich can be frustrating at times where you wish you would have taken another skill instead but over all it forces you to be specific on what type of character you are playing.  Wich is also nice because there are more than one use/roll for your character now.  The duel class system is cool  you get to choose from two sets of skills but only the first class you choose lets you alter thier main attribute wich does make a difference in you character.  And the abillity to change you attributes at will is very nice.  Now you can only change skills/spells and attributes in main towns/outposts but the frustation is minimal for the freedom to tailor your character so many ways.-The rank system for new items is nice to me.  It gives the long term player something to shoot for.  And it is no better or worse than WOW in my opinion  both are a pain for the casual gamer and a pain for the consitent gamer.  It rewards time spent gaming.  Same with WOW.-I really like the story of GW.  It could be a little deeper but it's nice.  I also like you the land changes with the story.  Right now there is only the two settings or time periods but at least I felt that I went a long with a change in time for the game.  I also like how the main characters of the story are also interactive with most of the main quests.  When you are called to help the prince with pushing back the enemy he is there with you fighting along side.  Also seen in many of the "side" quests with the everyday folk.  Or when you complete a quest that called you to kill a Leader or find a group and lead them back if you go back to the same spots later the people or leader are gone.  Giving you a sense of actual accomplishment.  Good luck in WOW to see any of this in WOW.  Very few NPC characters actually physically come along with you and if they do then that means someone else can't interact with them and vise versa for you.  Not one time in my whole WOW career did I ever see any piece of land change or NPC character good or bad change wether or not I completed a specific quest 10 times.  How epic is that.  The biggest reason for this is because there isn't a whole lot to do than the same thing over and over again in WOW that's why so many people have logged in so many hours in WOW.  They took half a game spread it out over twice as many levels as they should have and charged people for it.  Wich leads into my biggest rant.-GW is free to play online.  They update it regularly with new content as well as fixes.  WOW charges you $13 - $15 per month to play (depending on whether you pay monthy or in 6 month blocks both reacuring automatically) wether you play at all or all day everyday.  And that's not the worst part.  WOW was released before it was complete.  So you payed $50 for half a game  I already said that I know but one of the biggest reasons Blizzard said the cost was so high per month was because they would be updating it constantly for free.  Well guess what a year later they are finally to the point the game should have been when it was released.  This is not an opinion.  You can't honestly tell me that such big things like the PvP ranking/honor sytem was something they just came up with or the battle grounds addition.  These where things they had planned that just didn't get in to the release.  And there is more updates comming.  Now for some numbers.  5 million people have active accounts on WOW  most are paying accounts some are trial accounts.  Lets go back a bit and cut the number in have just to be conservative.  Lets say 2 million people have been playing and only half of those were paying customers and lets say they all payed in 6 month blocks at $13 a month.   1 million times $13 a month = 13 million dollars a MONTH with equals 156 million dollars a year.    If that isn't absurd to you then you have a bigger problem than what video game to play.  There is no way that it cost that much to keep WOW servers running or fix bugs.  And that number is not including the original profit from the sales of the game (remember each paying active account also bought the game) or the profit from the merchandise they sell and there is a whole lot of merchandise to buy and or being bought.  So with all that cash they are just finishing a game and guess what they are going to charge you another $20 - $50 to buy the expansion 1st quarter 2006.  This is the main reason I quit WOW  I can not support such a greedy company for a product that is lower in quality than one that is of higher quality from a company that does just as much if not more for thier game.-On some less positive notes for GW:  Jumping would be nice.  I know it doesn't really do anything for you and would mess up the PvP arenas (they could disable it there) it is just nice to jump small con in my opinion.  A little more content on the RPG side of the game would be nice.  More scripted quests with NPC's would be nice.  Over all just small cons that could be or will be changed/fixed with updates and expansions. All in all this is a very good game and has shown it is impoving.  It is the best MMORPG out there in my opinion but that doesn't mean it will satisfy everyone out there.  And another game is sure to come alone to take your time elsewhere.  At least with GW when the time comes for that other game you will still have some cash in your pocket :),9,I totally rulez at this game! My avatar is da bomb and I pwn you.

That said if you're thinking about getting in on the action remember this. While World of Warcraft has dominated the MMORPG market it is still an MMORPG. Blizzard is no doubt one of the great kings of video game making right up there with the likes of Valve and Bioware. Its for With millions of subscribes there is no doubt that World of Warcraft is an amazing commercial success. That said if you're thinking about getting in on the action remember this. While World of Warcraft has dominated the MMORPG market it is still an MMORPG. Blizzard is no doubt one of the great kings of video game making right up there with the likes of Valve and Bioware. Its for good reason - Blizzard makes games that are both entertaining and accessible. Their games run on surpisingly old systems and usually are ported to the mac as well. They're all about making sure anyone can play. They are also all about making improvements rather than innovations. Starcraft did nothing new - it simply did it better - and the same can be said for all their titles except perhaps Diablo. World of Warcraft has done nothing to break that trend. In some ways this has worked brilliantly. World of Warcraft only had 9 classes which isn't many compared to the likes of Everquest 2 which boasts something over twenty. But Blizzard also knows the more classes you add the less defined each one gets - and so the classes in World of Warcraft are very well defined in their roles and also in the artistic style of their magic and gear. When you play a Paladin you really feel like a bringer of justice and as a high-level Paladin you'll have the nifty do-gooder horse and the shiny clean plate-mail to prove it. World of Warcraft tries to make sure players occupied and is loaded with quests to complete. PvP is easy to access yet also easy to stay away from. Yet World of Warcraft does stumble in some areas. Blizzard has never been good at interfaces and this isn't any different in World of Warcraft. Why doesn't the map lable almost anything or have a built in coordinate system? Why does the default set-up only show damage done to me in the very upper left corner of the screen? Why arn't the timers that show me when a spell or ability is useable again clearer? Why why why indeed. The group interface is similarly annoying. It's clunky the colors arn't bright enough and its very easy to have someone die on you before you even notice they're under attack unless you constantly stare at the group section of the screen. In addition there is no good way to create groups. Finding a meeting stone doesn't give you a pop-up menu showing everyone currently looking for a group for that instance - instead it simply throws you into a group with whoever else is currently wanting to go. Which is of course a horrible way to create a well balanced group. The looking-for-group channel is no better since is global and is getting spammed constantly. Luckily many of these interface short-comings can be fixed with a few user modifications. But the biggest problem with World of Warcraft is it's most subjective - its still a MMORPG and its really just Everquest with the biggest frustrations taken out of it. Note I said biggest. Leveling to sixty only takes a few months for casual player. But thats still a pretty long time to play one video game. There are many travel routes but there are still times when you have to spend twenty minutes walking somewhere doing nothing. Quests are there but most are still uninteresting. And there is still a sense of grinding - that is to say suffering through bordom of killing the same monsters over and over in order to achieve a goal. To some that goal is very well worth it. But to me it isn't. If you like MMORPGs there really isn't anything that can compete. But if you're like me and wish the genre would tone down the grinding and add in more challenging and academic quests World of Warcraft isn't going to offer anything new. If you've played Everquest Asheron's Call Anarchy Online or any similar game just detract a few problems you don't like and you've got World of Warcraft.,9,Would have been a perfect 10 if not for too many down times. For $50.00 + $15.00 a month there should be little to none. I have free Massively played online games which I purchased for much less and experience very little if any down times.,0,Totally overrated. Blizzard is one of my favourite companies however this monstrosity of an MMO will leave you disappointed dispite all the hype.

And the expansion they follow the same format AWE and then disgust/boredom up until level 70. Anyone who says this game deserves a 10 has absolutely no idea what they are talking about or has chosen this game to be their first MMORPG.,1,Give me the hate mail i played this game a few times but i did play eq2 first thats probably what murdered it. The game is great till you hit level 10 where your practically running in circles killing things till level 60....it takes forever to get places because you have to wait till 40 for a mount and the visuals are cartoony and childish.

Not enough detail in character creation to little races and class's sooo many people look the same. This game is a waste of money and time...if you've hit level cap i'm sure you dont have much of an outside life. It looks as if all the people who rated 8-10 probably played runescape or WoW as their first mmorpg.,4,Overrated. The graphics are not very good it fells a bit unserious and way to cartoonish. The sounds and music is decent but there is nothing really special or cool about it medicore. But the worst about this game is the gameplay. The quests are extremely repeative and dull it fells like they just putted them into some random generator and then something popped out. Most of them are Overrated.

A very medicore game nothing really stunishing about it just flat medicore. Fine for new people for a little while but not good enough in the length.,3,"This isnt a game Its a drug" i half agree with this statment this is either a drug or a social medium. the excuses you tell yourself are either. "just one more run and I can get that epic purple" or "what would my online friends do without me to tank" but eventually you realize you are just wasting time and money for a 15$ a month excuse.,9,This is THE MMORPG. It's got everything you could want including a player base now numbering about 7 million. So the haters are welcome to play something else you won't be missed.,0,Blizzard should stick to what it knows best RTSs and Pointless Hack and Slash games. This has to be one of the biggest jokes of an MMORPG on the market. There is no learning curve at all to keep hords of idiotic players from joining and using up server bandwidth.

Only source of community is blinding number of raids to get items to compete for the title of PENULTIMATE DORK. Graphics are interesting but the color scheme is far too bright. Its a terrible title.,4,This game gets about a 9 right up until you hit max level.

I played is for about 3 weeks it was a waste of money and time. I mean $20 a month just to play a game?

It's not a perfect game -- but its a must try. P.S.--people who complain about $15 a month - - BIG retards. If you check out payment options you can get it for $72 dollas a year a cool $6 bucks a month just $1 more than a runescape member account.,9,Most people just don't get how to rate you're rating the game not how many minutes or hours people spend on it or how many lifeless losers play.

Also the graphics are pathetic the story is out of the window and it costs you money and time. A better way to waste your money and life would be to withdraw all of your money and then jump off a highway bridge. This game is utterly pathetic.,3,Little to almost no support from the Game masters "im sorry we cant do that" is most often their response and the constant under cutting of players who are good at the game.

The graphics are very old and are the worst in this category of game. The whole MMORPG idea is just addictive yet boring but if you feel you must play them then at least play a half decent one! Guild Wars is much better than WoW as it requires skill and you don't have to bore yourself grinding to level 70 to get into any of the good stuff. The graphics rape WoW's as well.,0,Believe the red posts here: WoW is a drug not a game. Like all drugs some people get some enjoyment out of it some don't. Some get addicted easily some don't.

MMORPGS aren't at all that great in my opinion and WoW is quite an overated game situated in this category. If the harsh graphics ear piercing sound and mindless gameplay don't turn you off of this game the community should. My advise don't waste your time.,1,I can only feel pity for anyone who has actually played world of warcraft. Game is designed to be an endless grind of your time and not actually have substance or interest. Add that blizzard is a sellout since activision and you have a game designed to sink in way more money than you intend.,5,World Of Warcraft does it's PvE like no other and in that area it's a great game. However it's PvP is some of the worst I've seen. The game-play makes sense but it's very casual an every body wins kinda thing.

It's also based on items and not so much a skill game.,5,Decent entry level MMORPG.  Very easy to control and get into.

The more casual players seemed too desperate to fit in while some of the more extreme players seemed elitist.  After a while quests start to meld together pvp became tedious and biased towards the player that can play 9 hours a day to get the best equipment and towards the end I found my self just wandering around the map looking for stuff that gave the game meaning.  Plus when I left the player felt disconnected from the world.  No matter what happened Horde land was Horde land Alliance land was Alliance land.  Then when you get to the end highest level with good gear then what?  When playing I asked my guild the three most popular responses were either raiding PvP or start a new character.  So after a years work I was supposed to do what I've been doing only this time with no end.  Some of the few upsides to the game are the back stories to the races and the benefits and downsides to the races go hand and hand nicely.  Ping time was alright and lag wasn't noticeable even after moving to Europe and keeping my character on a US server.  Graphics seem cartoonish but it adds to the games atmosphere.  Auction houses are a nice way to form a player economy.  Fairly easy to find and form parties for quests/raids.  I give this game a 5 mainly because if you do find a group of friends to quest with it can be tolerable but if you quest alone it gets repetitive and if you join a random group there is a good chance it won't stick together until the end of the quest.,9,Very addictive. The quest system is great - always lots to do. However the lag issues are EXTREMELY bad. I would say that about half the time I have spent on this game has been wasted due to lag - dying to monsters that don't lag etcetc....but still a lot of potential for this game.

I regret spending money on it at launch wish I'd waited 3 months.,6,Initially very fun but the need for nonstop grinding and a willingness to sacrifice real life enjoyment to make in-game progress after level 60 ruins it.,1,Posting reviews for this game are pointless - you're going to buy this based on what you're friends say not what I say. But I'm reviewing this briefly none the less. WoW is the biggest MMO out there today but in my opinion it is a very poor game.

I played up to level 54 and 56 on a rogue and paladin respectively tried out a Warlock to 43 - so I'm more than well versed in the gameplay. But the fact remains this game is entirely grinding until you hit the max level. There is no real storyline and almost no real interaction between players unless you play with friends or actually roleplay on one of the roleplaying servers (although nobody roleplays there really). If you want to spend countless hours killing 10 Thistlebark Geomancers 10 Thistlebark Hunters and 10 Thistlebark Waterweavers and countless hours collecting 60 Boar Tusks turning it in for a quarter of your XP bar and then doing it all again over and over go ahead. If you want to go spend countless hours doing the same Capture-the-Flag or King of the Hill PvP battlegrounds just to fight against players that have better gear but are less skilled than you (But kill you anyway) be my guest. This game is a waste of money and a waste of life. Go out and find a boyfriend or girlfriend instead.,0,Why Blizzard WHY!?! I've played WoW and i can't stand the game. I don't understand how so many people like it. THIS IS THE WORST MMO I HAVE EVER PLAYED. I've played some bad ones. Also another reason I dislike the game so much it doesn't even deserve hell Blizzard killed one of their best franchises. I loved WarCraft AS AN RTS. It's just not good as an MMO.,9,I give this a 9 because of the fun that I have playing it. In my opinion the people who gave it such low scores have either barely played the game or are not very good at playing it.,10,Best game ever with amazing graphics.You get addicted to it since its so good.I recommend this game to anyone.,10,Over the years this game has beat all the rest everquest guild wars hell gate you name it and WoW beats it. Its going a little downhill latly by making the game a little to easy but thats what the majority of new players want now days and they are paying blizzard the most so thats what we will get. Yes everyone there is the 15$ a month fee and you all can say if it wasent there then Over the years this game has beat all the rest everquest guild wars hell gate you name it and WoW beats it.

This game is really good is every aspect every graphics are going up now. For everyone saying that it will ruin your life... WoW didn't ruin your life you just need to work on self control and find other things to do. I personally have a few 80s well geared a job a girlfriend a car(+ payment/insurance) i have all A's in AP classes and im even playing tennis while have a great social life don't say this game ruins your life. You not having self control and balance ruins your life. I can honestly say that there either won't ever be a better MMORPG or there isn't going to be one that will be WoW for a very very very very long time with the main reason being its online community of course. In my person opinion the game has a few things that i get annoyed by but im not paying blizzard 10 million a month+ so i don't decide what they have to do. My final opinion is that this game is great for anyone who only has around an hour or so every few days or weekends to play or someone that can play for 12+ hours a day either solo or with a group it won't cost you a great computer and i still feel you'll enjoy more aspects of the game then you will dislike them. 10,10,This game is very near and dear to me.

Though it has now been a while since the game launched there's still a slight allure to World of Warcraft.  Should Blizzard ever follow up on it with a new iteration of it say a World of StarCraft entry there's sure to be a repeat of history.,9,When the original WoW came out it revolutionized the genre and brought it to mainstream gaming.

This game is so addictive and fun. If your a mmorpg fan then play it! If your a newbie at mmorpg's i'd suggest taking this out for a spin first. It has a few bugs but it doesn't get in the way of how fun it is!,7,I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since it was released. Initially I found it incredibly boring after getting to level 20. It's slowly grown on me through the years and I suspect it has to do with my patience and the Blizzard developers getting better at making MMOs more accessible. Normally I'm against "accessibilty" for a larger audience but this is one of the few timesI've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since it was released.

Another aspect that has made the game better by far is friends. When I first started I didn't talk to anyone or try to join any guilds but when I started again a year ago I did with my girlfriend who has friend that play WoW. I have to say playing with other people increases the entertainment value by a lot. All in all I can say that World of Warcraft is a very solid game and while not my favorite I will eventually pick it up again when I have the time and I will enjoy it.,7,World of Warcraft is indeed an awesome title but there are some things that make this game not worth the time.

Let me start with the pros: This is a great continuation of the Warcraft universe the areas are awesome and there are a few recognizable characters. The game is very easy to learn with some really simple controls. The graphics are nice adds a little of the cartoony feel you got in the original strategy games. Now the cons: Game play is a little repetitive until you start hitting the higher levels (50+) which would take about a month or so to get to. The community is really rude sometimes only caring about themselves and shunning upon the lower levels. Sometimes it feels like there is no mature people online ever. Usually the two factions are highly unbalanced and theres always different kinds of people that play on them on each server. All in all this is a good game that has some minor set backs. But if you are looking for a mature game then this isn't for you.,8,World of Warcraft gives most of what can be asked for in a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG).

It is also one of the very few MMORPG's I've played that is able to preserve the feeling of being a vast world without going too far. Leveling in the game is also quite quick and quite fun which is also appreciable. The game does sport a few problems. The quest system in the game does not have much of a plot line unlike other games. Quite a few of the quests are repetitive kill x number of y's. While the quests are quite easy and completable this repetitiveness is quite a drawback. At the moment there is also an annoying glitch still to be resolved at the moment which causes the game to crash when entering highly populated areas. While Blizzard has promised to fix this glitch quite soon it is still a shame to pay such a high subscription fee to still have to deal with this problem. In my opinion the game is worth the subscription rate if you have the time to play it and are willing to pay.,5,I personally hate online games like this but I suppose this is better than the rest - though with the monthly price I could probably buy a lot of things more worth while.

It's clear that a lot of work went into creating this and making it very accessible but after a while it becomes repetitious and you'd think they would cheapen up the monthly price now that they're pretty much billionaires. Then again it really depends on who plays it. I tried it out for about a year and got a lot of pretty awesome things that you can do but traveling is very tedious to get those things and you have to have a lot of time on your hands (or you'd have to be extremely bored or have no life - as South Park suggests) to even consider doing half of what is available to do in the game. And they keep adding on which is great for frequent users but for everyone else it's only so-so. I guess it really depends on what kind of person you are and what you enjoy - for me it's just okay. Sadly 'okay' isn't worth $15 a month.,8,It's difficult to review a behemoth of a game like World of Warcraft.

The developers have gone out of their way over the years to provide a ridiculous amount of polished content to every type of player. PvP is fast-paced exciting and competitive. Raiding can be casual or hardcore depending on how you approach it. The random casual players can hop into a quick dungeon or battleground level tradeskills participate in the holiday-based world events or just level another character. Combat can be simple or complex depending on how deeply you choose to delve into the math behind the numbers. The graphics are dated but have aged well thanks to its cartoon-like aesthetic. The music is top-notch. UI modification is excellent. I don't have many bad things to say about World of Warcraft but I gave it an 8 because I preferred the game when it was more difficult and catered to a more hardcore audience.,10,This is by far the greatest game of all time yes it is addicting and yes there are elitist jerks on it but as far as MMORPG's go this game is the King to never be dethroned. The only people saying it sucks are baddies who could not defeat any raid bosses.,5,Not bad game but it gets boring quickly. Level upping is slow and boring when you are low level there's almost nothing funny to do. I also hate how much money does Blizzard want for being able to play on official server. Wasn't the damned game expensive enough.,7,Every gamer should try World of Warcraft because it is a major milestone in gaming history.  It is a high quality game and provides endless entertainment thus the high rating.  The game can require logic and a strategic mind skill and creativity but it will most likely teach you to kill monsters rapidly for virtual gold and experience.

It is a high quality game and provides endless entertainment thus the high rating.  The game can require logic and a strategic mind skill and creativity but it will most likely teach you to kill monsters rapidly for virtual gold and experience.  In my opinion most gamers and people will find a game like this to rapidly occupy more and more of their life and this can be expected because of its similar dopamine releasing effect of many drugs.,5,The game has normal missions (like an other MMORPG)sound track its enjoyablethe controls are normal (like an other normal MMORPG)...Battle mode sucks compared to other games like Metin 2 (MMORPG) etc...The Game is just over rated by nerds and people that have no life i played the to LVL 7 or 8 and its just a normal online game if you want a real good gameplay on a MMORPG play metin 2.,6,Once a good game it has been ruined by FotM gamebreaking bugs for the classes Blizz doesn't like (ie- pets for hunters spawning with 500 hp and promptly being one shot by an aoe a bug that's been in almost two years without a fix) as well as a complete change from challenging raids and fun pvp to gear grinding.

If you enjoy korean grindfests this game is right for you. Don't be fooled by the 10 million subs 80% of those don't pay monthly for the game. The game was good once now it's not. But at least we have pokemon and pandas to look forward to.,6,Very nice game but Blizzard could do better. The game lacks the atmosphere found in Diablo and other games from this company. Also the graphics don't seem as good as they used to when the game launched. The mechanics are also much too repetitive for my taste.,7,i think people are missing the point with the cartoony graphics making the game playable to people with low spec laptops just means more players something that all other mmos suffer from a lack of players. im getting bored of the game now after playing for a few years but the fact its kept me active for a few years says a lot no other games done that before. i think its a shame how tsi think people are missing the point with the cartoony graphics making the game playable to people with low spec laptops just means more players something that all other mmos suffer from a lack of players. im getting bored of the game now after playing for a few years but the fact its kept me active for a few years says a lot no other games done that before. i think its a shame how ts so dummied down now though 1-100 in 2 weeks  is a poor show in this kind of game (with heirlooms of course). it is a shame how its all been simplified now due to blizz trying to get more custom aimed at the people who need instant gratification with no effort but i guess thats business for a 10 year old game it has to die someday i guess :),6,The game was great a few years ago. I remember when I knew what all the items in the game looked like when it mattered to have rare gear when the people playing could be relied on to have a bit of skill and some manners. Expansion packs have inflated everything in the game so much and dumbed it down so much that everything has lost meaning. Everything is an endless grind even grindingThe game was great a few years ago.

If you've never played it give it a go but it's just not the same astonishing experience any more.,7,good timesthis game was the greatest way to kill timei used to no life it for hours XD but sadly the game died with cataclysm for meall those new add ons just messed it up.The pvp was a beast but i couldnÂ´t really give a damn bout the questsif you have never played wow before definatley try it out although personally i dont play it enymore as i prefer swtor with itsgood timesthis game was the greatest way to kill timei used to no life it for hours XD but sadly the game died with cataclysm for meall those new add ons just messed it up.The pvp was a beast but i couldnÂ´t really give a damn bout the questsif you have never played wow before definatley try it out although personally i dont play it enymore as i prefer swtor with its updated graphics and a good storyline.,9,this game is so great i mean hours on hours of game play meeting many people online doing a lot of questdown low rating why it never got 10 is because this is not free to play and 60gb worth of download update i rather use my gb on something more important,9,The Burning Crusade was good Wrath of the Lich King was OK Cataclysm ditto. But the original game was an absolute revelation when it came out and when taken as a whole and considering what existed before WoW came along (and even to this day it has very few serious competitors almost a decade later) then you can only conclude that the World of Warcraft experience is about as perfect as it gets.,6,Vanilla was great. Simple without all this **** around. You want to play a dungeon you have to go to the stone and get in the waiting list. It was all fun because you had to communicate really. Now itÂ´s a real bull****. The whole Land is empty you can run and run and you will see nobody. Everyone is in Ironforge or else and go to the Dungeon Kill the Boss Farm and getVanilla was great.

Everyone is in Ironforge or else and go to the Dungeon Kill the Boss Farm and get back to the Sell the Items. And they do that the whole **** day. Or better they buy directly the Armor Set for 20 bucks in real. This all was pathetic and ridicoulous. So i give a 6 because of the beginning.,7,I have played wow for 7 years. And up until cata it was wow or nothing. But in recent content wow has burned and crashed. It had a chance to pull it back in Cata but chose to ignore feedback and stick to its massive subscribers. Blizzard is rich and gets feed even though its players are leaving so they took advantage over the fact and left wow to die. Rumor is Blizzard is making a newI have played wow for 7 years.

Rumor is Blizzard is making a new mmo possible a mmofps as of 2012 the genre started and became a gamers lust. all in all Wow let me down after years and years of passive grind.,9,Quite a lot mixed feelings over here. The game is awesome. It brought MMO to a higher level in my opinion. Have played it not much long before the 'Burning Crusade' expansion. I got in the World of Azeroth thanks to a couple of my friends. They tought me the basics. Graphics are awesome and your PC doesn't need the specifications of a space shuttle to run it on 'Ultra' settings. TheQuite a lot mixed feelings over here. The game is awesome.

They tought me the basics. Graphics are awesome and your PC doesn't need the specifications of a space shuttle to run it on 'Ultra' settings. The music is one thing that will always stick with me and every time I will hear the soundtrack it will take me back to those good times. If you played this game a bit longer than your average game you'll notice that this is one hell of a masterpiece. Creating a game this complex and therefor needs a huge team with a lot of experts. Not that surprising they have of course. Yet on the other hand the expansions are sweet but don't they bring the game only to a lower level? Honestly most people (of which I am one) find this set back since the beginning because once a Raid where die hard players with skill. Now they have brought all these features that help the beginning player (which is nice for them) yet easily letting them gain entry with these die hard players. which makes it all the more quite a waste of time. But let's not forget this game is fantastic. Stopped playing it for a while but from time to time... I really wonder getting started and getting addicted again.,9,Somewhere around patch 1.7 during the vanilla wow period this game was near perfect. A lot of you don't even remember those times. It's just sad how bad things have gone since then.,8,The overall best MMO I\'ve ever played I don\'t play anymore because I thought Cataclysm was pretty lame and MoP does not interest me but the game is 8 years old and is packed with content.  You could do a lot worse.,9,Start playing vanilla almost year before bc I was pretty much one noob so I could not play at high levels however I still remember the amazement every time I discovered a new area and how much I loved those times.,9,I began playing World of Warcraft in mid-2006 and in its original form it was a work of brilliance. Never before in my life have I been gripped with addiction so completely by a game's lore gameplay social life crafting and leveling system.

Never before in my life have I been gripped with addiction so completely by a game's lore gameplay social life crafting and leveling system. I'd played all three games in the original Warcraft series and was well aware how captivating Blizzard games were but WoW was their crowning jewel in my mind. It had everything - socializing cooperation solitary playing lore and a difficulty level that made me feel that I'd actually accomplished something when I finally got it right because you had to WORK for what you got - gold levels raid progression rare drops gear - so when you actually accomplished it it really felt amazing. "Vanilla WoW" as it's now called will always remain one of the top games in my mind and my time spend during the original incarnation of this game will always be remembered fondly.,10,This is the game that took control of my life starting in early 2005 and I've been playing ever since.  This game probably ruined marriages and friendships just like Everquest did.  Babies were malnourished and jobs were lost.  There was no outside world for a lot of people that were addicted to this game including myself.  But regardless there will most likely never again be an MMOThis is the game that took control of my life starting in early 2005 and I've been playing ever since.  This game probably ruined marriages and friendships just like Everquest did.  Babies were malnourished and jobs were lost.  There was no outside world for a lot of people that were addicted to this game including myself.  But regardless there will most likely never again be an MMO as successful as World of Warcraft.  Final Fantasy XI didn't come close and I was also addicted to City of Heroes me and my friends were switching to WoW.  World of Warcraft will go down in history as the most successful MMO ever created.,7,I love WoW and I find it kind of sad that pretty much everyone hates it. Sure the payments are high and the leveling is painful but that doesn't take much out of the actual game for anyone who's actually tried it. But I really think they're making too much expansions. And they gradually went down hill on MoP. Cata and WotLK were the best imo.,6,World of Warcraft fue un buen juego para mi en lo personal juegue 6 años y fue bastante divertido luego de Cata deje de pagar la suscripción porque ya no me gustaba lo que veía le doy un 6 porque todos estos años de diversión fueron buenos pero ahora blizzard solo saca dinero por tonterías.Graficos: 5   Sonido: 9   Jugabilidad: 7  Contenido:World of Warcraft fue un buen juego para mi en lo personal juegue 6 años y fue bastante divertido luego de Cata deje de pagar la suscripción porque ya no me gustaba lo que veía le doy un 6 porque todos estos años de diversión fueron buenos pero ahora blizzard solo saca dinero por tonterías.Graficos: 5   Sonido: 9   Jugabilidad: 7  Contenido: 6   y solo por el hecho de tener que pagar por las expanciones  mas el costo mensual le doy un 6 en total si solo fuera costo mensual talvez le doy un 8.5.pero ya wow esta llegando a su fin Espero que proyecto titan tenga algo nuevo que ofrecernos.,9,Surely one of the best games of all time especially its first vanilla version before they got acquired by Activision and dumbed everything down. At least you can still play it in its original 1.12 state on some private servers..,9,The original World Of Warcraft was everything players who loved the universe wanted it to be sticking to the lore and feeling of the massively popular Warcraft III. A true test of skill and patience for all those who played. Sadly each expansion has "Casualized" this now to its current product. This rating is based on the original vanilla version.,7,WoW is a good game. Some of the quests are very boring however nothing like the epic quests seen in Runescape. WoW also lacks the character development i expect in a MMORPG unlike Runescape which has great character development. Overall forget WoW just play Runescape!,7,There are a lot of people who consider the original WoW the "Vanilla" as they call it the pinnacle of MMOs. Too much nostalgia i guess. For lots of players it was their first MMO. Not for me. i had already been a veteran of Everquest 1 and 2. So after failing to adjust in Everquest 2 because of its complete lack of solo content then i tried WoW. I found a decent game which had lots ofThere are a lot of people who consider the original WoW the "Vanilla" as they call it the pinnacle of MMOs. Too much nostalgia i guess. For lots of players it was their first MMO. Not for me. i had already been a veteran of Everquest 1 and 2. So after failing to adjust in Everquest 2 because of its complete lack of solo content then i tried WoW. I found a decent game which had lots of solo content  -and group one too if you felt like it. It had  PVP also. Game was not bad as  i said but i left it after a few months. Main reasons being: Class skills were watered down -compared to EQs- graphics were too cartoony for my taste and last but not least community -on average- was far below EQs standards. And in MMOs community is the most important factor.  So no the game was not perfect but still it was a good MMO.,10,World of Warcraft is hands down one of the best if not the best RPG out there.Blizzard has definitely done a lot to this game and it has a gameplay to account for it.I and my friends will continue playing this game for a long long time.,10,i liked how the guy below me claming that wow doesn't have a "strong story". i was wondering why people giving this game low scores. Haha it's even funny that he said quests are so "generic". This game relased in 2004 and that quest system is what all mmo games have today. It may be "kill those" "bring these" quests but they have a lore in it. 12 years later this is what so many gamesi liked how the guy below me claming that wow doesn't have a "strong story". i was wondering why people giving this game low scores.

Pretty much everything is perfect. Unfortunately every expansion the fan base is left hanging for years. Another thing is getting to the  level cap a long tiring and sometimes boring journey and the price is quite honestly a bit overly expensive. All in all however World of warcraft is an excellent gameWhen you look at a game like World of Warcraft it is hard to explain in words. Pretty much everything is perfect.

All in all however World of warcraft is an excellent game and hopefully will last for sometime. I did not include the good things because they would be overflowing and reading about them may be somewhat useless as one once you play the free demo you find them.,6,This game was the best!!! until the end of Wrath of the lich king then it went downhill with bad expansions and less interference in the game just more time spend on the dungeon finder which kinda made the game less of a multiplayer i loved those days when you only went to raids once a month and a dungeon was so hard to find people for that it took at least a week to get in to.This game was the best!!! until the end of Wrath of the lich king then it went downhill with bad expansions and less interference in the game just more time spend on the dungeon finder which kinda made the game less of a multiplayer i loved those days when you only went to raids once a month and a dungeon was so hard to find people for that it took at least a week to get in to. stoped after cataclysm that was the worst ever....,10,Judging from the variety i would say 10/10  because has big content inside it. Judging from the storyline (yes this game has a storyline) i would say 10/10. Judging from the graphics( most MMO's dont need perfect graphics) i would say 8/10  Juding this game as a social game  a game that u can play with friends) i would say 9/10  About the subscription price i think is 9/10 good becauseJudging from the variety i would say 10/10  because has big content inside it.

PvP is not 100% balanced and its based on burst .Not everygame is perfect.,7,Kinda like it except that some some the quests are confusing and you get lost easily and sometimes it gets boring when there's not a lot of people in overall good game recommend to those mmorpg fans try the free version if you're interested in the game,6,Hmm....Considering it says just "World of Warcraft" I'm wondering if I should review what the game was or what it is now. I suppose I will touch into both a little. Vanilla WoW was one of the best games ever developed. It has turned into one of the most boring and lifeless MMOs you can find. The 40 man raids the challenge and the interactivity with other players was a huge plus butHmm....Considering it says just "World of Warcraft" I'm wondering if I should review what the game was or what it is now. I suppose I will touch into both a little. Vanilla WoW was one of the best games ever developed. It has turned into one of the most boring and lifeless MMOs you can find. The 40 man raids the challenge and the interactivity with other players was a huge plus but now they've dumbed down the game and recycled their ways over and over with every single expansion. The game is worth $15 a month and frankly back in the day it might have been worth it. However at this point you're paying for a game that is heavily struggling to stay afloat and has become a lifeless bore that is somehow very addicting. Don't buy it. I've played the game for years and I have hated what it has become. If you're looking for a Blizzard title buy Diablo 2 instead. Way cheaper as well.,5,Great fun to play with friends still the most playable and responsive mmo i have experienced. Do not get sucked into the end game content unless you enjoy not having a life outside of azeroth.,7,This IS a good game. A great game in fact. A BRILLIANT game in fact. There is just so much to do so much to explore this by far the best mmo rpg I have ever played EVER. You might think the game play becomes repetitive but it doesn't the quests are just SO different and if you get bored of questing you have raiding pvp and dungeon raiding with so much to do this game becomesThis IS a good game.

You might think the game play becomes repetitive but it doesn't the quests are just SO different and if you get bored of questing you have raiding pvp and dungeon raiding with so much to do this game becomes awesome fun and you will waste weeks of your life playing it. The graphics suits the game very well. There is obvious effort put into making this game. And then your subscription runs out. This game should not have a subscription fee it just feels like... To be honest Candy Crush Saga and it is the same story with ANY subscription fee game. The vanilla game should be completely free the only things you should have to pay for is the DLC as it makes perfect sense to give players an opportunity for a new challenge. The only problem with this game is the vanilla subscription fee but that is a VERY BIG problem it is also the main cause of hackers in this game. The game has all the aspects of a f2p but isn't.,8,Well writing a review about World of Warcraft is like stand at crossroads and think where to go. This game for sure took a big part in my life as well as in my heart. You may say that such games are waste of time but actually whole our life is a time killer... Anyway the game is amazing in many aspects! Blizzard tried to do so the player is fully immersed in the world of Warcraft.Well writing a review about World of Warcraft is like stand at crossroads and think where to go.

Blizzard tried to do so the player is fully immersed in the world of Warcraft. The soundtrack is beautiful piece of art that makes you feel every piece of this virtual world as if it was real. The visuals... it's a mind-blowing. The graphic artists done a lot of great work. You will be surprised many times during your travel how talented are the people who made this. Every location has it's own story and you starting to believe in it. The storyline also great. For all those priceless moments I got in this game I give 8 score. I can't give it 10 points because of it's gameplay. Many hours will be wasted on grinding especially on high levels. I don't like the concept of instances that ruins the integrity of the world. I don't like the casual PVP you can't lose your items so you don't feel much adrenaline in combats. The character inventory is boring. The world could be more interactive.,10,Almost 10 years on the market and still is the best MMORPG that you can find. The major problem about the bad reviews is that people still wants the game to be like Vanilla or complain about the graphics....,0,GIVE BACK WINDRUNNER   ༽つつ   GIVE BACK WINDRUNNER   ༽つつ   GIVE

believe the price is adequate 6) Sadly but recently all servers have been having lag (Probably because of the sheer amount of players) Overall: I would reccomend the game to somebody who is not new to the mmo genre as it can be complicated to play at higher levels requiring exact keystrokes or failure awaits :p,9,This is a very fun game! It's worth the monthly fee though I do have my doubts from time to time. It's a little hard to catch on to at first but it's really fun once you do. There's so much to do such as questing dungeons and PVP. The different classes are very well-made. It's not for everyone though. I recommend you try the starter version before committing to the monthly fee.This is a very fun game! It's worth the monthly fee though I do have my doubts from time to time.

This game is being tuned constantly to please its player base and they do listen to their players and hire out of their player base in some cases. The problem with WoW is its extremely time consuming So Blizzard has made it easier to acquire sub par gear such as LFR. I think with the time this game has been out Blizzard has been trying to keep up with new ideas buts it hard putting out and balancing the game in time for players won't get bored. Its a great game has its ups and downs. If your looking for a great PvP game WoW is prob the best if not top 3 the MMO world(In my opinion). If you wanna give the game a try go for it but if your planning on being just a casual I wouldn't say this is the game for you. I think its about time for WoW to upgrade its graphics which I believe would be hard(due to having a crap load of servers already) but its worth it imo.,3,I can see how this was a good game 10 years ago but it's absolutely out-dated and lacking everything a modern MMO should have nowadays. Paying 10$ monthly to play this game is ridiculous.,6,I played from Vanilla to Cataclysm and for me the game hit its high point in Wrath. After that the design ideas seemed to be pretty limited and repetitive. At this point the game really shows its age. Its time to fold up and create WOW 2; you cant keep milking the cash cow forever Blizzard (sorry Activision whoops sorry Vivendi).

Hey come to think of it the first really bad WOW expansion was the first wholly under control of Activision. Anyone think there might be a connection?,10,After all these years still a consistently amazing fascinating game. Excellent programming great tech support and literally and endless amount to do. Highly recommended,10,My favorite game of all time.  This beast was ahead of its time back in 2004 and still lives on 9 years later.  The art style and game engine have scaled extremely well.

They learn lessons every expansion and apply them to the next.  I've make sure to play every other MMO that comes out (Guild Wars 2 Rift Star Wars: The Old Republic ... the list goes on) but WoW is the golden standard they all have to compete with.  Other games are just minor distractions to this ever dominate KING.,9,My opinion is an opinion of player who played WoW for almost 4 years (2007-2011) spending over 2500 hours for it (and still never reaching the top tier armor or entering top guild). First of all WoW is always FUN! No matter how many time you spend and which sides of game you prefer.Second from the very beggining unlike most Korean MMOs developers tend to limit your timespendingMy opinion is an opinion of player who played WoW for almost 4 years (2007-2011) spending over 2500 hours for it (and still never reaching the top tier armor or entering top guild). First of all WoW is always FUN! No matter how many time you spend and which sides of game you prefer. Second from the very beggining unlike most Korean MMOs developers tend to limit your timespending by limiting maximum quantity of top tier dungeons and raids you can visit per day or per week respectively and doing about the same in PvP (limiting the number of top tier badges you can acquire per week). Ofcourse people who strive to play more go into grinding gathering crafting trading or runmultiple characters. Please don't spend your life playing videogames!Third Blizzard is constanly adding something new to the game. While back then in 2000's it required to reach max level indeed to have really enjoy the game now some many possibilities are added that you may enjoy the game from level 10 literally. While leveling also became much faster. It became possible to reach level 40 in one day without a severe grinding. Even faster if your acdcount is reffered to friend and you get leveling boost. Fourth it becomes really repetitive only in two occasions: 1) you agree for it yourself usually it refers to cases when you are grinding reputation for some exotic mounts usually takes between two weeks and one month and is never obligatory; 2) you are striving to be top tier in PvE but when you reach such ambitions you are most likely to integrate into community that much that repeatedness won't be a severe burden.Of course game will require time but there is no MMO which fits those who want to spend couple of hours once per week. Fifth you will be astounded how reach the RP and LORE part is now rich the story of Azeroth and neighbouring world is and outdated little grotesque graphics doesn't prevent enjoying the atmosphere. When you feel yourself a true hero of Azeroth which is imposied by long questlines it is difficult to compare with anything. You'll be wishing to come back again and again and then you will have a feeling of nostalgy about the game. And the last but not the least what really happened to the game over almost a decade? It became much easier what many old-school WoWers (incl. myself) found frustrating but for new players that must be good news! Thank you for spending your time reading my review I hope I have helped you to form your own opinion concerning the game. P.S.: I quit WoW in the late 2011 due to some circumstances but I really miss the game and often think of returning back to it.,5,Content: Stupid Blizzard Entertainment doesn't even care that we have to pay $15 a month anymore all they care about is $$$.

Guild Wars 2 is a HECK of a lot more fun than this game and that's only a one time pay game. The gameplay really is not bad but not worth all that cash.I give this game a 5/10.,10,It's an old game yes. The graphics are not top notch yes. But the huge world the millions of people and the rich lore gameplay and quests are all a 10 worth plus with the new expansion coming out soon.,6,World of Warcraft if looked at as an MMORPG is a fail it's very repetitive you fight boars at lvl 1-5 and fight boars yet again when you're high lvl over 50. The developers simply "borrow" ideas and concepts away from other places and put them into this game. 95% of the stuff in this game being uninteresting/boring/poorly made the RPG part of the game is especially poorly made sinceWorld of Warcraft if looked at as an MMORPG is a fail it's very repetitive you fight boars at lvl 1-5 and fight boars yet again when you're high lvl over 50. The developers simply "borrow" ideas and concepts away from other places and put them into this game. 95% of the stuff in this game being uninteresting/boring/poorly made the RPG part of the game is especially poorly made since 99% of the quests involve players going to point B from point A and killing an "X" amount of creatures thus making players want to skip this part of the game as fast as possible so they can get to the maximum level and start doing PvP the only brilliant part this game has to offer it used to have nice story as well inherited from Warcraft III: the frozen throne but they killed the main character(Arthas) and replaced him with pandas. I honestly don't know how people can pay tens of euros/dollars each month for just PvP and maybe some raids. One of the most overrated games ever the only reason I'm giving it a 6/10 is because of the PvP which is(was) fantastic unfortunately besides murdering Arthas they also murdered any fun players with rogues could have had even on PvP servers by making infiltration in enemy capitals useless and with 0 fun had thanks to the whining of players and the stupidity of the developers.,5,Heroic dungeons that a rogue can tank rare bosses that are harder to kill than heroic bosses Blizzard still babysitting the horde in PvP - which is still stupidly imbalanced... there's no challenge to be found unless you're one of the "common core" kids that they dumbed the game down for.

The monthly subscription @ 50 cents a day aint' so bad but buying the expansions is a waste of money all things considered. If you are a serious gamer I don't suggest you buy this one. League of Legends has way better PvP and several MMO's have more challenging quests and PvE - and are free to play! Do your research before you buy - it's becoming a ghost town - merging servers and whatnot to hide the mass exodus from incompetent developers and designers who miraculously ruined one of the most awesome games I ever played (past tense of course).,8,I used to like this game in its beginnings but as soon as i found it was a necessity to make part of a guild that   more than not rejects you and gives you no loot making you stall into the game begging for a raid i totally broke for me.,10,Well this is one of the greatest games of all time not as fun as the old days but still great!

(not many people even know this game has a story :P) and it's sad that there's no more pvp they say it will be fixed with legion and I hope so pvp was amazing! so was pve. and I don't like how they've made it over violence the wotlk was fine and even mop was fine!

The game allows for individuals who enjoy gaming to immerse themselves in an imaginary world in which they can be whatever they want in some cases as some have stated you can become the douche bag elitist who spent more time on developing a character this is indeed sad.  We all have our faults! Can't get over the annoying ones in chat Blizzard has always allowed the option for you to /ignore or simply block channels in chat.  The game allows for a lot of time yes it is addictive to some this is good if you do not enjoy outdoor activities the SUN or simply loathe actual human interaction. It is a huge TIME SINK you will grow out of it and wonder what the hell happened to the last X amount of years. The game has indeed been "dumbed" down. Is it for a new generation of player or profits? who knows fact is if your shaking your head yes you have grown out of it and are probably going to work or to change the babies diaper get over it ! The game is not for us anymore. With all of that said I made many friendships that I still have years after I quit the game why am i reading reviews ?…Think of it as that jerk from High school you hated …probably looked them up on Facebook didn't you?  The biggest con i can say about WoW is they took a lot of the human interaction out of the game…you no longer need to stand for hours in your capital city and ask for groups…you simply click a button and go along your merry way until a loud noise scares the crap out of you to tell you your group is ready and your whisped away to fight moderately annoying monsters …cause everyone is like Uber leetsauce now and like can solo hogger  the game has been around for 12 years or so. Take it with a grain of salt you can play for free up to level 20 nothing lost well you will have to install and uninstall (which takes anywhere from 8 hours to a week depending your internet speed) …once again ITS ALL ABOUT TIME how much are you willing to waste?,8,This game has been a personal favorite since Orcs & Humans entered the field of vision. My uncle offered me the game and it was fairly brilliant. My favorite level was the third in human campaign. When Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness had been released a friend of mine spent hours building each other levels to defeat. Needless to say I've been a fan of Blizzard for a long time.

My favorite level was the third in human campaign. When Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness had been released a friend of mine spent hours building each other levels to defeat. Needless to say I've been a fan of Blizzard for a long time. The third although originally I found less interesting as it pieced itself together I became enamored with the lore which lead me to buy the game.I started off tanking which was simple in vanilla but rocked the house as it went on after removing myself from tanking I played fury and did badass dps. In Wotlk I was listed in the top 13 of my server where I had tons of fun and unfortunately for degrading social "economics" I have few friends left that I still talk to every day from this game but the friends I made in this game have twice as much value as the people I have met in real life. Many people would call this a lack of life but where they have supported me my own family has failed. Even if I have never met any of them the people I met during the Wotlk arc are some of the most valuable people I will ever meet. I am proud to have met them. Furthermore my subsequent involvements with this game and its functioning through my life are genuinely more faithful than some other people I have met in my life. Trolling aside the connections I made and lost are invaluable there is no other game I would rather spend playing during my time online. Especially since many are jokingly far worse or at least until recently had a poorer social interaction. I guess that is my only complaint the trolls took over gaming and the classic friendly player is no longer available because of being shut down and shying away from the public. Thanks for being a great game.,10,This game is amazing! It's nearly 11 years old and even comparing it to games in the year 2016 it holds it's own. This is the MMO that all others are compared. No game has even come close to it despite all the hype over the years. I read a ridiculous comment below that this game has no real PVP?!?!?! I have been a hard core pvper for 10 years!

This is the MMO that all others are compared. No game has even come close to it despite all the hype over the years. I read a ridiculous comment below that this game has no real PVP?!?!?! I have been a hard core pvper for 10 years! I play on 2 pvp servers and  I've tried pvp on so many other games I can't count them all and I always come back to Warcraft. There is so much to do and so much content. If you don't like pvp that's ok there is a decades worth of pve over 16000 quests mount farming professions raiding realm jumping. You can play with anyone who plays this game no matter where they are in the world or what server they are on. Even better if you are a new player not only have all the bugs been fixed when you start playing the world is exponentially bigger than when I started.  If you love story the story lines are amazing and so in depth and detailed. There are also books based on the game and discuss the story and lore.  I personally have always found the expansions appealing. I know that goes against the internet trash talkers who unrealistically think that a company can please millions of people all at once. Maybe I'm just old and keep reality in perspective. I love this game and I will keep playing until I don't. Ten years and the love is still alive. I was upset when I saw that one of the most influential most successful longest lasting games ever made had a 93/100 score I was dumbfounded. Then I noticed Skyrim which I played has a 96 so scores are obviously out the window. World of Warcraft is easily 100/100 for me. For The Alliance!!!,9,I remember playing this back in the days... Good gold days with the friends. Nowadays the game kinda lowered the fun a little bit by adding lfr and dungeon finder there isn't much more social activity. Still best MMO RPG ever created  they really put a lot of work in Legion.,9,I honestly think that most of the guys that come here to post review between 0-3 never **** played the game for more than 2hr or just hate it for some stupid reason. Pathetic.,7,Szomorú vagyok mert ez a játék nem 10 évvel ezelőtt talált meg. Sajna csak mostanában próbáltam ki a játékot de valószínűleg gyerekként odáig lettem volna érte.
