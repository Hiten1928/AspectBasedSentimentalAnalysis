However the game's ARCADE mode is pretty fun to goof off in with your friends submitting player made maps to create scenarios which I could see being an additional few hours of content. Also these little events are a decent thing to do when you have a slow day and decide to do them to get any cosmetic or different weapon skins.I do Like it how the devs are bringing back Far Cry 3 in the season pass. However you could access FC3 at May 29th 2018 and DLCs April 2018. The upcoming DLCs seems to be interesting twists in the American setting my most favorite is the Vietnam DLC and the Mars one. For a 60 dollar game I could recommend this game to a friend that enjoys completing the games 100% I know that I did enjoy the game and the Story.,8,While the gameplay is good there are quite a few problems on the design department. CUTSCENESUbisoft still doesn't understand that cutscenes are meant to give information to players. 90% of this game's cutscenes have no content as in nothing useful is said.

The characters in them simple spout the same few lines over and over with different words. This is probably meant to "build characters" but having them doing the same thing over and over spouting nonsense isn't what I call a good use of my time. Usually I watch all the cutscenes in a game (on the off chance there is usable information there) but in this game I just had to start bypassing them. Cutscenes in Far Cry 5 are completely useless. MAGIC BULLETSI vehemently hate the person(s) who designed the marked or hunted "missions". They are the antithesis of open world and they don't even make sense in the context of the game. You are doing something (as in you have something you want to do) but then people just come up to you with magic bullets and capture you. No chance of getting away from that. In the context of the game that would be the end of the game. Personally I've killed thousands of those cultists. So if they would capture me they wouldn't let me live.,10,90 % of the people here haven't played the game because most of them say the game mechanics are identical to far cry 34primal and they are all lying.

Extremely funny game and after the latest patch the AI is much better. If you are a Far Cry fan you will like this game definetely,7,This is your basic Far Cry game - nothing more nothing less. The assault rifle's accuracy is terrible and it's not just because of bullet drop. You're basically not able to hit the broad side of a barn from 100 meters away. The rounds aren't just affected by the force of gravity but apparently also by the rotation of the earth and extreme crosswinds/mini-cyclones. The bow and arrow onThis is your basic Far Cry game - nothing more nothing less. The assault rifle's accuracy is terrible and it's not just because of bullet drop. You're basically not able to hit the broad side of a barn from 100 meters away. The rounds aren't just affected by the force of gravity but apparently also by the rotation of the earth and extreme crosswinds/mini-cyclones. The bow and arrow on the other hand is extremely accurate in that the arrows are only affected by gravity which is basically linear across distance. The graphics are great on PC and the game runs flawlessly on an i7-8700K. The world is also meticulously crafted and immersive. The only major drawback is the frequent cutscene hijacking. They've done this in all the FarCrys but they really laid it on thick in this one. It's pretty common to be meandering along aimlessly and then suddenly get pulled into some boring cutscene where you're forced to listen to some lengthy monologue from one of the game's villains. These will often culminate in some sort of battle royale with real or imagined persons or apparitions respectively. It's frustrating and grating. Also I originally rated this game as an 8/10 but had to knock it down to a 7/10 after playing it for several more hours and experiencing the unusually and unnecessarily short campaign. The game really tries to rush you through the main story. In fact it's the only game I've ever played where I found that I was progressing way faster than I actually thought I was (if that makes any sense at all). For example missions don't necessarily advance the story and push you forward to "boss battles." By this I mean merely killing NPCs advances your progress meter in a given area of the game and once it hits a certain number then you're cutscene hijacked to a boss battle. It doesn't take a particularly long time to fill up those progress meters either. You could conceivably finish this game in twelve hours. The reason why this is odd is because the world is pretty big (not Witcher 3 big but big nonetheless) so it's not clear to me why the developers wanted to "Call of Duty" the campaign length. They had plenty of digital real estate to work with and there's a lot of side missions so it's not like they didn't have voice actors on hand. It's like the writers and the map developers worked in completely separate installations and never communicated about their respective visions. Also the villains and characters are basically never developed at all and this is entirely because of the remarkably short campaign length. It's by far the shortest campaign from any of the Far Crys. Also I agree with others that have noted that you'll encounter enemies every 100 yards roughly. Not so much whilst ambling about the woods but definitely on the road way. I think if you pay an extra ten bucks for the "deluxe edition" you get a helicopter with machine guns and rockets equipped from the moment you're able to access a helicopter (which is very early on). That's not a small advantage either. The helicopter essentially allows you to rain death down on your enemies from on high with infinite ammo. With no helicopter you're essentially fighting them off with a musket or bow and arrow (see first paragraph). You're AI partners will come in handy - so far I've unlocked the archer (female can't remember name) and a grenadier named "Herk." They're both equally useful in their own right. Anyway I recommend the game particularly if you've enjoyed past Far Crys.,7,Well it has been a while since i bourght the last video game. Far Cry 3 had been fun but the player character and the "good" people had been atrocious and cringeworthy to play as.

Far Cry 3 had been fun but the player character and the "good" people had been atrocious and cringeworthy to play as. No character customization made it a rather unpleasent game to play in terms of wanting to actually be that character. Then there were the absolutely terrible boss battles .. serious let downs with repetitive QTE events and dull endurance sequences. Now .. this is Far Cry 5 .. aaaand .. it feels pretty much uh .. the same. As a matter of fact i can hardly separate it from Ghost Recon Wildlands in terms of structure. A large worldmap (not near as large as Wildlands though) that is fairly pretty to look at. (again Wildlands looks better for the scenery but in terms of detail Far Cry 5 appears to be nicer)  .. both games have rather terrible AI with enemies that can easily be "trapped" at doorways . and throw themselves into a bottleneck situation in what can only be described as pure suicide. The vehicles feel good so far the mini-missions are standard. Now is there anything outstanding? ... Not really. The story is OK-ish .. about on a level of a heap 80s action movie. You are good they are bad .. go kill thousands of them cause you are GOOD! (and not a psychopatic mass murderer at all) .. no chance to seek a diplomatic or peaceful solution (but its not that kind of game .. ) Well at least there is a limited character customization and the player character is bland enough (in a positive way) that he/she is not a total jerk like Far Cry 3. However .. the game lives and falls with its bad guy. And i just dont feel it. It might be kind of a ballsy move to make the bad guys white religious right wing fundamentalists ... but they are not near as exciting as this one pirate guy from Far Cry 3 .. its actually about as bland as the bad guy(s) from Wildlands. But the game runs well looks pretty and offers good action game mechanics for a semi open world game on what feels like a fairly small area. Well above average but not outstanding.,5,Pros: A truly immersive game setting story premise NPC personality depth music antagonist personality and back story. Cons: The story was either lazily written or it was chopped up due to time constraints.

Extremely annoying and all too often no way out scenarios that result in you feeling frustrated and annoyed. I would be singing this games praise but for a few things that have turned an otherwise amazing experience completely sour. Far Cry 5 could have and should been the best of the far cry games so far but due to either sloppy and very lazy writing or horrible production it's the worst. The premise of the story is excellent but the execution of it is atrocious. I'll try very hard not to include spoilers but suffice it to say they make the protagonist and the antagonist not only impotent but stupid as well. I have never seen a story either so lazily written or so horribly rushed. It makes no logical sense. The story pins the protagonist into a no win scenario time and time again giving the antagonist opportunity after opportunity to end the conflict. Once or twice would have been fine but it gets tedious and annoying after 20 times. Do the antagonists act on those opportunities? Take a guess. To add insult to injury it resorts to the use of deus ex machina to get him out. It reeks of rushed and cut story or amateurish writing. The game play is standard far cry albeit without the towers. The graphics are beautiful and the setting is amazing. The music is wonderful and probably the best part of the game. All of these things add up to what should have been the best game of 2018 but with the no win scenarios every 20 minutes it ruins it. TL;DR: They botched this either due to bad writers or a moronic production team. If you don't care about the story making no logical sense this is a great game.,7,Really stunning gfx.But the theme just doesnt do it for me.The pace of this game is slow and doesnt keep me interested.,2,The game has a bug for many people that sticks you with eternal night.

I don't care how many people worked on this game and how much effort they expended--if you guys don't care about the players enough to fix this kind of thing ASAP you get a 1 (Edit: now a 2 see below). Edit: I would have upgraded this to a 7 or 8 if it were fixed.  But it's been weeks now and Ubi still hasn't even claimed to have a fix for it. A patch came out and very few of the big bugs people have reported were fixed. The game is broken and Ubi doesn't care. I'm leaving it as a 1. Edit 2: Honestly I'm not sure I'd even go as high as an 8 even without the bugs. It's just not that great a game. The story is tedious and obvious and very cowardly when it comes to dealing with the actual issues at hand in the subject matter. Horizon Zero Dawn was somewhat criticized for taking their format largely from Far Cry but honestly they did it far better with a much more robust codebase a far superior and much more detailed and moving story and just a better experience overall. If you want content like this but clean and good and produced by people and a company that desperately care about getting things right play HZD instead. Edit 3: I've finished the game. The ending is absolutely terrible. It makes you wish you hadn't bothered. And in case you've been led to believe otherwise there's really only one ending. There are three ways the game can end but only one is really an ending. Don't think you might get a better one. Still I kinda fell in love with some of the soundtrack so I'm going to be undeservedly generous and bump this up to a 2 but only because they commissioned some really lovely music.,5,Well Ubisoft have no idea how to pace their gameplay anymore. Far Cry 5 never gives you a moment of peace it just gives you constant chaos.

Far Cry 5 never gives you a moment of peace it just gives you constant chaos. You're constantly being attacked or doing the attacking yourself and no-matter where you are there is always action going on around you. There are always people chasing you people screaming for your help and you quickly get inundated with more missions than you know what to do with. There's always someone calling you over for a side mission multiple voices speaking at once advising you to do a thousand different things while gunshots crack through the air all around you and explosions go off in the distance. It's just a sensory overload of multiple activities happening at once all the time with little meaning behind any of them. The problem with this design philosophy is that if all a game offers me is constant action how can I be expected to keep appreciating that for 30 hours? There has to be a balance and there has to be downtime. Downtime gives the action meaning because it keeps things surprising it keeps things interesting and it gives you time to breathe. It lets you explore and take in the scenery collect yourself and prepare for the next encounter. If all that exists in a game is constant action then the action doesn't really mean anything. The action quickly gets stale because there's nothing to supplement it. Consequently Far Cry 5 is predictable and repetitive and it didn't take long before I found it to be utterly exhausting. Don't get me wrong it's an adequate game I suppose. Everything works as intended and the gameplay at its core is still fun it's just that the design is so damn cluttered which just drags everything down so hard. I'll pick out a few things I like... I like that the radio towers are gone. I like that crafting is more incidental now and can be mostly ignored which is a nice surprise from Ubisoft these days. I like that they added a way to choose your sex at the start but I'm not sure why they bothered because they put very little effort into it (if you choose female characters will still refer to you by male pronouns). Apart from that though it's just another Far Cry game. The same thing all over again in a different location except this time Ubisoft's obsession with filling the map with "stuff to do" and "things happening" has reached critical mass to the point where none of it is even the slightest bit immersive or engaging.,7,PROS:1.

No mini-map also plus in my book (it kinda makes you to be more aware of your surroundings)7. Optimization is not bad (totally better than AC: Origins was on a release) CONS:1. Sometime AI is just terrible and super dumb2. Story is "meh" and the characters of the game are not so memorable (comparing with FC3 or even FC4 - pagan min was awsome)3. There are some few annoying bugs4. Game's world sometimes is way too chaotic - you can't drive in a new area calmly for even 2 minutes without encountering lots of random enemies then bear attacks you out of nowhere then helicopters starts shooting rockets at you then reinforcements come etc. So If you want to travel calmly you need to do it in the woods by foot.5. This game lacks of guns. There's only about two proper assault rifles - AR-C and AK-M and those too also aren't so good too.6. Those f*****g microtransactions. Although you simply can buy everything with in-game currency the prices for weapons and cars (boats planes) skins are insanely high.7. No more crafting. Instead of that you have to make lots of stupid challenges to get perk points and with those you can unlock new abilities like extra gun slot carry more ammo swim faster walk silently etc. (sp for example: you wanna get 3 perk points? kill 15 enemies with flamethrower wanna get another 2 or 3 points? hunt down 3 grizzlies etc...). I haven't tried co-op although I've read lots of forum about how stupid it is when someone joins friend's game there's no story progression no guns progression etc... For me Far Cry always been about singleplayer and I still think it's worth buying it. You'll get lots of different quests great gameplay there's really a lot of doing in this game. EDIT: Those gamers who says it's too easy put difficulty on hard turn off x-ray vision and indicators as well. Then the gameplay for example liberating outposts will be pain in the ass no joke.,10,Incredible graphics great combat huge amount of content and an interesting story. How are people upset at this?,
