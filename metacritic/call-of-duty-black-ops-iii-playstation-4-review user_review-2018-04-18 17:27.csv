Dear Activision Black ops 3 is "TOILET" nothing more than a revamp of Black ops 2 with an odd tweek spent over £70 with the DLC what a waste of money people slated Advanced warfare it is a masterpiece by comparison I have given you a big fat ZERO and this is what it deserves. SO VERY DISAPPOINTED,0,I know COD is an arcade shooter for consoles but the lack of care the developers has done to this franchise is boring and repetitive. Call of Duty has been milked to death.,0,Cod 3 is the absoulte worst game ever. the flying and running on walls in completely **** retarded.i personally feel that cod one was the best one. i wish i could i return this game because it is honestly **** terrible. never again will i even try another call of duty.,4,Call of Duty as brought nothing new to the entire genre. First-person shooters haven't innovated at all. This game shows it clearly. Titanfall had it first. Not only that but the campaign sucks and the multiplayer is bland. Never have I seen such a putrid mess.,0,You kill people for XP. It gets pretty boring very fast. ;)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))),0,This is one of the worst call of duty ever. I don't understand how the critics rate it 8/10? The franchise is going backward gone are the days when $1b sales were expected. Now the company probably doesn't even make $100m thus sales figures are not public anymore. It's sad how the game is going down the drain.,4,It's alright. It's definitely not worthy of anything above a 7 but it's certainly not a 2 either. For starters the campaign is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. The story is just ... Nauseating and it is much the same story with the Black Ops series as a whole. Treyarch couldn't write a story worth telling if their studio depended on it.Multiplayer is slightly betterIt's alright.

Nauseating and it is much the same story with the Black Ops series as a whole. Treyarch couldn't write a story worth telling if their studio depended on it. Multiplayer is slightly better however only slightly. I was disappointed to see they followed in Advanced Warfare's foot-steps with the "exo-suit" movement. Along with that the sheer amount of unlocks attachments wildcards perks etc is ridiculous and unnecessary. Perks in particular are fragmented in such a way that you'd need three perks to accomplish what one could get you back in MW2. All-in-all it's alright. Nothing special and it certainly adds nothing to the series. Definitely not worth the $60 price tag $20-30 maybe.,1,The worst game I've played on PS4 so far. It's  awful don't waste your money. I haven't played a Call of Duty game in a while and this game is way too cheesy. The maps are also tiny and there isn't much at all to this game. It's definitely a game for the simple minded. Waste of time. Zombie's is also the biggest joke ever it isn't scary whatsoever. I think this may be a game for small children.,4,For as long as I've been playing Call of Duty since Modern Warfare the series has had it's ups and downs. Despite Black Ops 1 being my personal favorite in the series my love for the series quickly died once Black Ops 2 came out in 2012. Since then I prayed that this game would capture that magic it had. Sadly it failed for multiple reasons. Campaign:In terms of story andFor as long as I've been playing Call of Duty since Modern Warfare the series has had it's ups and downs. Despite Black Ops 1 being my personal favorite in the series my love for the series quickly died once Black Ops 2 came out in 2012. Since then I prayed that this game would capture that magic it had. Sadly it failed for multiple reasons. Campaign: In terms of story and characters this game would have to be one of the weakest games in the series. The story is boring there are only a few faces you can choose from to create your character the graphics just looks and sounds the same and the characters are not so likable or memorable as in the previous games. The dialogue is okay but it doesn't help grabs the players attention or make the campaign feel fresh and original. What we got is the same game but in a different setting little changes and less fun. If you were hoping this would be the game to save the franchise your sadly mistaken. And although the new Nightmare mode plays a lot like the campaign the twist is that there are zombies and has you play as a different character from the campaign. So basically your just really playing through the same boring missions all over from the campaign but with zombies no new weapons no pack a punch and no new features. Multiplayer: The multiplayer is not that great either. The game did really bad at launch due to it's ridiculous glitches and bad gameplay. The microtransactions is still there since Advanced Warfare to force the player to grind and play the game for hours in order to receive new weapons camo and other goodies. The supply drop suck and are hard to get anything special the gameplay is even worse due to it's broken hit boxes and some of the weapons either suck or are decent. The maps are okay and they did fix the controls compared to Advanced Warfare but the game modes are still the same and there's nothing special about this game mode at all. One of the least things I like about it is the addition of specialists. Instead of having to create your own character like you would normally do you are given instead a couple meh characters to customize. There's also Dead Ops Arcade 2 which did make a fine comeback since 2010 but it's kinda boring and not that rewarding either. Zombies: Zombies mode was a good way to end the separate storyline. Despite that there are only a few maps some of the maps are actually pretty cool and entertaining as well. The zombies are harder this time there are a tons of creatures to slay and more added weapons. This is probably the only good mode in the game because where all the other modes are either repetitive or just bad this is actually fun if you have enough friends to play along with you and once you get to know everything. Overall what we got is the same game every year but with lack of surprises little changes and very little fun. On top of that this is probably one of the worse story modes or one of the worse games in the series that fails to deliver with a bad ending bad characters bad modes and slightly worse multiplayer,7,I do not understand why someone would just give black ops a 0 thats just meaningless and disrupts the real reviews out there.

I have not played call of duty for a while due to really bad reviews but i can not seem to understand what they are doing so wrong. Sadly i will not give more than 7/10. The Multiplayer part of the game is still a bit dull but i love the new customization features of the weapons. I also love zombies and thats my main argument for buying this game. Call of duty: Zombies could be an own title with all these maps refurbished sometime and i would certainly give that more than 7/10... If you liked the other call of duty games this game is for you. Go buy it! If your not quite sure yet just wait for the sales. But if you do not like the game at all just stay clear of the game AND the reviews. Peace out!,5,This is the worst call of duty there is. They tried to take elements from other games like Titanfalls wall running and Destinys ability's by doing so they took something that worked great in those games and ruined how call of duty feels.

The map's are unpolished and cartoony. Everything looks just a bit to bright and to rounded off. The small map sizes and blocked off areas make it very hard to enjoy the multiplayer experience. The advertisements for this game were extremely misleading. For a "Most Anticipated" game I was expecting so much more. Don't get me wrong it's still fun but it's no more fun than Destiny or Battlefield and if I have more friends online playing those games I wouldn't hesitate jump off.  Speaking of Destiny the specialist system and double jumps are a totally borrowed from it. I will put a bit more time into it and see what the other specialists offer but I don't expect this game to sit on my shelf much into December if even that long. The hype for this game was to much for the product we were given. This franchise is dead and needs to move on.,0,A post-modern piece of trash - MGSV with its cut chapter 3 and diluted chapter 2 is a far better investment even if it's a different genre. I guess Activision can rely on taking money from the ninõs rata year upon year much like EA sports.,0,If you didn't like previous COD's you also wont like this game. Talk about using the same old tired old formula over and over and over and over. If a franchise ever needed to die it's this one. Don't fall for the glowing reviews from the 'critics'. I'd bet money the critic reviews are nothing more than paid advertising. You've been warned.,0,Poorly written mess of a campaign lack of variety with the zombies mode offering poorly balanced multiplayer with higher level players being given way too much advantage.

Oh wait it;s an Activision Game so not surprising,0,Lags really badly on PC. PS4 is at fault for seeing PC as a threat and sabotaging it on PC. GG Treyarch.

It ain't fallout 4. The game adds nothing new to the franchise its just like every cod title rinse and repeat Rinse and repeat.

On the other hand Zombies is phenomenal....it could be a separate game in itself. The single player campaign takes risks and tells a compelling intriguing and most importantly unique story that isnt the same rehashed **** At the end of the day I actually love sitting down and playing this game...a feeling I don't always get even from those highly critically acclaimed "did every aspect of the game right" kinda games. I am impressed with what Treyarch did with this game and being my favorite COD developer they definitely met my expectations. I don't even want to call the reviewers on here trolls...they are more like broken recorders. Even if COD went through the comment section and fixed everything that was making people mad they would still complain about how it comes out every year or how the graphics suck or how the only thing you do is shoot people or whatever other absurd unjustified **** they can think of.  In all honestly I would give this game an 8.5 (more towards a 9 than an 8) merely for the fact that there have been slight lag issues occasionally but they have not been game breaking by any means. My one gripe with this game is the graphics. Come on Treyarch you guys are working with two new powerhouse machines...you guys should be able to deliver some really nice graphical touches to your games. All in all this is a very fun COD the best since Black Ops 2. I would put it behind MW MW2 and BLOPS but it easily one of the best games in the overall franchise. And don't listen to the 4.7 user score- even if some of the points made by the negative reviewers are valid no game this big deserves a friggen zero or a one (which is what a majority of the reviews are giving it).,0,The control on this game is so broken it's almost impossible to play. The servers are so bad that some people have laser fast hit connects while others will not be able to hit anyone no matter how early they get the drop. This leads to absolute frustration.

I know other players from past COD versions are hitting at the same rate which confirms it for me. I have a blazing fast system but even with everything turned down low no dice. It's like I am wearing a magnetic vest with people shooting before I even round a corner and then I walk into their already fired bullet. So broken. Be warned!,3,It could've been a fun game but the fact that people near servers (when you have the chance to hit dedi and not the usual p2p) have 0.5 to 1 sec advantage over you is a game changer. The campaign looks sounds and plays great however this is the most terrible story in any single player game I've ever played.,7,Is this another same **** as the year before? No. Is it fun to play? Yes. Can it get stupid sometimes?.....Yes. I can safely say this is Advanced Warfare done right. The thruster pack parkour can be really fun but with the enclosed space in both campaign and multiplayer I found them to be pointless. Campaign is rather forgettable.

You are either really good or terrible. There is no middle area. Zombies on the other hand is really fun to play. Maybe it's because it's the only game mode that does not have thruster pack therefore keeping the traditional gameplay or due to the fact that setting is in Noir style Chicago but they really did a great job with Zombies,4,I had been waiting for years since black ops 2 for this game to arrive only to be let down.

I honestly don't know how they let this happen. So disappointed Treyarch :(,3,Not fun.  Story is confusing and impossible to follow.  The "auto-teleport" when playing the campaign in co-op mode is jarring and completely unnecessary.  Multiplayer is flat and lifeless.  Guns all sound the same in my headphones. I like the background music... when it decides to kick in.  Time-to-Kill is too quick.  Combine that with the tiny map sizes and there is this quick-deathNot fun.  Story is confusing and impossible to follow.  The "auto-teleport" when playing the campaign in co-op mode is jarring and completely unnecessary.  Multiplayer is flat and lifeless.  Guns all sound the same in my headphones. I like the background music... when it decides to kick in.  Time-to-Kill is too quick.  Combine that with the tiny map sizes and there is this quick-death spawn die routine that is difficult to break.  The new wall running mechanics are nothing but a gimmick. I would prefer a more useful double jump that offered more verticality in the maps.  "Supers" for the new specialists are also pointless.  Gravity Spikes Tempest and Sparrow are often futile because an opposing player can kill you with their primary weapon before you are able to complete the kill.  I was happy that launchers have been made relevant but that is one of the few.  I actually miss Advanced Warfare after playing this game.  Wait for the price drop or Redbox it for the weekend to see what you think.,5,Black Ops 3 isn't a masterpiece but the Zombie mode is something new with the new things u can do there and the new monsters. Its really funny to play it with some friends. Yeah the multiplayer: I dont see a any difference to AW for me the gameplay is same OK u dont have the double jump but at all its same.

I've played pretty much every Call of Duty game and with COD AW it went somewhere that I didn't like at all even though I did like the UI/menu. After that game I just feared that the moaners had there way of trying to change a working recipe.

Multiplayer show most players liking core TDM or Domination but I'm a fan of CTF and I've spent 99% of my time playing that mode. I feels smooth and quick but not stupid COD AW quick. The wall running is done well as to the double jump. There is the usual dsync moments you get with every FPS game.  The aim asset is alot less than it was in the beta or it might be broken on mine as I never notice it instead I notice a lot in killcams people potato aiming.I play a little zombies with 2 other mates and one random person. It's just as good as the old Black ops 1 days. Good looking game mode with moments of WTF is happening and where are those damn zombies coming from. Many laughs had and we truly enjoyed it.I've played up to mission 4 on campaign with one friend in Co-op and we again had fun. We played on Hardcore difficulty as we wanted to have fun and not get too frustrated but at the same time have some difficulty. The story might be good but playing with a friend we spent most cut scenes talking about how great they looked instead of listening to the dialog. So far I'm enjoying it and I can't wait to jump on it again.Conclusion: Epic game and why am I here instead of pew pewing it on Black ops 3.,0,I bought the game but it was unplayable despite going through the online help "fixes".   In the end I had to take it back to the store for a refund.  Worst gaming experience of my life...,0,WTF sad. Its like they dont give a **** about gameplay. Worst cod period.

But to complain about buying this after the fact. Its the same game every year an they'll keep making if your all dumb enough to purchase it.,1,Absolute trash. I’ve seen this game before in Black Ops I and II with a little Advance Warfare running on the walls. All the money you have made over the years and still no dedicated servers. Not to mention 3 kill streaks locked in per game instead of per class. 8 total perks/attachments again really!!! with higher ranked able to use better weapons.

But in every game I die over and over from lag kills. The two ways that 80% or more of my deaths go are: I drop dead and then get to see that an enemy player came around a corner and killed me before he existed on my end or I put an entire clip into an enemy with hit markers and then he kills me with a single burst. Even if a game starts off well it will almost always go to pot halfway. I've had innumerable games where I have a 4-5KD at the half and my team is winning but after the half I get insta-killed from lag comp every time I meet anyone and finish with a 1KD and we lose the game. It's the most inconsistent lag filled game I've ever played. Nothing else matters if shots don't count and if players aren't synced up. To rebut those who would say it's my skill (skill has nothing to do with getting killed before the enemy exists on screen) I have a ~2.5 kd and even in this broken game I'm managing a 1.9 but it is no fun at all. I'd rather have a 1kd and have the game actually work. I want to lose to a better player not a broken game.,2,This installment of the declining Call of Duty franchise is yet another proof that CoD is becoming a lackluster and repetitive chore.

The last CoD that my friends and I genuinely enjoyed was Black Ops 2 as it provided original chaotic and ingenious gameplay with NEW mechanics an ENGAGING story and ORIGINAL design. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. Same Expansion strategy exploiting the dullards who still play these games. As a CoD BO3 continues a franchise with the same repetitive gameplay from 3 years ago and if you enjoy dull gameplay go ahead and purchase this game. However if you are looking for an actual good FPS might as well bide your time,7,First. If you give this game a 1 star you are a loser. Now comparing to all previous call of duty games in the last 5 years black ops 3 is extremely well. Game play feel responsive tight and accurate.

Furthermore the game had me bored right from start to the abrupt finish I gave it after I uninstalled the game and requested a refund after the first mission and one multiplayer match. (I played about 2 hours of multiplayer in the beta and the game felt exactly the same on release.) Terrible game dying series with developers and publishers not knowing what made the first games so great. Realistic weapons and clothing over the top stories and cool set pieces that don't require robotic limbs. Example: Laying in a field with a patrol walking right past you in MW was more fun than the last 3 COD games combined.,0,A game that is all about the multiplayer but has that component in an unplayable state in multiple regions especially for the PS4 users. Not only that there's no sign of the creators admitting to the problem as they continue the usual routine of blaming the thousands of user's connections instead of their servers. Stay away from this game. If you own a PS4 just run away as fast as you can.,5,More  of the same. These yearly franchises sometimes feel more like expansions than actual full gledged games. This series symbolizes everything wrong with gaming today. While it's not terrible it's far from great. Fans will love it everyone else will be meh about it.,0,Cod with the same old repetitive gameplay. this time they failed  to offer anything new. the classes are all from either destiny or titan fall just re skinned and renamed. and class ability works worse than they do on the games they are originally from. the maps are a mess. they are either too small for the number of players on them which results in  being able to blinding shoot the gunCod with the same old repetitive gameplay. this time they failed  to offer anything new. the classes are all from either destiny or titan fall just re skinned and renamed. and class ability works worse than they do on the games they are originally from. the maps are a mess. they are either too small for the number of players on them which results in  being able to blinding shoot the gun and get kills in the 2 second before your respawn. the larger maps  with choke points are basically older maps that have ben modified. supposed to to promote  team play play and give it a more tactical feel it doesn't people just run and gun in that too. it suffers from a lot of the same issues as others pointed out with the new need for speed.  mainly the repetitive same old game play as previous releases and reskinned rehashed content from previous versions or in this case two other games as well. I wish I could get some of the activision money that was paid to reviewers for the goods reviews the game doesn't deserve.,0,Same recycled garbage.  Don't get caught in the trap.

Black Ops 3 is a tough decision for me in terms of rating.  In terms of the campaign it has a bland start that had me asking a lot of fundamental questions that should have been better answered just by playing the game.  It isn't until mission 4 that things start to heat up a bit in terms of the fun-factor but the story is still a bit buried.  Then around the halfway mark things start to click and Black Ops 3 takes off on a roller coaster ride that I've come to expect from this arm of the franchise.  The ending had me asking a lot of questions but when I sought out answers it made a LOT of sense and makes me understand why certain events in the game transpired the way they did (AFTER you’ve beaten the campaign read the very first quick-scroll mission statement text that appears during those black screens.  They’re on YouTube and if you slow it down to 25% play speed you can play/pause your way through it and find an extremely interesting piece of info there.  Again AFTER you beat the game go find this).  There is some room for interpretation but the theories I arrived at connected all the dots extremely well.  Do not judge this story until you've done this for yourself or you'll stamp poor writing in spots that are actually clever writing.  The scope of the gameplay while unfolding the story is a nice addition but the added wall running and thrust jumping take a back seat more often and it's the DNI augmentations that give a soldier super-human powers that really shines here.  For the campaign it nearly blew me away from start to end but the fractured first few missions pulls it out of "amazing" territory and into the "above-average" category.  I haven't spent much time with zombies but I will say this: beating the campaign is important as it unlocks the Nightmares mode where you rehash certain campaign levels with zombies in them instead of your soldier & robot enemies. Playing the first iteration was interesting since it meshes a lot of stuff of your typical zombies with a new somewhat-altered storyline.  But it isn’t amazing because it’s all retreaded story missions with a voice-over narrative that tries to fit what’s already there making it feel like a hashed together plan rather than a uniquely-crafted bonus feature.  As for the multiplayer it's a mixed bag.  Treyarch largely keeps everything you've seen in previous Call of Duty titles but the new opportunities for movement get left by the wayside too often.  I wanted a mixed Titanfall experience with the honed MP build of Call of Duty.  You get much more of the later than the former.  The new Specialist classes are a nice addition to the mix but once you get outside of your thrusters and specialist abilities it's just CoD as usual.  Not one map feels like the fun playground you'd get on Titanfall where the mindset of "if you see it you can play on/with it" makes for a very changing battleground that keeps your head on a swivel better than any other shooter thus-far.  Add the terrible decision of using hybrid servers (part dedicated/part player hosted) and a complete meltdown in terms of online sustainability - something that is frustrating a majority of gamers out of the gate with BO3 and my playtime of Black Ops 3 feels stymied.  DLC is $50 for a seasons pass $15 per installment (4 DLC packs total).  You’re getting the usual 4 maps & a zombie expansion.  The problem is that games like Halo 5 are offering DLC for free and Destiny figured out how $40 can fund an entire year’s worth of DLC including the first major expansion (The Taken King) and using micro transactions that are not required to fund the extra nuances of the game.  This makes Black Ops 3 DLC look insignificant and scam’ish.  –SUMMARY-- Black Ops 3 is another mind-bending tale that requires all of your attention to figure out the storyline.  The attention to detail is almost consistent across the game’s 11 missions but a faulty starting left me wanting a bit more.  Once I got to the multiplayer I again found myself with a desire for more.  Call of Duty isn’t busting out of its shell that is really starting to hold it back but the cracks in the hull suggest Activision is considering the possibility of pushing the limits.  I can’t recommend the title but I won’t deter anyone from it either.  I just wish there was more of a playground feel to it all – that would make it a lot more fun.  Of course if you want the worst news of all: Ghosts 2 is supposed to be up next for CoD.  Ghosts was an abomination of a game and nobody is looking forward to that polished turd of a game.,9,After the let down advanced warfare was once I saw black ops 3 and played the beta it felt like a breath of fresh air.

Wrapping up MP you have amazing weapons and cool new maps that take advantages of the new movement.  Campaign is ok. Great missions but short. Zombies are probably the best thing. Shadows of evil is a incredible map lots of variety good characters and awesome guns and perks. Sprinkle in a few features like paintshop gunsmith and free run and you have an overall enjoyable Call of Duty just try it out before trashing it.,7,Very good game. I could give it a 85 but the multiplayer connection is terribly bad here in Brazil. All brazilian players are having lag every 3 seconds! It´s impossible to play!

If they fix it soon I can give it a better grade!,8,Black ops 3 is miles better then advanced warfare multilayer is funI don't no why it's getting bad user reviews it's a good gamemaps are good a lot of varietyall the people giving it a bad review must be bad at the game,0,I have never been more disgusted with a game in my life this game is a total cash grab its full of micro transactions and it lags its terrible worst COD ever.,0,Buying a $60 game where the main selling point is actually the multiplayer  mode and the connection just lags on and on making the game unplayable!

The Campaign is the worst campaign in Call of Duty history and literally makes no sense. The Multiplayer has the exact same problems as previous titles with bad hit detection terrible map design and broken camera angles.

The little 12 year old f a g g o t that likes to talk s h i t over his mlg headset and give you all of the details about how he shoved his huge c o c k in your moms vag the guy that plays f u c king fetty wap through the mic people like me who suck at the game and doesn't really give a **** the stereotypical black guy who screams the n word or f u c k every time he dies and last but not least the little Mexican kid who's family is having dinner behind him. This game isn't worth any ones time and if you want to keep all your brain cells stay away from cod and everything related. This is game is the equivalent of having a heart attack then being brought back to live but then only for your worst enemy to come and shoot you in the head.,4,This has to be one of the worst Call of Duties ever. Don't bother purchasing this game sad to see the Call of Duty franchise die but it is what it is. Poor game.,6,By no means a bad game. The campaign is a bit of a mixed bag. There's some good missions and some interesting story ideas but it's all sandwiched between some of the most boring gameplay in any CoD campaign. The Multiplayer is solid as always and a lot of fun being what i can only describe as "Advanced Warfare meets Black Ops 2 meets a bag of crack".

Oh and now you have special powers to mess around with. Some are good and some not so much but none of them have stuck out as very overpowered or very underwhelming. Shadows of Evil is just okay. It's not as bad as tranzit but it's a far cry from most zombies maps prior to it. I have yet to play Nightmares Dead Ops Arcade 2 or the Free Running mode.,4,Glitchy game that has trippy weird mirror-like spots on the screen where the object painting doesn't render right. Parkour-ish features are clunky and gimmicky. Not the quality expected from a premium game.,6,Looks great. Customization is great very deep. Best yet and hopefully something that sticks going forward. But man I have to say as much as I can stress it this futuristic direction of the game sucks hard. If I wanted to play Halo I'd play Halo.

Hell I'd rather go back to the WWII than this silliness.,8,For sheer bang for your buck Call of Duty has always delivered and Black Ops 3 does this in spades with a plethora of content that equates to three games in one.

For this alone it deserves high praise. My main gripe with it (once again) is with its campaign. Yes things are different however it is as linear and predictable as its previous brothers and sisters leaving me craving a shooter with a well driven story. The rest however is absolutely amazing polished clever and will keep your thumbs numb long after your Xmas turkey hangover has set in. For myself the return of Zombies alone is worth the fee as it is easily the best installation of the Treyarch adaptation and was the very first thing I played. As for multiplayer.. Well you know the drill.. If you can stomach the filthy 16 year old racial slurs it is as expected. Sheer shooter brilliance. I would have scored this a 9 or 10 if the campaign wasn't so cartoon-esque and predictable but as a package this game is a no-brainer. Well done Treyarch you have once again infuriated girlfriends around the world.,0,Hands down the worst COD game in the series the campaign is full of crap it really made me sick i couldnt even finish the game it was beyoooond garbage like one of the worst games i've ever played  the online mode is also full of **** i dont know why they dont stop this annoying series they release a new game like every year  please stop this mess and stop wasting people's time and money,0,if you're still buying into this franchise after numerous titles the past 6 years then youll love the stale taste of the game mechanics. the best thing i can say about this game is that its at least treyarch but the thing that needs to come back is the extensive gore from world at war. limbs falling off and sorts,1,Activision Killed COD afer firing Respawn Studio  i cant imagine how this franchise would be now if Activision stayed away from the dev teams  ...  i give it 1 for the name   . RIP COD 4,6,It's ok but probably my last buy in the franchise. The inspired moments that made Modern Warfare and Black Ops I so good are long gone and in lieu of programming better AI Activision seems to just throw three times as many baddies at you and leave them just as dumb as ever. For all the graphical improvements the graphics on your cybernetic powers are glaringly bad. This really feelsIt's ok but probably my last buy in the franchise. The inspired moments that made Modern Warfare and Black Ops I so good are long gone and in lieu of programming better AI Activision seems to just throw three times as many baddies at you and leave them just as dumb as ever. For all the graphical improvements the graphics on your cybernetic powers are glaringly bad. This really feels like the bare bones of CoD like a very generic FPS. The sequences have gone completely over the top to the point that they're now completely stale. There's no volume control every sequence is you against fifty guys with drones flying in and total chaos. You're supposed to be breaking out of a rebel prison and a terrorist safehouse yet both are stocked with over a hundred soldiers and fifty robots. Like Ghosts the storyline is kind of empty at least so far and the main character's voice acting is terribad. The multiplayer is lacking in depth. The timed power ups aren't terribly well implemented and the pvp just doesn't feel like realistic CoD shootouts. It feels like a knock-off of Titanfall complete with wall running.,0,There is skill based matchmaking that is very bad. Do not buy this game because there is skill based matchmade which means you will have to sweat alot.,0,I hated this campaign. It made no sense at all and I found myself so annoyed at the story at the halfway point I wanted to cry and chuck a fit but instead I sucked it up and tried to care about the characters at which I failed to do. A total waste of time and effort. (Multiplayer is decent.),0,the wors cod of ever that    sucks    treyarch arruinated this game so lets go play star wars ewe xdxdxdxdxthe wors cod of ever that    sucks    treyarch arruinated this game so lets go play star wars ewe xdxdxdxdx,3,Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah...

The flinch mechanic promotes you shooting 1st WAY too much you can't fight back in gunfights the high ROF weapons just do WAY too much damage and shotguns... don't even get me started. Also the movement... sucks. Ok it sucks. Clunky compared to Titanfall. Overall this game is nothing short but crap.,0,Cashgrab casino pay2win game. That's all. This is no fps. It's a scam for 12 year olds and manchilds. Also worst netcode to have ever disgraced an online game without excluding Bf4. Plus the campaign is terrible.,5,I know there are a lot of haters but in my option I think the game is quite well done the campaign is the same as every single fps campaign except in the future which adds something new to the franchise I think the multiplayer  is fun and enjoyable. The only bad thing is YOU GET KILLED SO **** EASILY!!,1,So in this version you can light people on fire. With your mind.  THE SHARK HAS BEEN JUMPED.

More like "Call of Dukee". Activision didn't have a vision on this one for sure. If anything I would buy this just to get my money back after I returned it.,0,Aspect ratio all wrong in wide screen resolutions (wider than 1080P).  How does this even happen in 2015?I feel like a sucker for buying this game.  I also find it hard to believe that none of the many reviewers used a wide screen setup and failed to notice that everthing thing was much wider than it should be.,0,I can't believe they thought they could call this black ops 3 rather than advanced warfare 2. The game has nothing in common with the first two black ops games other than the unimaginative killstreaks that are essentially just re-skinned versions of the same old killstreaks from black ops 2.The LAG/LAG comp/Latency renders the multiplayer essentially unplayable and the campaign is dull.I can't believe they thought they could call this black ops 3 rather than advanced warfare 2.

I bought this steaming pile of crap and finally learned my lesson - COD's dead and isn't coming back. I will not play the next call of duty game.,0,This game shouldn't have anything to deal with the future. That's for "Advanced Warfare" where everything is Advanced. Black ops 3 should be a "Simple & Solid" game more similar towards Black ops 2 and 1 Not all the futuristic stuff that's not even part of the Black ops series...,7,I gave this game a rating of 7 for a few reasons. First im going to to state all the Negative and follow up with the Positive. Gameplay - From what i can tell about Blops 3s movement is its pretty much just a filtered version of destiny titanfall and advanced warfare. Though it does feel more ground based than the previous titles. Which is a good thing. Now as far as the guns go..WellI gave this game a rating of 7 for a few reasons. First im going to to state all the Negative and follow up with the Positive. Gameplay - From what i can tell about Blops 3s movement is its pretty much just a filtered version of destiny titanfall and advanced warfare. Though it does feel more ground based than the previous titles. Which is a good thing. Now as far as the guns go..Well this is where i see how it feels so consistent or similar to blops 2 which is also good and bad but not too refreshing. the pick 10 works but also falls short when you realize the new additions for example how many attachments you can put on your primary weapon now leading to usually no side arm if you need one or no wildcards cause you wanted a beefier primary weapon.Those are my personal problems on Gameplay on multiplayer now to the actual features. Campaign - I cant give a full review on this because i haven't played it but the fact that Treyarch incorporated co-op was a bold move especially the ability to level up your abilities. Very smart! MULTIPLAYER - The specialist addition is nice i suppose but feels a little biased towards certain specialist and the fact that your specialist weapon cant be temporarily halted or swapped out is a bummer. not to mention the fact that if you activate the weapon or ability and happen to die the second you do results in an instant loss of it. The Maps - to be quite honest the majority of the maps dont really feel well thought through or exciting like Black ops 2 did maybe its just me but i hardly favor any of these maps. Customization - This is the area where Blops 3 really gets it right. The ability to make your own paint job as well as add a camo to your weapon. Gunsmith is also a nice addition but is limited to the weapons and attachments you've unlocked. You can also Customize your specialist if you favor a certain one more you unlock more helments or heads and also what they wear even to the point of taunts and victory quotes. Felt like the clothes and helments could have had more of a variety but nonetheless its good. ZOMBIES -  Now i dont know if its just me but Shadows of Evil feels like a really difficult map there's so much to do and unlock in so little time because the zombies become potentially difficult very quick.unlike Blops 2 zombies i found myself dying at really early rounds. I really like the Atmosphere of the stage just wish i could explore it more without being mauled down by Zombies so quick.Most of my friends and myself prefer (blops one and two) zombies so far... I haven't had the chance to play (The Giant) map because i havent bought the Season PassBut i am sure it has to be better difficulty-wise than Shadows of Evil. SOUND - The gun shot sounds don't sound as nice as previous call of duty titles for some apparent reason but explosions are nice and how specialist refer to each other by their names. Zombie screeches are kinda the same old but the new voice actors for the characters are pretty well done.Thats pretty much all i can say on that. Overall its a good take on the Call of Duty series and a really good fps shooter with capturing unlockables and progression. Lets hope to better future maps for zombies and multiplayer as well.,0,ПОЕЗД СДЕЛАЛА БУМ ИЛИ (or)  GAME OF THE YEAR . Pooooooooooooooooooor graphics in  2015 !

Although a fun campaign to complete with friends it was boring and silly. The only fun I had in that was with my friends cracking jokes at how awful it was! Zombies is a masterpiece!

It take 10 mins just to join a lobby and then it lags. Btw my internet is fine! If this game was just zombies it would get a 8 or 9 however it has a dodgy multiplayer and confusing campaign alongside it!,0,It's Call of Duty.... what more can I say. The only reason it gets a one is that the physical copy does smell good when tossed in a fire :) Overall same crap that is just repetitive garbage. Go back to World War 2 or some other historical war and I might actually enjoy it!,0,The lag is real folks!  I bought this game to play online and i must say it is just unplayable.

When I pre-ordered black ops 3 i hoped it would be the first good COD since bo2 but no was equally as bad as advanced warfare.

The maps are reasonable but appear flat compared to the brilliant COD AW. Finding full lobbies is difficult sometimes and I've played games with only 6 players I am not surprised that many COD fans are back playing Multiplayer COD AW where full lobbies are always to be found. Unfortunately I coughed up for the map upgrades before playing unlike previous COD's you cannot go to a specific lobby for the new maps and consequently have to wait game after game to play the new maps you paid good money for. I hate to think that this is the last COD title I will be buying but if the series continues like this it will be bye bye from me.,2,Black Ops 3... What a train wreck.

To start out with the good;-The movement system is extremely crisp and almost always perfectly responsive-Most of the maps range from decent to good with a  few exceptions.-The graphics while not pushing the PS4 or X Box One's limitations aren't as bad as NBA 2K/Live 16.There however is a lot of bad to outweigh the good;-The netcode and hit detection is not only inconsistent but they are bad at BEST.-The game has gone pay to win in a $60 ($100 if you buy bundled with season pass) with a double barrel sniper that has only one downside when compared with the one that isn't random chance to get being that it doesn't take an actual scope. Along with the fact that Treyarch is nerfing (reducing in power) all of the non-random chance weapons while buffing (increasing in power) the ones that you basically have to pay between $50 and $200 for.-Treyarch does not know how to balance a video game they buff things that don't need to be buffed and nerf things that ruin the variety of the game not often enough and too little.Overall I put this at the absolute bottom of any Call of Duty that has come out since CoD4 and I can wholeheartedly say that as a person who own and has prestiged at least once in every single CoD since 4 excluding MW3. Let's hope that Infinite Warfare can save this series.,2,black ops 3 is 2015's call of duty cash cow. it is a below average game filled to the brim with mechanics that take skill out of the equation such as lag extensive aim assist and stupidly fast ttk. it is a video from a legendary franchise that is aimed towards children which isn't a bad thing but when the goal is to sell those children supply drops this is actually illegal. supplyblack ops 3 is 2015's call of duty cash cow. it is a below average game filled to the brim with mechanics that take skill out of the equation such as lag extensive aim assist and stupidly fast ttk. it is a video from a legendary franchise that is aimed towards children which isn't a bad thing but when the goal is to sell those children supply drops this is actually illegal. supply drops are the worst part of this game. they are filled with **** such as obstructive reticules and ****ty skins like inferno or a stupid clown camo. the camos and "taunts" in these boxes prove that the game is aimed towards kids because otherwise why would gingerbread man skin and the dab emote exist? but by far the worst part are the **** pay to win guns in the supply drops. to get a rare supply drop takes on average 10 games. a game lasts 15 minutes so one supply drop is 150 minutes of gameplay. this is absurdly long since the drop rate for weapons is 0.3 percent. out of 615 supply drop items 5 were weapons and 2 were the iron jim. on average you have to spend $81 or spend 2 and a half days game time to receive a single weapon which makes gambling a major pressure. overall - **** illegal / 10 next campaign. campaign is ok. its an above average shooter story. I would rate it as slightly worse than halo 4's but better than ghosts. the reason that the campaign doesn't redeem the game is that it is impossible to fail even if you are **** it is so damn easy. there is one section where your in a jet and you literally don't have to do anything to shoot down other jets other than pressing rt every now and then its insulting that such a legendary franchise would dumb down so much in the name of profit. campaign - easy/10 zombies is the only good part of this game but the inclusion of easter eggs massively take away from the fun of the wave defence. if you don't do the easter egg parts you die. that's it. its almost impossible get far without the easter eggs. but if you do the easter eggs you have to kite a crawler around for half an hour which literally noboby likes. its also gets increadably repetitive doing the easter egg over and over for 30 minutes every time just to have a fun wave defence game. zombies - appeals to autistic people / 10 multiplayer is not fun. it is designed spesificly to entise little kids to start playing the game by making massive noobs feel like badass by introducing lag to randomise kills. imagine it like this. if little billy a 10 year old comes up against Segway steve a 20 year old badass in a game of basket ball first to 10 points steve will get 8 points and billy only 4 but if we introduce a coin flip when they score (the coin flip symbolising lag in cod) on average billy will score 2 but steve will score 4 therefore halfing the perceived skill gap. now statistical outliers are possible so it could be that all 4 of billy's points are legit but only 3 of steve's are so then in that situation billy just won a game against a total badass and is now hooked on basketball. replace cod with basketball and points with kills and the coin flip with lag and this analogy works with call of duty. multiplayer - 6th grade / 10,0,Absolutely shockingly terrible. Will they ever stop making the same garbage again and again? At least halo I'd trying something new. I suggest you buy halo 5 for multiplayer this time folks . This is atrocious.,10,I created an account for the first time just because of this game.  I feel it is my duty as a gamer to communicate to everyone what a masterpiece this game is for PS4.

It has smooth fluidity and the guns are a pure psychotic pleasure.  I can hardly wait to level up through the progession to see what exotic fruit is in the higher branches,10,great game! i loved call of duty advanced warfare aswell but for those who miss the old "No parkour exo robot high tech **** i wouldnt recommend it but i love how the movement fits so good with the multiplayer feels like a combination of dirty bomb and destiny which i think is great. 10/10,9,FPS issue already fixed... dont listen to the whiners. Game is the first Ive played since the original black ops and it was a ton of fun! Great game! Zombies is incredible everything is new and refreshing but similar enough to hop right into. Seriously dont listen to the hate brigade the game is fine!,8,Great game just needs some tweaks. Don't believe any of the people giving it a 1 or 0. Multiplayer and Zombies are great the campaign is fine. Just needs tweaks in spawns and team making (as usual).,8,Black Ops 3 enhances the Call of Duty style of gameplay by innovating new mechanics into their gameplay. Call of Duty has two major platforms that people generally purchase the game for.

Call of Duty has two major platforms that people generally purchase the game for. The Multiplayer and Zombies. I have always enjoyed the zombie maps but they become redundant if you are trying to solo them. They are best played online. The whole "Swing" era of zombies is a nice touch on the Nazi Zombies but I am finding it a lot more difficult and confusing then previous games. Before you had one objective and that was to try to survive as many rounds as possible. I find that there are a lot of new obstacles to learn which takes a bit of the fun out of this. I think they should have decreased the difficulty a little bit. Otherwise its still a lot of fun with friends. The music is fantastic and the graphics are very impressive (especially going beast mode). Multiplayer:Multiplayer is multiplayer. I am not a huge fan of the maps. I find a lot of them very similar. I do like the fact that there are hardly any camping spots but the maps leave something to be desired. The guns feel somewhat balanced at the moment but that is subject to change until someone finds one to abuse. That can be fixed with patches at least. There arent as many scorestreaks being used which is nice. There are no longer 6 UAVS and 3 choppers at once in a map so surviveability is up. Jumping:Seems like they improved the jumping from Advanced Warfare (which I thought was atrocious). The running on walls is a nice touch Specials:Still need to be balanced. I prefer using the abilities rather than specials but the abilities are terrible in comparison. Campaign:Love that they added co-op. makes it a bit more enjoyable. I have always preferred Treyarchs campaign over Activision. If you are going to buy this just to play the campaign: Don't do itIf you are buying this to play with friends: Purchase itIf you are competitive: Purchase it,10,in my opinion the game doesn't stutter at all with everything on my console being up to date. The new multiplayer manages to keep my interest and I like the new specialised levelling up system. This is the best call of duty since mw3 and it shows that the franchise isn't dying yet :P,10,this game is awesome. i don't understand why COD haters gave this awful score is 0 or 1. what the hell wrong with them ? graphic look great.. campigan mode is fun to play.. great job Treyarch,9,Solid multiplayer! Story is long enough but not good enough. Cooperation is fun! Most importantly there are zombies and nightmare mode as well as the free run mode. There's a lot of interesting content in BO3 which are pretty impressive. It's $60 well spent. However if you just want something creative or something new in the campaign skip it.,8,Been a COD player since World at War (2008). The multiplayer and zombies are great and it seems like they slowed the pace down since the previous COD games. The jumping can get annoying but it's not as bad as COD AW and easy to pick people out of the air. The Zombies mode is the BEST PART and worth buying the game just for zombies.

The special abilities are fun and don't ruin the game because you need to build up a power bar to use them (like in Destiny). I gave it an 8/10 because the only thing I don't like is that there aren't many secondary weapons to choose from.. how hard is it to add a couple extra pistols or rocket launchers?,10,Black Ops 3 IS a masterpiece it's the most complete game if we talk about content. The campaign is perfect it has what has been missing in old Cod plus you can play co-op with your friends something different that we never had before multiplayer is just amazing it feels so good smooth and IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AW it's so rewarding when you level up and it makes you want to play moreBlack Ops 3 IS a masterpiece it's the most complete game if we talk about content.

THANKS TREYARCH,1,This game is awful in graphics and the other technic apparts and story mode is really bad another American soldiers that kill everyone .

The campaign is laughably bad !! The multi-player maps are uninspired. On top of that there are tons of glitches. Quit buying this and play some better games.,10,last Call of duty I owned was 2008 world at wars a jump from that to this blew my mind. So many customization options Love it. I look forward to the rest of November games!,6,THis has to be my favorite call of duty since MW2.  Although the 'wall run' is not a new concept it feels so amazing the way it's been implemented into this cod.  The maps on multi are by far the best in years if not ever. So well thought out and works perfectly with all the abilities.  Don't listen to the negative reviews from halo fan boys.

The campaign is addictive .Multi good old COD. From me 10/10. Bravo Treyarch keep it up guys.,0,game for teenagers and hard fans. Nothing special all of the features were seen before. Looks like activision keeps doing nothing new because teens will buy it anyway.Not reccomended the ga is waste of time and money,0,Might just be me but has anyone else felt like call of duty hasn't been good since Black ops 2? either way this game was purchased on a drunken battlefront angry moment. This being stated I gave the game a try i think im rank 25 or something in MP. I will say only one game has made me toss my control aside in disgust and that was fight night (my fault) this time its the games fault.

So much is wrong here and its clear casual gamer are just a cash cow to these developers hey go for MLG good luck beating LoL my friends. I told myself last CoD i buy is Blops 3 for the story watched vids no ineterested now its been a good 14 years CoD but its time I say good bye to you and the mess you've become I have great memories of snapshotting with Kar98ks and Mosin Nagants banzai charging with bayonets on my Arisaka in WaW and the dogs coming in the awesomeness that was CoD4 and its great story and MP. The memories oh the memories. I will not miss them cause no matter what you do they're mine and this pile of **** will be forgotten subpar i'd give it a 7 but for a game that is a AAA title it shouldn't be a 7 you get a 1 and thats me being nice. Maybe i'm just getting to the point where a younger generation has caught up to me but **** I have better things to do than log into this game and waste my time not enjoying myself and being someone else fodder while they wait for there balls to drop. So long Call of Duty its been a love hate affair since MW2 and i wish i could take you out back and shoot you.,0,game is a joke treyarch sold out.  campaign is easily one of the worst story wise you feel no connection to any of the characters and you lose interest for them and the story quick.   its called black ops 3 but it has no connection to the last two not only that but it doesnt even feel like a COD game its not a modern military shooter you cant relate to anything in the campaign its allgame is a joke treyarch sold out.  campaign is easily one of the worst story wise you feel no connection to any of the characters and you lose interest for them and the story quick.   its called black ops 3 but it has no connection to the last two not only that but it doesnt even feel like a COD game its not a modern military shooter you cant relate to anything in the campaign its all futuristic crap it felt very close to crysis 2 MP stick to mw1 mw2 mw3 BO1 and BO2  this one continues the crap from the last 2 CODs more futuristic big complex maps and non relateable futuristic weapons.  what the hell is this specialist crap as well the character themes are a blatant rip off of destiny emo looking females with hoodies and robots thats not COD. ive been playing MP for awhile and only been seeing the same 3-4 maps and was wondering why well b/c no one was voting for the others until i got in a game with a map i haven seen it was a big multi level map and the game was slow paced and took to the limit to finished now i knew why all the matches i ve been playing took place on the same 3-4 maps aquarium fringe havac and redwood the MP sucks compared to the CODs of last gen noone asked for these changes that have been made and the changes we wanted havent been addressed like lag we dont want futuristic maps or weapons b/c we dont relate to those things and COD should be a military shooter ill go play halo or crysis or even killzone if i want futurist themes.  we dont want big ass complex maps b/c the fast pace action is gone and its difficult to spot enemies with all this **** in my line of sight. and we dont want emo looking charters or robots we want normal looking military personal activision has been killing COD for the last 3 years what was once one of the best franchise scoring high 80s and mid 90s on here year after year has now gotten to low 80s and high 70s all b/c they went to the future scify route with robots double jump laser guns and character models that are ripped off from destiny and crysis  no one wants that crap from COD we have halo and many more scify FPS out there get your **** together activision treyarch sledgehammer and infinty ward i dont want to see this crap again next year go back to the modern era or even 90s 80s and 70s,0,worst call of duty ever! graphic is bad the gameplay sucks the story is like the worst ever and the future thing they are leading this game into is ruin the game! i miss the old world war games! modern warfare where a so much better game now its the worst shooter i have ever played!,6,First off lets talk online play because that's COD's bread & butter.

Lastly there are some serious issues with signal boosting players and the servers themselves because players keep killing you from nowhere then suddenly popping onto your screen once your dead. I give this a 6 because overall it is still just above average.,2,Finally got some time to play some Black Ops 3 and boy am I glad I chose to RedBox this game. People used to complain that these shooters needed more color rather than the overused sepia and orange overtones but I don't think they meant allowing guns and armor to look like cartoons.

People used to complain that these shooters needed more color rather than the overused sepia and orange overtones but I don't think they meant allowing guns and armor to look like cartoons. As I watched people running around with hot pink camo skinned weapons and bright yellow armor with bandoleers saying "BOOM" on them (which would be more at home in Sunset Overdrive than COD) I can just shake my head at what's become of this franchise. It looks more like Splatoon than COD - especially with the newer maps from the first DLC (Splash specifically) - and that bothers the hell out of me. It's as if they've realized they might as well pander to the pre-teen set despite the M rating (and it also explains why one of the kids in the Cub Scout pack my son is in showed up with a Black Ops 3 painted Pinewood Derby car... he's SEVEN YEARS OLD). The game is the same formula as ever and twitchier than it ever has been. Campaign is a joke yet again. Zombies isn't even that solid of an offering this time around far more limited than it's ever been in previous Treyarch COD titles. If you're looking for a game where you can run around looking like an 80's/early 90's cartoon reject spamming buttons then this game is for you. If you're looking for a shooter that treats its audience like more than pre-teens look elsewhere.,0,Multiplayer is broken! Deaths happen way too fast and reward cheaters. This game is the worst ever please just remake black ops 1 and 2 and sell us an exact copy on ps4. This game is awful! Campaign mode is only thing decent!,9,It may seem stupid to give a Call of Duty game a 9 but given the amout of content (dense multiplayer great multiplayer and not one but TWO main campaings) the variety of playstyles available and how fun it is to play co-op this is easily one of the best Call of Duty games to date.

The story isn't as good as Black Ops 1 or 2 but it's still enjoyable and allows for way more costumization (and split screen!). It does its best to remain true to the core experience of COD while trying to change everything else. If you hate the series then there is nothing I can say to change your mind but if you are willing to give this game a chance you will get the most content rich COD af all time.,0,Call of Duty starts off good but ultimately fails to produce a semi-decent game. The one thing they got right was the name "Call of Duty" because this video game was produced from the bowels of the CEO of Activision.

So many glitches I could  call the game Call Of Dukey: Glitch Bugs IIIVerdict: 0/10,7,I won't go mental and give this game too low of a score as it does at least deserve to be middle of the road due to the many changes that have come along with this iteration of CoD. That being said there's a reason that there are so many negative reviews and it's not because of "haters". A lot of these people are players that know great games.If I listed great games on PS4 rightI won't go mental and give this game too low of a score as it does at least deserve to be middle of the road due to the many changes that have come along with this iteration of CoD. That being said there's a reason that there are so many negative reviews and it's not because of "haters". A lot of these people are players that know great games. If I listed great games on PS4 right now It'd be GTA Witcher 3 Bloodborne TLOU Dragonage & after that it becomes a bit more of a struggle. Call of Duty:Black Ops 3 no matter how much of a fan boy you are does not deserve to be anywhere near that upper Echelon of games. I see IGN year after year giving CoD a 9/10 rating.. We all know they pay for those reviews and IGN are not to be trusted one bit. Call of Duty is the same thing it has always been the same futuristic nonsense since the series went downhill & it's the same players buying it. One dimensional gamers that don't even know what games like Witcher 3 are! I say let the poor players keep buying it Call of Duty will remain the measuring stick by which bad gamers are judged by the gaming community it is the breeding ground for people who are terrible at games in general and need an auto aim cartoon FPS to feel great. For anyone on the fence about this game just ask yourself... Is it really worth spending $60 + the price of all the DLC packs for a game which is pretty much the same experience as every year & next year will be worthless because everyone will be wasting their money on the next version. Or would you rather use that money and wait for one of the good games coming out later? Fallout 4? Horizon Zero Dawn? Last Guardian? No Mans Sky? Those of us that know great games are not singing Black Ops 3 praises right now because it's mediocre and the fans of the series just can't see it they've got their love glasses on.,9,Best COD since BO1 ... Last COD i own was BO2 and i was disappointed in it so i dont bought the next two games. I played them only in BETA or during a free weekend on STEAM . And now? this is amazing nice gunplay; you must aim to kill not spray only nice graphic great sound good mp maps and much content :) thx treyarch for this great game ...,9,Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is easily the best CoD game in recent years. Though it may not be amazing Treyarch definitely delivers with a fun campaign mode best enjoyed with friends the multiplayer has been revamped to include 9 specialist classes who all bring something unique to the table and the zombies?

Flat out amazing with Shadows of Evil delivering the complete zombies experience with Jeff Goldblum and Ron Pearlman stealing the show. If you bought the season pass or the deluxe edition you even have access to the remastered World At War classic: The Giant. (Der Riese) But this is not all. As soon as you start the game a new mode named free-run is available for you to improve your skills with the new movement system and once you finish the campaign nightmares mode is unlocked which combines the intensity of the campaign with the world famous zombies mode and it is executed perfectly! In short campaign is fun but most enjoyable with friends the multiplayer mode will keep you coming back for more and zombies is more fun and challenging than ever! I definitely recommend this game if you're into the classic run-and-gun style that the series continues to offer.,10,when i look down i see my feet.3 is better than two.Isn't fifa isn't pes isn't watch dogs isn't metal gear solid isn't lego batman 3 isn't battelfield 4 isn't batman arkham knight isn't shadow of mordor isn't mario isn't destiny isn't halo 5 guardians isn't minecraft isn't tomb raider isn't bordelands 2,0,worst game ever. trying to copy advanced warfare slow as **** you shoot people 10 times and they dont die but you die after 2. you cant knife from the front it only stuns the person. its a **** joke. ive had every single cod game and this is the worst. i would ask for my money back but there to **** money hungry to refund it,0,Long load screens a bland campaign unbalanced multiplayer and a 44GB  download (yes I'm serious).  It's another copy and paste game and not worth your time or money.,0,It's a sad year to know that beloved treyarch is slowly losing every single hardcore fan.

Like really treyarch? Before bo3 they hadnt ripped any other games off. I have not heard anyone complain about bo1 timeline (being in the 60s) because it was realistic and it had guns everyone somewhat new. bo2 was the last straw when it comes to this futuristic **** I mean every single gun in bo3 is made up. I dont know about you but I like using the classic badass guns like the AK or UZI or SPAS-12 or my personal favourite; the M1911. Sure the graphics and texture are on point but DO NOT BE A GRAPHICS HOUND nobody likes em'. The gameplay is **** and every youtuber that says its good are being paid to say so. Every well known rating website I can guarantee that theyre being paid to say so. The only people that play this hunk of garbage are 8-12 year olds and f****** casuals. I HATE CASUAL GAMERS,2,I stopped buying the Call Of Duty after AW. This one seemed promising but it's just the same game play and nothing special to it. People who buy this game are probably noobs to the Call Of Duty world. I don't have the game but I can tell its trash.,0,Way too overrated its the same as any other call of but but with futuristic stupid tools and guns.

(by the way this the only COD that I technically bought since BO2 I didnt play Ghosts my friend gave me his advanced warfare for a week to try and convince me to play COD again no suprise it was stupidly futuristic),0,At first i began to think that Black Ops 3 would be one of the best CoD games to date. i was wrong dead wrong. there are way too many glitches that still have not been patched and to me the gameplay is just boring in general. everyone is running around and jumping all the time which is exactly the complaints i heard about 2014's Advanced Warfare. i prefer that game over this one. ifAt first i began to think that Black Ops 3 would be one of the best CoD games to date. i was wrong dead wrong. there are way too many glitches that still have not been patched and to me the gameplay is just boring in general. everyone is running around and jumping all the time which is exactly the complaints i heard about 2014's Advanced Warfare. i prefer that game over this one. if you're a fan of Call of Duty please continue to play and buy the games but i'm sorry Black Ops 3 ruined the entire thing for me. i no longer wish to play CoD games from this point.,10,I just want to say I love you stupid people that give the give game a zero when it's nowhere near a 0 it means you're just stupid and have no clue what you're talking about and you people should not be writing reviews on here that's why I have to give it a 10 to balance out you idiots that give it a 0,10,Some funny reviews on here... Great game... People moaning about bringing nothing new what do you want? It's fun and still classic cod. Halo fan boys and halo is the same as every other lol,10,Amazing multiplayer (As always) with nice and pretty solid campaign brings Black Ops 3 to the top of cybersport games. It's nice to see this gem after Ghosts and AW games,10,um ótimo jogoCall of Duty: Black Ops III cumpri-o oq ue prometeu estou jogando de  boa aqui em casa esta de parabéns estabilidade boa nos servidores ..,9,The game don't deserve a 10 in fact I would give it a 7 but as to much people gave it 0 I put a 9. A game never deserve a 0! The campaign is about ''WTF!'' I stop playing it because I was not able to find any bound with BO2 and to explain why we are so futuristic now. Even the story is hard to follow or would say to believe.

Even the story is hard to follow or would say to believe. Will probably give it a second chance in co-op with friend. Multiplayer is one of the best yet. They took back lots of thing we had in BO2 and the new movement are cool. I was fearing those but after 3-4 game I can't stop using it! The new class systeme could have been missing and it would have be a greater game but I don't hate to much either but it's like if they tried to copy destiny. Did not try other mode but I'm one of those that don't like to play zombie because it's just killing zombie will play Dead island or Dying Light if I want to do that. Graphics are better than the previous COD but I don't think that we have the best we can get on PS4. Sounds of guns are not as good as in other COD. Feel less realistic and more like an arcade game. (Well I've always said that COD is the arcade game of war-gaming and Battlefield the real simulator lol) The Multiplayer menu is missing some info or option that was cool in other COD. Like to see we are how many to play the game...be able to see the leader board of the lobby we are in...to mute other easily....etc. The game is enough good to have lots of fun and play with friends until the next game that will make us forget this game.,8,Don't let the franchise name fool you.Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a great game; nothing more nothing less.

The Zombies mode is alot of fun too even if it takes some time to get used to it. (The Beast Rituals etc.)  I especially like the new supply drop feature of having its own currency to open them as well as certain weekend periods where you can earn double experience points.  It's a solid FPS overall however it does have its shortcomings.  The campaign is best enjoyed with friends however the story itself is as boring as your typical CoD game.  Plus the new movement system isn't really all that.  I know the constant argument will be that it's just the same game just re-skinned but if you just take a step back from the hatred of the CoD franchise it's a good game and it shouldn't be written off as nothing. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 gets an 8/10.,10,Between the content of the campaign the varied multiplayer and the new visuals this game is certainly a CoD worth getting.

Even if COD are back to the WW setting there will be players who are pleased and others who dont and might still give a 0 rating to it.,10,Great game fun MP which i cant really say for other FPS like Halo(still a decent game) the hate that this series get is over the top i would like the series to go back to the world war like days in terms of campaign but this is also a fun game,10,I think everyone here must have tried the beta and should already know what the game is worth.The conclusion I draw is that none of the reviews here are players with the purchased game.

Nobody spends money in a game and say you hate the game after playing the beta.I've never played a COD in the PS4 and I say that this is a marvel of MP game and the zombies are the best that can be expected. But that I expected because like everyone I played the beta.,0,What a bad game... A deception for FPS games. I has a really bad campaign mode. The grafics are bad. The maps are quite small so graphics should be much better. The only thing with a little of quality is zombies mode... But it´s still bad.,10,This is a very enjoyable CoD game. Today I played the campaign the zombie mode and the multiplayer TDM mode and these was excellent experience. the game is simply fantastic. CoD or PS4 haters give 0 point but it's a 10/10 AAA game.,9,Finally a COD worth playing. Many people are stating that this game did not add much to the franchise. In all honesty I am happy that Black Ops 3 went more traditional. It feels like Black Ops 2. If you where a huge fan of Black Ops 2 you would know what I mean. The story was good and I love the new zombies mode. In my opinion its a must buy if you where a fan of Black Ops 2.,8,Arguably the best Call of Duty to have come out since MW2 (albeit being nowhere near as good). The multipayer is fun and the maps haven't finally turned back into well laid out maps (for the most part) with cool wall running sections tastefully laid across maps being especially fun on the map redwood.

The multipayer is fun and the maps haven't finally turned back into well laid out maps (for the most part) with cool wall running sections tastefully laid across maps being especially fun on the map redwood. The guns actually have more distinct feels and have actually become validated for different uses again. Zombies is fun buy VERY HARD. It really does require team work so solo players may become frustrated. Lots of customisation to get yourself lost in in every game mode; campaign zombies and multiplayer. This game is not like a crazy next gen game as graphics are more of the same jusy with a little more polish. Gameplay is fun though and that is what mattera most.I have not played the campaign but come on seriously guys who buys COD for the campaign nowadays anyway? MW1&2 days are over. So basically no comment on that for now.A really fun game that has executed it's vision well. I feel like fanboys are giving this game toooo much praise and every other gamer jusy wants to hate on it because COD has been **** ever since BLOPS 1 but seriously this game is pretty fun.Give it a blast and pick it up or i your mate has it go round and check it out first before getting it!,10,Better game than COD:AWTreyarch cool game!This is a great game.

I really like the tweaks they made to the movements as compared to the last game. I generally only care about the multiplayer when it comes to COD. These maps are great; very three-dimensional. Regarding all the 0 - 3 reviews; most of them clearly didn't even buy the game. Most COD's are very similar with minor tweaks to skill trees abilities maps and movements. Why would so many people spend $60 or more on a game they hate so much when they know for the most part what they are getting before even trying it. For some reason COD has become so polarizing because of it's fairly consistent formula and the reviews reflect that but I do not believe the reviews reflect the quality of the actual gameplay or player disposition...,4,Just for the campaign:Pros: Graphics is awesome.

Optimized well (95%+ usage on both my graphics cards and evenly using all 12 of my CPU threads). Excellent PC port options. SPLIT SCREEN!!!!!!!!!! Dedicated servers.

And the movement of the analog stick is nothing near advanced warfere. That game was perfect. If i set the sensitivity low then i cant turn around. If i set it higher it is stil slow but the aiming is terrible compare to AW. And the guns sounds like nails. High gunshots with no base to the sound. It is so flat. And the vibration in the controller is a joke when shooting. I want to feeeel when iam shooting. if they want it small just go with nothing at all. And the suppressor it did nothing except for hiding my shoot on the radar.,10,Goddamn this game is awesome Although this one of the perfect Call of Duty game ever!

After Black Ops 2 I switched to Battlefield because it was the more enjoyable video game. There was no true Call of Duty on the current gen console. With Black Ops 3 it feels like we finally got a Call of Duty worthy on being on next gen.Review is multiplayer based: I enjoyed playing 8 hours of Black Ops 3 more than I enjoyed dozens of hours of Advanced Warfare and Ghosts combined. After Black Ops 2 I switched to Battlefield because it was the more enjoyable video game. There was no true Call of Duty on the current gen console. With Black Ops 3 it feels like we finally got a Call of Duty worthy on being on next gen. It actually offers something new (specialists thrusters wall running paint shop). Its not the most extraordinary addition but it offers something fresh compared to previous CoDs. The map design is pretty well with each map being unique in its own way. You're not constantly trying to find people and the color schemes are very vibrant. The gun physics feel similar to that of Black Ops II which is in no means a bad thing. It feels satisfying to use Treyarch's weapons it feels satisfying to feel bullets hit targets and it feels satisfying getting the kill shot marker. As a long term Call of Duty fan who felt disgusted with Ghosts and Advanced Warfare I think it's safe to say Black Ops III makes up for the past two years. It's not the best CoD but it's better than the CoDs currently available on PS4 and Xbox One. It is a simple fun and easy to pick up arcade shooter. 9/10,10,Multiplayer Campaign and Zombies are all FUN in this game! It's a mixture of Black Ops 2 Modern Warfare 2 and Destiny all in one and it works REALLY well!!!,0,The worst Call of duty game. The difficulty is very hard even on the easiest level. The visibility is horrible during whole game you cannot see who is shooting you because in 90% of cases the opponent are the same color as environment. Still missing the old classic world war 2 scenario game. Robots and flying objects are not call of duty "must have".,0,Oh how I hate this game! 1st the specialist the fact that I'm stuck with the garbage players they created pissing me off AW character creation was better.

That being said this is first solid COD experience in the current generation IMO. Graphics are great game runs as smooth as butter and the new additions to the game play are a welcome change to a somewhat repetitive franchise.,5,Really fun game plenty of hours worth of stuff to do. The people leaving **** scores haven't played the game this sites user review system is entirely pointless by now. So many fanboy losers.

No doubt it's the people that don't even have the game but just wanna hate because it's the trend. The game isn't a 10 either more of a 8/10 but here's to hoping this 10 rating balances out the ridiculous hate this game is receiving.,10,Superb game superb graphics and gameplay it brings a lot of new creative stuff to the table.

I like them I thought it would be mental with the abilities but it's really not your special will probably affect 1 person depending on the situation and if you die while trying to use it you lose it and it doesn't come back for a while. Look at this user score 247 idiots who want the same moan it's the same whilst also moaning it's too different. Ignore them. Bottom line - If you like fun get it. If you can't afford it don't leave a poor score on metacritic to make yourself feel better. No I'm not a COD fan boy btw.

War. Guns. It's a tale as old as time. Literally. In Call of Duty: Black Ops III you play as a soldier fighting a war some 50 years into the future. While in a firefight you get yourself pretty messed up by a robot and are in need of some heavy cybernetic enhancements. This is where the campaign of Black Ops III takes off.The first thing you'll notice is how darn prettyBetrayal. War. Guns. It's a tale as old as time. Literally. In Call of Duty: Black Ops III you play as a soldier fighting a war some 50 years into the future. While in a firefight you get yourself pretty messed up by a robot and are in need of some heavy cybernetic enhancements. This is where the campaign of Black Ops III takes off. The first thing you'll notice is how darn pretty it is. Sparks fly off of walls guns are heavily detailed and refined and the characters and cutscenes move seamlessly in and out of live gameplay. Voice acting is superb and the acting is at peak COD form bringing in Hollywood talent like Christopher Meloni and Ron Perlman and coupling them with the best of the best in video game voice acting like Nolan North. Also Seattle Seahawks player Marshawn Lynch is totally in this game. The campaign clocks in anywhere from six to eight hours depending on difficulty level though difficulty isn't much more than a few more enemies that seem to be able to see you through walls cars ten feet of concrete etc. It can be awfully frustrating. But let's be honest you showed up for the multiplayer. Taking notes from the Multiplayer Battle Online Arena genre or MOBA Black Ops III introduces Specialists essentially hero characters that the player will unlock over time. When you boot up multiplayer for the first time you'll select your first hero and that's where your character base starts. There's Outrider whose equipped with a superpowered crossbow Ruin your typical cybernetic soldier Prophet specializing in energy weapons and a handful of others. With rumors that Treyarch and Activision plan to support Black Ops III with two years of content one would expect new heroes to show their faces over time. It's kind of ingenious actually and gives the game legs.The rest of what you'd expect is also here. The multiplayer suite is packed with core hardcore and bonus game types including Team Deathmatch Domination Kill Confirmed and my personal favorite Gun Game (players cycle through timed weapons and have to basically be great with every one of them.) Create-a-Class is back along with Gunsmith a studio that allows you to completely customize your weapons. Though you may want to refrain from painting anything phallic or obscene on your guns. Oh and Scorestreaks are back too rewarding players for collecting kills without dying.New to the series is Black Market a mode that uses in-game currency called 'Cryptokeys' for random supply drops. Players can purchase said drops and gain some cool weapon attachment or equipment loot. Borrowing from games like Borderlands and Destiny some of the loot may be rare though that's totally up in the air. Ten Cryptokeys net you a common supply drop and 30 will score you a rare one and yes they do seem a lot like microtransactions. The thing is you can't actually use real money to buy these though that can always change in a future update. And if campaign and multiplayer just aren't enough Black Ops III brings back the ever-lovable Zombies mode which is a blast to play with friends. There's also a new Freerun mode which is kind of like a poor-man's Mirror's Edge. You can run on walls jump and roll and act like a total badass but you can do that in multiplayer as well. Overall Black Ops III packs a lot of punch for its $60 entry fee. With tons of content planned for at least the next year and already so much stuffed into the game it's more than worth it. The campaign and multiplayer offer new exciting experiences that the last few entries have lacked.Sure the game is a far cry (heh) from the golden age of the series but it's still fun. And at the end of the day what more can we ask for from a video game? - Nicholas Friedman The Dallas Morning News,1,Multiplayer is the same old garbage that it always is campaign is boring and zombies ships with 1 map and has another locked behind a paywall. unacceptable. this series is a plague on the gaming industry. Stop supporting this series and the underhanded practices that it promotes.,8,Black Ops 3 is a great sequel to the extremely successful trilogy in the Call of Duty franchise. It's not fantastic though as there are some areas where is flops. Most notably Zombies mode. Treyarch usually makes the best Zombies in Call of Duty. Ravensoft tried to do it with aliens in Ghost and Sledgehammer tried with Advanced Warfare and it was terrible but usually Treyarch makesBlack Ops 3 is a great sequel to the extremely successful trilogy in the Call of Duty franchise. It's not fantastic though as there are some areas where is flops. Most notably Zombies mode. Treyarch usually makes the best Zombies in Call of Duty. Ravensoft tried to do it with aliens in Ghost and Sledgehammer tried with Advanced Warfare and it was terrible but usually Treyarch makes Zombies modes that people like. However this year they have failed. The characters have nothing special about them the map is filled with squids and tentacles and the Easter Egg ending is the worst.It's not just Zombies that's disappointing about this game. The campaign mode wasn't exactly entertaining either but then again that's not why people like the Black Ops games. It's the multiplayer. And that's where this game deserves and 8. The multiplayer will keep you entertained for so long with a variety of different modes that are all a lot of fun and allow you to see how terrible you are compared to some of the other players out there. Kinda like Rocket League.Overall Black Ops 3 is not as good as Black Ops 2 but it's a good sequel with a lot of exciting content. It's only worth a buy if you like these kind of games. Otherwise don't bother.,2,This game has some really cool ideas in it. Its got a class system thing where each class has a special ability that works like a killstreak that doesn't reset on death. There are some really cool different classes and playstyles that can come from this.

There are some really cool different classes and playstyles that can come from this. However the guns are all the same repeated recipe the maps are incredibly disappointing in their failure to utilize the jetpacks and wall running mechanics. Each map basically just has a couple walls on its border that you can run along to get to the other side as well as a maybe 1 or 2 good walls in the middle. Oh don't forget the random water zones they throw into some maps just to demonstrate their new capabilities. Some things about this game are cool like the perk that lets you see enemy footsteps over the past 5 seconds but then you have the glitches On the one well designed map there is a non-wall spot where they drew in a wall and just outright forgot to code it in as well. So you walk in and you can see out of it and shoot out of it and no one has any idea where you are until the killcam. Then you have the walls that aren't properly drawn in which will at some point block your fully charged frag grenade and it will kill you. Then you have the matchmaking and connectivity which outright suck. Between the constant disconnects the insane lag and the obnoxious glitching it causes it can be nearly impossible to play sometimes. One final thing is that after about an hour of playing it on the PS3 your PS3 will overheat and freeze. You will have to force it to turn off and it will need an hour to cool down. This is honestly the worst recycling of the cod series i have yet to see and it really does go to show you that Activision is completely incapable of creating anything new without screwing up absolutely everything else. You still want to buy it good luck to you and have fun waiting for 15 minutes to find a game that doesn't drop you right away.,10,I haven't played CoD since Black Ops I and I have to admit it got me really addicted after the first 10-15 hours of multiplayer.The single player is a part I don't care about and can't tell anything about it. It's the multiplayer that keeps us playing hours after hours!The jumping and jet pack make me feel like in Destiny but the wall running opens so many possibilities.Thumbs UP!,8,Best Call of Duty in years. They've finally gotten the faster mobility including wall-running and super jumping worked out to a level of buttery smoothness which helps in all areas of the game. Multiplayer isn't the twitchy mess that Advanced Warfare was and the campaign is super fresh.,10,I feel like this was a good come back for the Call of Duty franchise. Everything is basically re-newed and improved. I say it's way better than Ghosts and Advanced Warfare,9,It's COD season!!!! Treyarch has once again proven they are the best of the 3 at making COD games. This years game is amazing. Probably the best campaign since MW2. A multiplayer that is so enjoyable compared to Advanced Warfare. And yes Zombies. Zombies is great! The only reason why people have giving this game a low score is because they are COD haters who just want the attention... TheyIt's COD season!!!!

A multiplayer that is so enjoyable compared to Advanced Warfare. And yes Zombies. Zombies is great! The only reason why people have giving this game a low score is because they are COD haters who just want the attention... They should do themselves a favour and save their money every year because quite frankly your opinions are ridiculous! This is by no means a bad game not even close. So if you enjoy shooters and or a fan of COD pick this up. And Haters keep Hating!,1,Абсолютно отвратительная игра сингл слишком урезанный локализация отвратная в онлайне лаги постоянные и одна и та же карта "Combine" выпадает.

The shooting is solid and there's enough varied content to offer re-playability for a long time. Sure this game lacks in almost all supporting aspects (forgettable story soundtrack and graphics could be better) but none of that interfered with gameplay.,8,Unlike everyone else in these reviews I'm not going to compare the game to other games.

Already used wireless connection wired connection port forwarding and it's impossible to play. USD $109 to the thrash...,9,Yes campaign is terrible.I'm also not interested in Zombies. But multiplayer is pure gold.Jetpacks are well made and has no such influence as everyone might think.Everything is balanced and works properly.There is sooo much content and challanges to unlock.Also lor inside multiplayer is cool thing.,1,a total disgrace.  no campaign.  only single player for zombies.  the worst is it keeps freezing up constantly on my ps3.  activision should have known how bad it was on the ps3 and not even released this game.  maybe it plays ok on ps4 but it is total crap on ps3.  this may be the last game i ever buy it is so bad,8,No one playing COD at this point is playing it for the campaign. True the game SHOULD be judged on the content included on disc so a bad campaign should definitely be critiqued but the multiplayer quality is what should determine whether or not you purchase the game if you are one of the three people that haven't made a decision on it yet. This is easily the most well balanced andNo one playing COD at this point is playing it for the campaign. True the game SHOULD be judged on the content included on disc so a bad campaign should definitely be critiqued but the multiplayer quality is what should determine whether or not you purchase the game if you are one of the three people that haven't made a decision on it yet. This is easily the most well balanced and polished cod in terms of online multiplayer. If you liked black ops and black ops 2 you WILL like this one. The new movement takes some getting used to but it isn't something that can be abused to good effect. It's easy to kill people wall running easy to kill them in mid air while floating and easy to kill gravity spikes if you see them coming. The new movement system has not broken the game like some people thought it would. The maps are decent once you get used to them. There are at least 3 (not including nuk3town) that are actually really good. The rest range from tolerable to mediocre. None are completely awful. Each map has sections where the different weapon classes can thrive. People haven't seemed to figure that out yet though and still run around in the open with a gun that they should be "camping" with. The weapons are varied and each has it's advantages in certain situations except for the garbage shotgun that has to be in cod every year for some reason. You know the one it's the shotgun that you can never get past in gun game why is that in every installment? The big complaint was with sniping but I have had no issues with it. It still works like normal just less auto aim. Who cares just practice. Overall you are either a cod player or you aren't but if somehow you are on the fence don't let the 4.7 user score put you off it's worth a purchase and you will get plenty of hours of entertainment out of it. Multiplayer -10/10campaign - 6/10 Overall - 8/10,8,Black Ops 3 is a step in the right direction for Call of Duty its not genre redefining but what is these days.

Graphics are sharp audio is great the gameplay in general is fantastic and smooth with the new dimensions of travel such as wall running and swimming even in multiplayer allowing for multiple forms of attack and escape. Nothing feels as satisfying as wall running and gunning down the people below or leaping from underwater into the air and ambushing players and thanks to the player death mic feature hearing "muthaf***n ninja!" is common. The single player is your standard 6 hour campaign with a decent story filled with plot twist and your standard action movie stop the bad guys although with the addition of customizable character and coop this is probably the biggest improvement over previous titles. Multiplayer also added new levels of customization both to cosmetics and gameplay with the new specialist system allowing more advantages based on playstyle. Zombies feels as if its returning to its roots versus the last couple titles. I can honestly say this has been a positive experience with the franchise for myself and with all the modes allowing coop there is much more replayability.,9,the game quite deserves the attention of every FPS fan - the overall package is just way too good to ignore.

Do not forget Treyarch is going to add Custom maps and more with DLC. I believe that when people say that this is a 0/0 game they almost always compare it to the exo movements if Advance Warfare. The movements in BO3 are to maneuver around the map unlike Advance Warfare were you can dodge Attacks and perform many other "Exo Ablilites". Also the nightmare mode which was very fun and enjoyable a little lazy but enjoyable.,8,I played Ghosts to death (no pun intended) largely because I hated Advanced Warfare. This feels totally different to Advanced because the movements promote flow not the 'boing boing' of the previous game. You don't have to wall run to play this game and if you prefer you can keep your feet on the ground and play more like an old fashioned Call of Duty.

There's a lot of flexibility in play style allowed. I mostly play multiplayer and I'm glad to say so far the score streaks seem much less brutal than in the last 2 incarnations allowing balance to continue throughout the game. I like another reviewer do wish there were no one shot guns or at least only to the head requiring more skill The multiplayer levels do seem quite varied and I like most with the exception of the extremely bland Stronghold. I'm in the UK and I haven't as yet had any significant lag which makes a change.The campaign is competent but does seem a little flat. I'm only about 20% through so perhaps it will pick up. Not played Zombies yet so this review does not take this into account.It's ridiculous to give this game a 1 or even a 0. Even if you hate Call of Duty generically. Clearly some have not played the game. After all if you have hated CoD with a passion for years why would you have bought it again especially as the Beta was freely available?This game is not perfect none are but a positive step in the right direction.,8,Call of duty has long been viewed as a cash cow put out to feed between yearly instalments and then milked for all it's worth. While The COD franchise isn't exactly Half life it definitely fits a niche in the gaming community.

I'm happy to say that black ops 3 not only scratches my itch for twitchy cod shooting but also comes packed with an almost ridiculous amount of content for a cod game. Treyarch have long been my favourite COD developer ever since world at war they've been able to take a setting and twist in a very interesting fashion. while infinity ward used to be the top dogs of the COD series i feel that ever since their studio heads were sacked they have been on a downhill slide. MW 1 + 2  were fantastic games but MW3 and Ghosts were bland modern shooters with little promise. Black ops 3 proves that Treyarch still actually care about the product they're putting out. While the story campaign didn't exactly have me gushing it's competently woven together much like the jumper your granny knitted for you last christmas. The addition of cyber cores is an interesting touch adding an aspect of RPG to the familiar COD formula. The power trip in the first mission when you get access to almost all of the powers was a decent hook in getting me to use the system. Like many others I found the martial tree to be the most useful this tree is based around basically becoming chuck Norris and grants you an instant kill punch ground pound and a hard to control but super powerful charge which can wipe out groups of enemies. The other two trees were interesting based around basically becoming a fire mage and a hacker respectively  but I found them to be less useful then martial. All in all the campaign was a decent chunk of fun shooty action and cleverly embraces the old cod tradition of getting together three mates and some beer to have a good old fashion drunken time. Multiplayer is as tight as ever with the now trade mark pick ten system mixed in with some much gentler free running mechanics then last years advanced warfare where it was endlessly frustrating when your target jumped 50 feet in the air out of your reticle like a giant armed flea.The free running allows for bigger maps that don't feel as empty as previous big maps like the much dreaded Drone and turbine from Black ops 2. The addition of specialists is also a nice little tweak to the Multiplayer giving you the ability to pick a character before the game that has either a special power or weapon that are on a countdown timer much like the titans from Titanfall. Most importantly you can still get your 3 drunken buddies and split screen it up unlike in Halo 5. It's the time all black ops fans have been waiting for ZOMBIES! The classic Treyarch mode is back and just as good as its ever been. My initial disappointment at only having one map available (if you didn't pre-order) was quite great The new map is excellent but i'm really feeling the absence of the smaller maps like Black ops 2's Town. The new map is Shadows of evil a 1920's style dystopian history with 4 new characters stuck in a glitzy vegas style city that screams of Bioshock. I feel that this sort of ridiculous over the top setting is perfect for zombies and the banter between characters is as good as the days of Kino der Toten. The addition of Gumballs (which give short bonuses and act as a supplement to existing perks) is a nice touch. The Ability to "BECOME THE BEAST" is another interesting feature basically when **** hits the fan you can run over to a special fountain like object and turn into some sort of mixture of Cthulu and a jelly fish from hell. it lasts for a short time but can rip the zombies a new one. you need top be careful though as its on a long Cool down. The difficulty has been given a steroid shot however. While myself and some mates who were generally alright at zombies used to be able to blast towards the 40s we very quickly discovered that we were getting our asses handed to us in the first ten rounds. All in all Black ops 3 is a proper entry into the COD franchise it ticks all the boxes for what a good COD needs   but also goes one further adding small but noticeable innovations and tweaks to the standard formula to really make the game shine. I'd give BO3 a higher score but the multiplayers not running totally smooth just yet and the game costs an arm and a leg here in crickey stone the crows meat pies Australia. 100 dollars AUS or 70 bucks US.,8,Why so much hate?

However it's not always recommendable to double-jump in the air you'll get killed quickly. Tempo feels pretty fast but you'll get used to it. Jumping from Battlefield to CoD is so different! Before negation try this out! I would score this 10/10 just because haters but in reality this is 8.5/10 game.,8,I liked it.  The Multiplayer is the best its been since MW3 (The only interesting part from that game) and the Campaign is fun. The story isn't as compelling as the first but at least doesn't have an omnipotent magic drug dealer with armies of nations at his beck and call like 2 did.  Overall a good game.,8,Really people??? Ones and zeroes? You realize that reviews that like that have no validity right?

If you are tired of the formula then stop buying the game but dont give it a low score when you know it does not deserve that. Scores like that are for terrible games come on lets be realistic. Multiplayer - 9/10. Its fun fast paced has balanced weapons and the new specialist classes are a nice change of pace. With amazing graphics 60 frames per second and balanced gameplay Treyarch once again delivers a fun call of duty multiplayer experience. With a few new additions but nothing game changing its good old call of duty (way better than the last two games). Campaign - 7/10. Co op and extremely detailed customization makes the story mode a lot of fun. There are now different approaches to play style with the 3 variety of power classes and the custom weapon classes option. The story lacks any good pace suspense or character development which is a surprise for treyarch who has recently provided a great story with their last two installments. But we finally have co op! Is Black ops 3 game changing? No its not. But treyarch has taken over as the go to call of duty developers. This is the best multiplayer since black ops 2 (which was amazing) and even though the story is nothing to be desired co op is a welcome add in and zombies always delivers. THIS IS A REAL REVIEW. INSULTING THE DEVELOPERS FOR NOT MAKING HUGE GAME CHANGING IDEAS AND GIVING THE GAME A ZERO IS NOT. IF YOU DONT LIKE THE CALL OF DUTY FORMULA STOP BUYING IT EVERY YEAR.,4,The game could be a lot better if it weren't for the lag compensation.  I feel like they lied to us when they said that matchmaking would prioritize connections and that the lag comp will be better than it has been in the past.  But it's the same.

Everything else about the game can be great but it won't matter when the multiplayer sucks because you are at a disadvantage for having a quality internet connection.  When I play the game I get melted instantly by anyone yet I have to shoot people several times to get a kill.  When I played the beta everything felt so much better with the multiplayer but now it's just a miserable experience. The game has potential if they can tweak the lag comp then it could end up being a great game.  But I do feel betrayed seeing how much different the beta was and release.  I also find it frustrating that this lag comp is still here years later even though everyone hates it.  If they don't improve upon this fast it will definitely be the last COD I ever buy.  I sure won't be buying any map packs if they don't improve on it too. I would avoid this game right now and wait and see if they improve this one aspect of the game that ruins the entire experience. If it weren't for the lag comp I would have given this game an 8 probably.,7,The game is ok....but it looks like this franchise wants to keep the fans that loved this franchise in the first place.

The multiplayer has set a new standard for the game with a brilliantly paced movement system that creates and atmosphere of general gameplay and fairness. The specialists are well balanced and useful. The reason this review supports only a 9 is because of the belly-aching let-down of Zombies. The much anticipated Zombies storyline continues but this time with very difficult environments and tougher enemies making a solo experience impossible to enjoy. The Giant bonus map was also a big let-down as it had changed to much and was all the more difficult to enjoy wiping away my nostalgia. Perhaps adjustments can be made to respect this new zombies experience but until I can this review will remain at 9/10. Great camping and multiplayer truly a game for all FPS fans.,9,This installment has copped too much illegitimate hate.

Rather than clinging on to some nostalgic feeling from games past and blindly joining the CoD hate train circlejerk that has become so popular why don't you form an educated opinion for yourself? There are some issues with the online servers and people being kick from solo games when they are disconnected from the server and also some issues with overpowered weapons but these aren't game ruining and i trust can and will be fixed. This is the first CoD I have bought since Black Ops 2 (Which I didn't enjoy very much) and in my opinion it is one of the best in the series.,4,Ok. so its call of duty.There have been some new additions to the online multiplayer that I do find refreshing and nice.

The new zombies offers a lot of new mechanics that are both fresh and welcomed. Now the campaign is just plain bad in fact at some points laughable. It out right corny. I played through the whole campaign and found no enjoyment I it. Overall where it does add some new fresh mechanics most of them have been done before in other games. That's  I have rated it a 4 out of ten. If I could rate zombies alone I would give it an 8 out of ten. Hope this helps.,1,Mediocre game at best. COD has been the same stuff for years now.- Boring campaign- Horrible multiplayerZombies is great but not enough to make this game good.,10,Despite the bandwagon mentality this game is stellar and is not stale like last years Advanced Warfare. The Biggest in the series and in my opinion one the best. Black Ops 3 is essentially 3 games in 1 topped of with a futuristic flair that surpasses the likes of Crysis and Titanfall,2,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        The game just destroyed the name Black Ops for the Call of Duty series. All it is is just Advanced Warfare under a new name. Don't get me wrong if you like flying and sliding around then yeah the game is for you. To me i hate it. I'm one of those guys who gets the thrill out of going out and using my blade and tomahawk that's all really. Both Black ops 1&2 had the stick and stones mode where i could just do that but for some reason that doesn't exist on black ops 3 now. Knifing is exceptionally hard to do in the game let alone going around tomahawking. The weapons will kill you instantly within 2-5 shots which at least in black ops 1&2 you had some time to react. The 6th sense perk is just down right retarded since its just basically a constant UAV which honestly i don't know why they even have a UAV in the game since 6th sense just points you in the right direction just about every time...The spawning in the game is horrible well if you play free for all that is don't really know know much about any of the other matches in the game but as far as free for all where ever you spawn spawns another player just 20 yards away from you if not spawns you next to a player on the map for a free kill or another death....On another note camping has earned itself to a new level of stupidity as now when you play free for all some players if not all will just camp a very likely spawn point or corner to win the game very easily and they can very well get away with it since the weapons are all basically overpowered. Hardcore mode is exactly what it sounds like but with the weapons overpowered everything in the arsenal is a one hit kill. Might as well call it one in the chamber on steroids. That's on the multiplayer side now....Zombies...awesome the one thing that the Black ops series has to offer. This time around yeah they made it a lot harder to do but with such a story line to go along with it and some obstacles and missions that you have to overcome to get out or unlock the pack a punch its worth it. The only thing i don't like is that i usually like to play with my little brother in zombies and when you only play with 2 you can't pick up the tools you need without 4 people in the game. i don't know if that's just a bug or what but thats really the only issue about it. The story is decent in my opinion not to bad. As far as everything else. graphics are great and black ops 3 is just another call of duty game that will always sell for awaiting gamers in the gaming world. Yeah it would seem that all I am doing is venting about how much i despise black ops 3 but hey thats what were all doing here for right?,9,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        I´ve been a cod player since the first Cod for ps2  (before big red one) and I really like cod games for their difficult MP's the sensation that I can change the curse of every game and the very well made campaigns (somewhat difficult to understand but they always bring something exciting to the games). The only cod I didn't like was Ghost. It was good an amazing campaign fun horde mode but a big misstep for MP due to the big maps. I also played BF3 and BF4 as a big fan of FPS but then I realized everything that EA touches turns into crap. I lost faith in FPS I didn't get advanced warfare as well. Let me tell you BO3 recovered my hopes. Campaign: 8.5.  Campaign is very well written (although not as much as BO1). The story itself I very mature hard to understand sometimes predictable but interesting enough to keep you playing (something other FPS's just cant accomplish). The mechanics in campaign are fun thanks to ciber abilities. I must say it is the weakest campaign of the past 3 games in terms of infiltration missions big size battles and overall the great action-based sections of other cod campaigns but the possibility of 4 player coop personalization and the fact it is designed for 4 players (not forced as cod 5) makes it very enjoyable. Multiplayer: 10. A BLAST. It is hard to explain the potential of very skilled plays. The thrust jump is very controllable running walls is intuitive even the little smash while prompted become useful since in all these actions you keep control over your actions and your gun. The progression system the new perks variety the pick 10 system the combo perks (for even more flexibility in the class creation) the specialist itself the well rounded pack of weapons BO3 offers; there is just A LOT of content to fit your playstyle and even to redefine it. Shotguns feel great and powerful snipers one shot-kill you there's no way you cant find that one combination that makes you feel very comfortable and gives you a lot of fun while not sacrificing "power" to still in the top 3 of every match. Specialists only add even more content to personalize your class and their special abilities really makes a big difference in the outcomes of battles. Also the score design is more objective focused than ever; the times I successfully accomplish objectives without dying is were my scorestreaks breaks the limits. Zombies: 8. As a huge fan of zombie mode I certainly enjoyed this one as well. The new zombies map is immersive creepy interesting. Biggest content of all zombies map. The only let down is its difficulty. Specially for the ones who cant hold juggernaut because of dying every round you will keep trying get past round 10. Because of this I find myself often playing the Giant (the remake of der Riese). Overall: Graphics are great sounds are stunning every gun feels just right steps sound awesome (if you get wet the sound of steps also change) there are very few minor bugs. IA is good. Enemies react to your tactics they "know" when to advance or to retreat. Your companions help you much more than any other FPS I've play (including Halo resistance Ghost recon Medal of Honor). Technically the game finally reaches and surpass BF in so many ways (except for IA BF shines when talking about the must stupid insulting both enemies and friendly). SPOILER: something very important to mention is the new mode it unlock when completing campaign. It's called Nightmares. It basically recycles the campaign but with the addition of zombies (with mystery box and everything) super enjoyable even more than actual zombies. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE the huge deal this represents since game industry is decaying on lack-of-content games. They are selling us unfinished games with the pretext of completing it by buying the season pass. My first PS4 game was B4 what a let down... (very few weapons maps and modes everything copied and pasted from BF3 and I know about copy and paste im a **** cod player but this! was a hole new level of CRAP only rush could save it but past 6 months from its release no one play that mode anymore= BF4: RIP) EA is the mother of evilness in game industry. ´But I look at BO3 and I see they hided an entire new mode on an already big-content game I remember of back on those days where content became as we achieved challenges. I´ll happily buy the season pass of a great and complete game such as BO3. I even wanted to give this game a 10 but I recognize its not perfect and I would recommend it to casual players since MP and zombies are difficult as hell. Definitively a must buy for skilled FPS loversSorry for my spelling English is not my main language.,7,In short the campaign lacked. Multiplayer adds the Specialist class which gives it a good flavor. None is really overpowered and majority are found useful as you will see in lobbys that most people have a different Specialist. New Arena mode (4v4 competitive playlist) is sweet but does come with flaws. Ban/Protect makes it interesting as you 8 players can choose to Ban or Protect a gunIn short the campaign lacked.

Problem is the process takes too long as you have to wait till everyone chooses than draft a specialist create a class and edit killstreaks. It takes about 3-5 minutes to start a game after you got in it. And if a teammate leaves there is no replacing the player. Zombies is awesome as well,2,Good game... in theory.

The last call of duty game has a astonishing and amusing multiplayer..  But on the other hand the campaign isn't that good I was expecting.. Plus : black ops 3 is focusing on high tech weapons .. That what's making it too far of black ops one and it's great story..,2,Black Ops 3 while very innovative for a Call of Duty is a massive disappointment multiplayer-wise.

The fact that the game glorifies camping has a very unbalanced weapon system an unbalanced Specialist system and an unbalanced ranking system. In other words multiplayer in this game is a joke. Shotguns are extremely underrated submachine guns (as is the usual with Treyarch) are great at hip firing extremely accurate and have little-to-no recoil throwing the balance way off i.e. it would take two headshots with a shotgun to kill someone about 2 meters away and only two body shots from a submachine gun to kill someone from about 3 meters away. The fact that melee is a two-hit kill unless you use the Combat Knife is interesting but not in the style of Call of Duty and a pretty gutsy feature from Treyarch. So would I recommend Call of Duty: Black Ops 3? No honestly Call of Duty stopped being interesting after the second Black Ops game. For now just go play Fallout 4 I'm not sure why everyone isn't anyways...,10,It's the first COD I bought and well i like it.The Single/Ko-op campaign is nice (and really hard played on realistic) the zombie is nice for playing in between and for me the best part is the MP.It motivates over a long time (tons of perks for every different weapon) and it's really funny.I didn't recognize any lags or network problems.Btw.

Therefore it is with deep regret that i saw that Black Ops 3 stands among the likes of Ghosts as one of the most boring and stale Call of Duties to date. The campaign has gone from the gorgeous cinematics and memorable characters that COD is known for to emptionless romps through groups of baddies and a sea of faces who dont bring enough personality for me to even remember their names. I personally hate the nameless customized protagonist but thats the least of the issues. The 4-D movement that was advertised is absolutely atrocious. Advanced Warfare had much more fluid 4-D movement and maps that actually compliment these abilities. Your first few online matches will be spent mindlessly trying to jump over walls or wall sprint only to find that these abilities only work in specific areas making them a major hindrance. Overall i wanted to like this game i really truly did. Maybe i can one day but not today.,9,Pros:Solid and balanced MP game. Good maps. A lot of fun on it. I can't put it down. Cons:The SP campaign is bad. The characters and storyline are uninteresting. Conclusion: This is the best Call of Duty out there.,9,After 2 months of playing this i can now rightfully say this is the best Call of Duty since World at War.

It has great multiplayer with some issues but makes up for it with content. Zombies is cool but i find it insaney boring to do the exact same things over and over. Zombies has been stale since Black Ops 1. The campaign is alright though i'm getting very bored with the current time/future warfare crap. They need to go back to historical wars. The best attraction is multiplayer. It's much more well rounded though still has some issues.The left side/middle/right side map crap needs to stop as it's causing huge spawn trapping problems in this one. It's on just about every map and is just about every match.The abundance of explosives is getting ridiculous. They either need to nerf explosives or limit them much better as they're spammed sometimes to the point of making the match unplayable.Light machine guns and thermal needs to stop coming back. It's way over used and spammed. They did even out LMGs though.Aim assist/Target assist is WAY WAY too strong in this one. Obviously it's to cater to the younger crowd even though they shouldn't even be playing the 17+ game. This feature causes a lot of issues. IF you're aiming at someone and his team mate walks behind him even if it's behind a wall the aim will follow in his direction strongly.Putting players into a game that's already half finished and being very unlikely for the losing team to make a comeback is absurd. It happens constantly. Even with it's flaws this game rocks.  All these day one 0/10 reviews are bogus. They didn't experience much of the game. Give it a shot. Go to gamestop and buy it used to try it first so if you don't enjoy it you have 7 days to return it.,5,This is not a call of duty game anymore... the good CODs were MW MW2 BO and BO2.. and from all the others are not good or are just copies of other games (titanfall you there?)...The graphics are good (I think thats the only possitive point)The respawns are awfulThe story is pointless and boringThe mechanics on the game are not goodWhat the hell is the weapons on the zombies????This is not a call of duty game anymore... the good CODs were MW MW2 BO and BO2.. and from all the others are not good or are just copies of other games (titanfall you there?)...The graphics are good (I think thats the only possitive point)The respawns are awfulThe story is pointless and boringThe mechanics on the game are not goodWhat the hell is the weapons on the zombies????and overall the game is not fun to play,2,I have to say the Graphics are incredibly stunning! That's just it. The gameplay is mediocre if not a sloppy second of many better titles. For the beginning player it puts someone into an incredibly abyssmal position if they're not familiar with the control scape.

Feels nothing like AW. Most of the maps are good on multiplayer. The campaign is good too. I personally loved the zombie. I loved the game.,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Was quite looking forward to this but am quite dissapointed with the campaign its beautiful graphics but it feels flat and at times feels quite lost. The multiplayer is the same as any other COD.This feels like nothing more than a sequel to Modern Warfare 3 and Ghosts. Very difficult for my middle aged eyes to see the enemy's with this graphics. Thoroughly enjoyed Advanced Warfare but really bummed I purchased this game for $60. Luckily I didn't pay for the DLC's.This is the most fun I've had with a COD since 4 I think all of the mixed and negative reviews are unfounded and honestly Meteoritic should require some kind of proof before you can post bile or come **** on something that's "cool to hate.",8,molto bello ma è molto difficile trovare armi nei pacchetti ma per il resto è moto "facile" in confronto agli altri.i controlli sono molto semplici e si capiscono al volo,9,A savior to the Call Of Duty franchise just a bit more polishing would make it a 10 a very good job with those 3 years with 4 DLC packs to come out by the end of black ops 3's life cycle we are all in for a good time I really do feel like a got a real Call Of Duty being part of the Cod community for a long time now I feel that if the next Call Of Duty is bad we can all go back to this oneA savior to the Call Of Duty franchise just a bit more polishing would make it a 10 a very good job with those 3 years with 4 DLC packs to come out by the end of black ops 3's life cycle we are all in for a good time I really do feel like a got a real Call Of Duty being part of the Cod community for a long time now I feel that if the next Call Of Duty is bad we can all go back to this one or another one that we have enjoyed in the past,9,This game is very fun but not a lot of new things were brought to the table from previous call of duties would recommend for call of duty fans but i am getting into more realistic games.,2,I would rather pet many doggies than play this game! : )  : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : )   : ),0,Серия скатилась до самого земного ядра.....а ведь когда то я любил эту серию!......Желаю Activision жесткого провала! ибо такое даже врагу не посоветую.....,4,Wont give it a zero.

I didn't really think much of COD in general since they are now the most generic of generic FPS games but my friend brought this one over to play on my PS4 so here we are. DISCLAIMER: Multiplayer is not a factor in this review due to my long standing bias against competitive multiplayer.

I didn't really think much of COD in general since they are now the most generic of generic FPS games but my friend brought this one over to play on my PS4 so here we are. DISCLAIMER: Multiplayer is not a factor in this review due to my long standing bias against competitive multiplayer. That's right. I'm one of the three people who plays COD exclusively for the single player! So first thing I noticed about the new gen COD is that the shooting controls are so much tighter and they feel so much better. It's not even the controller either. I play the first Black Ops with a PS4 controller because the PS3 controller is garbage for shooters and Black Ops 3 just plain feels better. I'm not a super expert on shooters or anything but the controls just feel better and easier to handle. I've never been good with snipers in COD but in Black Ops 3 for some reason I'm just able to swing the scope in and hit dead on center-mass quickly and easily. Which is a good segue to the guns. The guns are all future tech stuff with sharp edges and all that stuff that looks space-age and everything. Though I laughed when I saw the future AK pattern rifle because I imagine that something like that will actually exist within the next 20 years since that thing is never going away. The guns look pretty nice but more importantly they FEEL nice. Shooting the guns just feels so much better than anything in the previous games. The sounds they make the animations when firing even the reload animations look really cool. I actually like all the guns in this game and each feels VERY different from the others instead of every single one of them just being a point at bad guy and shoot affair with no real defining characteristics save for mode of fire. The new cybernetic stuff is pretty neat even if it is just blatantly ripping off Titanfall though Advanced Warfare did it first. I like all the cyber core abilities letting me manipulate the battlefield and accommodating different playstyles. I could be a manipulator hacking enemy bots and making them fight for me or shorting out people's cybernetics and turning their own bodies against them. I could be stealthy going invisible with a silenced weapon or slamming a shockwave down on a group of enemies. Or I could just blow everything up making 5 guys puke their guts out at once and setting people on fire. It's fun to have different options in your arsenal instead of just shoot the bad guys in the face. On to the story. The story on a first run through is schizophrenic as hell and I got lost halfway through. I chalked it up to COD trying to out-COD itself as it tries to do with every iteration but by the end I was going "this is the most retarded thing I've ever seen what is even going on?". Then after the story was over I Googled "what the f*** happened in Black Ops 3's story" and read up on what actually went on. After I read up on that and understood the actual story I realized just how brilliant the story was. This is the least COD COD I have ever played. Treyarch made a fantastic story that is so complex I couldn't explain it if I used all 5000 characters I'm allowed and it's all really compelling. There's one problem I have with it though. This game's own license hurt the game more than anything. If I wasn't expecting just more COD boom bang kill everything with stupid setpieces I may have picked up on the subtle hints the game was giving throughout. And oh boy are those hints subtle. Only with new knowledge of the story was I able to catch those moments that are weaved all throughout the story. I would go "OHHHHH THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ABOUT!" to a weird moment that made absolutely no sense before. But the COD name hurts the story. If this had an entirely different license to it like a new IP and it made it's story on that uncoupled from the gigantic Michael Bay spectacle the COD series basically is now and if they tweaked the narrative a bit so it seemed more like "oh there's something deeper going on here" and less like "this is a complete clustermolest I'm so lost" then this story could've been so amazing. I really like the story in this game it's a brilliant narrative that blew my mind when I figured it out. But like I said the COD name added with the fact that it's basically impossible to not get lost bring it down. I do like this game though. It's not a bad game. Certainly not the ones and zeroes everyone and their dog seems to be giving it. It doesn't stop the series from stagnating and doesn't put the brakes on its slow descent into obsolescence but for what it is it's not bad. I just wish it wasn't a COD game. That being said Treyarch is now on my list of developers to watch because this story was absolutely brilliant even if it's flawed.,0,it **** suckedhfuvhvufhfuvhughuvgutghtugjghrfuihgriuegvhfuivfhduvifhlvfbhubgsbuigigvbyibgibgdybgibgfyigbfibgfiubhyfbgigbyifdgbifdgbfigbfkbgkyufgkfgbskbgdbgdukgbukdgbufgk,6,I have mixed reviews about this game.

It has become the same as the Modern Warfare/ Advanced Warfare titles.  But the positives are that there is something here for for everybody who likes their FPS COD-flavoured.There is Campaign or co-op Campaign there's the normal Multiplayer suite and then there is Zombies.So there's a lot of content but to get the most of it- you'll have to purchase the season pass.'Ive given the game a 7 because unlike alot of users I don't have ulterior motive.,8,I have played all of the call of duty titles since COD3 (I'm old I know). I've been waiting for a game that is somewhat playable that can possibly measure up to BLOPS 2 (which was the last title I truly enjoyed).

However there is a new "double jump ability wall-running and sliding all of which create an interesting game dynamic without ruining that "CoD" feel of the game. The "specialists" are interesting and there is lots of room for customization. The weapons sound and feel good and the maps are well rounded.  Throw in a decent campaign and zombies and you've got yourself a game that is 100% playable without DLC. Ultimately I am satisfied with this game.,10,For me its the best COD since Black Ops 1 and 2 it just gives me the same fun feeling as i used to had on the ps3. the specialist addition are fun i keep using them all the time just like wallrunning is a very fun addition to the game. its far more superior then advanced **** where you where just jumping all the time i have played that game for 3 months and just stopped playing itFor me its the best COD since Black Ops 1 and 2 it just gives me the same fun feeling as i used to had on the ps3. the specialist addition are fun i keep using them all the time just like wallrunning is a very fun addition to the game. its far more superior then advanced **** where you where just jumping all the time i have played that game for 3 months and just stopped playing it because it bored me. i'm sure that aint gonna happen with this game!,3,The time to kill is ridiculously short there are headglitching spots on every map and each gunfight is like a roll of the dice to see whose bullets fly faster. Enemies spawn both in front of you and behind you. The campaign is the worst COD campaign I have ever played. Haven't played Zombies yet but I'm sure that's the best bit of the game. Disappointed.,8,This review is going to be for multiplayer only. After playing for a long time I can gladly say Treyarch once again saved the call of duty franchise.  The jet pack and wall-running feels fresh but is not overwhelming or overpowering.

The jet pack and wall-running feels fresh but is not overwhelming or overpowering. Everything in the multiplayer is balanced and can be countered the specialists are extremely fun and also completely balanced. The guns offer good variety with each gun feeling unique and satisfying. The only reason this doesn't get a higher score from me because it's just another fps shooter in a crowded market there's really nothing here we haven't seen before and it kind of gets old fast. The more I played the more I found myself playing not for the enjoyment but for the cryptokeys ( now I know how addicting gambling is). Good game great addition to the Black Ops franchise maybe not the best of the three but definitely the most fresh. It's COD black ops with unique abilities wall running and jetpacks that's all you need to know; whether you'll like it or not is up to you.,7,I can very easily and quickly summarize the new Call of Duty. Treyarch and everything is clear. The long campaign (even two) a lot of fun in multiplayer mode and extended Zombie.,5,I only play multiplayer so keep that in mind.  I was really hoping that the wall running jumping sliding etc. would be less noticeable but it seems like AW but toned down a bit. I would LOVE for the series to go back to more modern times without the slides wall running  20 foot jumps etc. I absolutely loved Bo1 and 2 but this game has more of AW feel to it for my liking.,5,I have not played this game very long for a good reason. It was so totally uninviting and uninteresting. Felt like the same game as COD:BO2 with better graphic but in a waaay worse packaging. The loading-times when starting the zombie-mode is annoying since you have to watch a long movie and so on. I couldnt handle to spend more time when im used to a pretty slim and working franchise.I have not played this game very long for a good reason. It was so totally uninviting and uninteresting.

And the campaign is arguably better with some close friends than on your own. And more contents keeps piling onto the roster. However all that being said BO3 honestly is another shooting game. All content aside the game lays out as a basic futuristic shooter. It's a great game but not exactly enough to qualify it being worth all of your money. But at least it's not Ghosts!,0,If you smeared this game with horse **** you couldn't make it any ****ier.

All the weapons included in the base game are balanced pretty well. There are no ridiculous score-streaks that are impossible to destroy. Everything in the multiplayer is very fluid. The maps are nothing write home about. All-in-all it's simply just a good Call of Duty multiplayer. Except for Black Market drops. Every time you play a match you receive cryptokeys an in-game currency. Cryptokeys as I said before earlier can be earned by simply playing the game or you can use actual money to purchase cryptokeys. Cryptokeys Call of Duty allow you to purchase random drops filled with character win animations character camos weapon camos and guns. That's right in game guns. So instead of just unlocking the guns by playing the game you now have to spend cryptokeys either earned by playing the game A LOT or spending a lot of real money to earn guns. And it's not even the fact that they are random drops that make me angry it's that the guns that you receive are so unbalanced and overpowered that it makes the multiplayer unfair for those who don't have those weapons. With each new installment of Call of Duty I find that I dislike the game mode Zombies even more and more. Instead of going back to the simplicity and fun maps like Nacht der Untoten the first Zombies map from CoD World at War they continue to add more and more gimmicks. Why can't we have a simple survival mode that doesn't require you to build items start weird rituals and other things like that? The single-player story of Black Ops 3 is easily forgettable. I tried playing by myself but after the first couple of maps it's essentially all the same. I did play on harder difficulties with friends which was naturally a lot more fun than by myself. The new ranking system for single-player does add a new "fun" aspect to single-player but not enough to get me to come back for more.,7,Very fun co-op campaign including a Nightmare mode with zombies. Multiplayer is very fun fluid great customization tools great and detailed maps fleeing a bit of sense of futurism that the game it's proposed (this brings nostalgia for those who enjoy the old cods). And then there's a lot of content to unlock. Amazing one of the best COD ever.,8,I think COD (or any annualized franchise) is a easy target for trash talk.

The loot boxes were just awful too why should you have to pay for guns!? Why do games continue to do this!?? I'm just so disappointed by this game. Hopefully they learn hopefully,10,The amount of fun I had with friends both in multiplayer and zombies exceeds any other game I have ever played. The graphics the gameplay and the constant variety in guns maps and customization make this a fantastic COD.

A good game with a lot of content is a great game. Ignore the ridiculously low scores of supreme ignorance.,5,"Advanced Warfare is a light in the tunnel for this fading franchise." . I said this in my review for Advanced Warfare last year and oh man this franchise might as well end now. There is no more hope in CoD.  I won't go as far as to saw BO3 is godawful like so many of the butthurt haters do but it is in no way a recommendation. Star Wars Battlefront 2015 is better than this for God's"Advanced Warfare is a light in the tunnel for this fading franchise." .

I won't go as far as to saw BO3 is godawful like so many of the butthurt haters do but it is in no way a recommendation. Star Wars Battlefront 2015 is better than this for God's sake. Anyway let's get on to why BO3 is not a good game. CampaignYup. I'm actually going to talk about the campaign of this game if it can even be called that. We were promised a Terminator-like story for this game but it was completely false-advertised. Instead the plot revolves around...well I really don't know. It's all just a bunch of confusing conspiracy type **** You can just tell the developers were trying so hard to create a "smart" and "revolutionary" story here but it just falls on its face so terribly. It takes itself WAY TOO seriously too. The gameplay for the campaign is okay. There's new Bioshock-like abilities you can use in it but they all wound up feeling the same. Other than that it's just typical SHOOT EM SHOOT SHOOT EM. You can play co-op in the campaign but the matchmaking is so bad so I had to play by myself the whole time. Really in truly the only reason I trudged through campaign was for trophies. MultiplayerMultiplayer feels very...similar. All it is really is just BO2 with a new mobility system. I can't deny that I sometimes did have a lot of fun with it though. I can't really say much more about it. That's how much it feels the same. I can say one more thing though: the multiplayer is unbalanced as all hell maybe even more than any other CoD. ZombiesYou'd think that Zombies would be the saving grace for this game. Well it is not. Not in any way. It is so lacking in content with only one game mode that for the record sucks. Honestly Treyarch has ruined Zombies mode. There is now so many complicated and stupid objectives you have to complete in order to get the most out of it and have fun. I am so utterly disappointed in it. Dead Ops Arcade 2 is a whole lot of fun but it gets old quick. Nightmares mode is a creative new addition but at times it feels lazy and the endless exposition it throws at you in order to tell its story can be very boring. ConclusionBO3 feels lazy lazy lazy. It is a perfect example of why the gaming industry needs help. If your a diehard fan of CoD I can't say anything to you in terms of a recommendation 'cause you've probably already bought it. For anyone else that is one the fence though don't get this game. Please don't unless it's a rental or a very cheap price.,7,I haven't played COD for a while now I'm not a fanboy of anything and I'm no hater. This game could've been a lot better IMO but it doesn't deserve any of those stupid low scores. Campaign is good but not great with an overly complex and confusing story nothing really new nice graphics nice performance and of course the greatest thing for me is that  it's coop.

I expected a lot more of intense action though and less story telling. Fun overall but could be a lot better. Multiplayer is solid It's fast paced and handles as expected. Although I feel like the Light Machine Guns are useless because they are so slow to aim with and since in this multiplayer most of the time tis about how fast you can aim when coming face to face with an enemy. However I really prefer other games when it comes to multiplayer there are no vehicles and most of the combat is in small levels and close encounters. +Having coop campaign is the reason I got this game+Nice graphics and performance+Solid multiplayer -I found SEVERAL BUGS in the campaign really bad ones-Lacks intense action in campaign +  too much useless story telling-Gets boring quick,8,This game is a lot of fun...not the campaign I admit. Campaign : The campaign story doesn't really make sense and is just used to get to one level to the other.  It id kind of fun to play with friends but it makes the story completely useless because everybody is just talking over the cut scenes.  It is full of action but doesn't really take the COD franchise to another level.ZombieThis game is a lot of fun...not the campaign I admit. Campaign : The campaign story doesn't really make sense and is just used to get to one level to the other.

More fun with friends and you do need to cooperate to make it farther.  I think it's the most fun Zombie mode in COD. Multiplayer : Fast paced intense spectacular.  The super powers are actually fun and don't really make the game unfair for others.  The pick 10 system works great.  The wall runing is super fun the maps are smaller and make for intense battles. This is the best COD in a long while.  It is not perfect but it is immersive in multiplayer and zombie mode.  It is much much better than Ghost and advances Warfare.,7,Some of the issues have either been tweaked or maybe the connection just got better over time. But it's a lot more enjoyable to play now. I gave this game a 3 at first,10,I stopped playing call of duty after the Modern Warfare 3 campaign. I didn't even touch black ops 1 2 advanced warfare ghosts whatever else got released in the meantime. I never played the multiplayer besides MW1 (which was by far the best).

So when Black Ops 3 got announced I pretty much just ignored it - but then I saw the trailers and waited for the reviews and thought I'd grab it since fallout 4 wasn't really doing it for me. I'm really glad I grabbed this one. The campaign is absolutely fantastic and the story and the way it's told is quite fascinating and gives every singleplayer fan enough meat to chew on. Then I tried the multiplayer and it is quite fun aswell - I enjoy the speed and agility of the matches which in combination with the specialists makes for a great few hours of gameplay aswell. Overall this is the best call of duty since Modern Warfare 1 (at least to me).,1,Just terrible I bought this for a third of the price thank god but I still feel ripped off.The campaign feels like they found a crazy person on the street gave him lsd and wrote down everything he said made it into a **** rushed story and put some guns in it.

That is to say terrible. Regularly dropped in to games with about 10 seconds left not to mention the laggy servers. Gameplay has gotten way too fast paced not sure why they make it faster every year probably to make up for the lack of exhilaration and fun. They added in some useless gimmicks this year though they were fun to unlock but once I realized they were all **** and copied off of Overwatch they just got boring. Maps are pretty bad aswell apart from a few good to see they're still milking Nuketown can't wait for BO4 and nuketown 2090. Also whats with all the **** player customizations? Is the aim of the game now to look the most like a candy covered clown?Seriously they need to skip a few years and just come out with an actual game instead of a rehash of the last game every year. Maybe find out what they want to be a serious fps? Or an arcade shooter? This is neither its closer to an arcade shooter but done terribly.I hope people stop buying these so they make a decent game one day.,3,First I am a COD veteran that has played these games before they were even called COD.

I haven't played any other COD since then and I thought with redbox I can rent a game for three bucks I would give COD a chance and this game literally pained me to play. This futuristic COD with boosters and obnoxious sounds every three seconds is an abomination of what COD use to be. This game reminds me of the movie idiocracy because the game is so annoying and obnoxious with power ups and booster sounds every few seconds its like its a baby's toy trying its best to keep the consumers attention. Its sad what COD has become from the realistic WW2 shooter to the golden age of COD4 and the original black ops. COD has to get back to its roots and forget this halo jump/ titan fall crap. It seems like the generation in the upper 20s and 30s have shifted over to battlefield and COD is just for the kiddies. SMH.,8,Here is the thing I do not play COD for the Multiplayer!BUT when it comes to Campaign I was really surprised by this one. This is the best COD that has come out since COD5.

No lets be honest lazy thrown together story. Like come come are you even trying the only thing in this game that is actually worth your time is Zombies and eventually once you have mastered the maps. What is there?,7,I don't bother with the story lines or zombies just the multiplayer.  It plays ok but the different characters take some getting used to.

I just wish they'd return to some of the older outdoor maps and eras to make sniping more challenging.,6,An okay game. Multiplayer is enjoyable but not fantastic (getting really tired of futuristic/exo suit bullcrap). There are one or two instances every match where I get spawn killed.

Harder difficulties are a pain in the butt so good luck. Zombies is great as usual refreshing and new. So to summarize: Multiplayer: Same ol same ol. Fun but not great. (Tired of futuristic bull****)Campaign: Pain in the ass. Did not care for story.Zombies: As usual superb.,8,This game is a pleasant surprise.

That remains true after playing Black ops 3. Still the controls are super tight and nearly perfect; they just don't feel like your character has any weight. The specialists have really unique abilities some of which were pretty much taken right out of Destiny. There's also double jumps and wall running. It's a very fun and diverse CoD. I'm glad they can still make great Call of Duties because the last two weren't that good. The campaign is surprisingly engaging and well acted and the setting is incredibly futuristic. And of course there's zombies. You know zombies will at least put a smile on your face. It's a very complete package this game. I would most definitely recommend this to people on the fence. Probably the best CoD ever made to me. Even better than Modern Warfare 2.,5,I keep my CoD reviews simple. I've played CoD since 2005. Campaign: Treyarch can't make a campaign let's be honest it's okay. This is the first CoD campaign I never even bothered starting.Zombies: I personally liked WaW zombies the most so it really wasn't a buying point for me. I didn't like it very much.Multiplayer: This is why I buy CoD. We all thought Ghosts was the worstI keep my CoD reviews simple.

I didn't like it very much. Multiplayer: This is why I buy CoD. We all thought Ghosts was the worst CoD ever back in 2013. Then Advanced Warfare came and turned Zika into Ebola. Call of Duty became so incredibly bad with AW it made Ghosts look good. Idk how you do that. Then came Treyarch to save the day! Or so we thought. Shortly after launch as a usual CoD development procedure the guns are re-balanced every month creating instability thus ruining the experience not to mention lack of dedicated servers causing lag spikes still to this day. Even Ghosts had dedicated servers and it sucked. We all hoped BO3 would save CoD but it's just another cash grab by Activision who doesn't know what made a once great franchise so great.,5,3 Steps Back. Coming off of Advanced Warfare Blops 3 is 3 steps back in the evolution of this series. The campaign while enjoyable is the standard explosion filled 6 hour circle jerk of kill these things in a linear path towards your objective. The multiplayer is the biggest **** of all though. The exo system in AW was near perfect you could dodge using one click of the sticks in any3 Steps Back. Coming off of Advanced Warfare Blops 3 is 3 steps back in the evolution of this series. The campaign while enjoyable is the standard explosion filled 6 hour circle jerk of kill these things in a linear path towards your objective. The multiplayer is the biggest **** of all though. The exo system in AW was near perfect you could dodge using one click of the sticks in any direction without needing to use the jump button the exo system in AW made you feel like you had control being able to quickly evade bullets and attack back rather than slightly gliding to the left and dying faster than you can say **** And removing exo abilities just limits the amount of options you have to use. The customization was chipped too in AW there were hundreds of thousands of different armor pieces from common to elite to legendary if you wanted a damn clown mask mixed with a samurai chest piece you could do that but in BO3 your limited to 9 people with about 9 head and chest pieces that look ugly if you mix them. That's it. No really that's it. There is a weapon paintshop that no one uses though so yeah. The specialist weapons are cool but really just make you wish that they were just scorestreaks scorestreaks are also ****ed in AW you could customize your streaks if you wanted your carepackage to explode if an enemy tried to take it you could do that if you wanted the points to carry over if you die you could do that. Basically in a nutshell this game limits everything that you do dynamic maps that change (like the map that is split into 2 parts where halfway through the map you are forced to switch sides) are gone the gun range is gun one hit melees are gone. Like i said 3 steps back.,7,For the lazy guys :- Campaign : 3/10- Zombies : 7/10- Multiplayer : 7/10- General aspects & content : 6.5/10Campaign mode is the big problem of this game it suffers of poor textures and the story is very strange bad narrated and boring.

It becomes even worse when you discover that youFor the lazy guys :- Campaign : 3/10- Zombies : 7/10- Multiplayer : 7/10- General aspects & content : 6.5/10 Campaign mode is the big problem of this game it suffers of poor textures and the story is very strange bad narrated and boring. IA is dumb as hell and the special abilities of your character are totally useless in-game. It becomes even worse when you discover that you have a constant wallhack-ability that you can use during the whole campaign it kills immersion and element of surprise. There are a lot of graphic and technical bugs. Dialogues are the worst part of this game (for example your character speaks and suddenly his voice becomes very different and louder like if they changed their micros to record the voices during the development of the game) so is audio mixing in general but I played it in French it may be better in English. Some missions are repetitive (especially the last one which feels like a mix of all the other ones) Zombie mode feels immediately better. The only big problem is that the game came out with 2 maps but you had to pay the expensive $80-90 edition to get the 2 of them. I don't like day-one DLCs.It remains a cool mode and the fans love it. I personally am less hyped because I prefer a "simple" zombie with the main aim of doing as many rounds as possible but in BO3 they decided to work on a lot of details and there's a lot of stuff to do in this zombie mode. Secret rooms riddles to solve portals special types of zombies and so on I have to admit that it is positive and it gives TreyArch some credit it fills the gap of their poor Campaign mode.The general atmosphere is amazing in zombie mode great sounds amazing colors and it is perfectly fluid. More specifically like I said the map vast but I'm not a fan of its particular architecture they can do better and they proved it in the past on WAW BO1 & BO2. Multiplayer stays a reference but is far to be perfect.The first big problem: the maps all feel the same 3-rows maps which ruins rush opportunities in modes like S&D; and which encourages people to camp more.Second problem: Killstreaks in game modes like domination they are easy to unlock and lead to a real mess on smaller mapsThird problem: What happened to the sniper rifles ? They feel weird and are less enjoyable.The specialists are a good innovation but some of them shouldn't exist like the one which allows you to be almost invincible during a short time.Another big problem is matchmaking if you don't play with friends in most of the cases the games will be really unbalanced. It may be common to every other FPS but IMO it is more pronounced in BO3. Weapons balance also remains problematic but not as much as in Advanced Warfare.Finally hardcore mode is still neglected and the 3-rows maps ruin S&D; even more. In more general aspects the game is very fluid (60 fps) the weapons are beautifully designed and every single accessory is modelled which is great. However graphics are getting old in Campaign mode and are not revolutionary in the other modes (but let's be clear it still looks good in Zombie mode and Multiplayer mode),8,After almost crying because of laughter while reading all of these reviews I figured I should actually give it an honest review. I'd also like to respond to a lot of the stupidity that has caused me so much joy over the past hour. Campaign-Follows the same formula as a lot of the previous titles. Short large action sequences not a great story(but not a bad one either) andAfter almost crying because of laughter while reading all of these reviews I figured I should actually give it an honest review. I'd also like to respond to a lot of the stupidity that has caused me so much joy over the past hour. Campaign-Follows the same formula as a lot of the previous titles. Short large action sequences not a great story(but not a bad one either) and something to do other than multiplayer or zombies. All in all it's OK. 5/10 Multiplayer-This is where BO3 truly shines. Multiplayer has great overall balance within specialists guns and scorestreaks. There aren't any "oh damn I got shot by another Obsidian Steed BAL" moments (like in AW) which is nice. In all of the games that I have played I have been killed by the widest arrangement of weapons and perks in the past 5 CoDs combined. They are also following the same traditional DLC template as the other games by offering them in clumps of 5 maps per release (4 MP and 1 Zombies) at the same price as they always have.9.5/10 Zombies-Another awesome experience within Shadows of Evil as Treyarch never disappoints. They offer a deep easter egg filled map with plenty to experiences to figure out. If you aren't in to the new style of map with a load of easter eggs then they added The Giant as well just good ol' classic zombie kililng. The giant is an excellent remaster of Der Riese keeping enough of the old fun while adding tiny new wrinkles to keep it interesting. 'nuff said!10/10 Nightmares-Interesting choice to add on an additional zombies/campaign mode once the campaign has been completed. It's actually quite a bit of fun to jump in with a few buddies and play altered versions of the campaign with zombie elements. I just feel that with a very mediocre story within the campaign this mode is a fun but easily passed by by the casual fan.7/10 Now the fun part...RANT!To all you idiots calling this game "half done" "too many features (lol!)" and an "overpriced waste of 60 dollars" shut up. Seriously just shut your mouth. This is quite literally the most complete CoD in a very long time. Everything works lag is extremely minimal framerate is where it needs to be and the game runs very smooth. I'm not entirely sure what you are expecting? A free CoD game? As for the microtransactions? EVERY GAME HAS THEM NOW! These are 100% cosmetic and have no influence how the game is played. Like me I am choosing to play the game to unlock Cryptokeys to unlock the black market chests. But do you know why they choose to sell them? PEOPLE BUY THEM! I have zero issues with people spending additional money on colors taunts or gestures. It is absolute astounding how gamers now feel that they are entitled to having everything for the least amount of money and effort to earn them. People are going to blindly hate on this game only because it is a CoD whether or not it's a good or bad entry into the series.,6,I've only just picked up Black Ops 3 I was sceptical as I always am with Call of Duty as to whether or not it would actually be any good.And it is for me a return to form for the franchise after the awful ghosts and terrible Advanced Warfare.The story is full of intrigue and action with some brilliant set pieces and some great acting it's reasonably long too for a Call of DutyI've only just picked up Black Ops 3 I was sceptical as I always am with Call of Duty as to whether or not it would actually be any good.And it is for me a return to form for the franchise after the awful ghosts and terrible Advanced Warfare.The story is full of intrigue and action with some brilliant set pieces and some great acting it's reasonably long too for a Call of Duty game I've been going for about 4 hours now and granted I am playing on realistic which is a great new difficulty mode I would normally have stormed through by now. It's not the best story but it's by far better than the last few instalments.It's nice to have zombies back properly on next gen and not the rip off job that AW tried to pull off interesting new characters and enemies make for constant fun. The new maps are pretty well designed and the gobblegum system adds some new dynamics a little too assisting for me though.The multiplayer is great the cyber augments give just the right amount of pace there's jumping and wall running but no flying around to the extremes of advanced warfare; meaning you can take someone out with ease if you've a decent aim.The maps are easy to get used too with a few plays and they're just the right size to keep the pace going.the servers are pretty bad however and lad seems to prevail even on a wired connection running 40mb/s.Guns and explosions all sound good but the graphics are lagging behind; the dated engine struggling to keep up in some areas and it shows at times alas the frame rate has been consistent.Overall a good return to form and Treyarch have proven once again that they are the only company of the trio that can pull off a decent Call of Duty.Story: 5/10Multiplayer: 7/10 (would be 9/10 but Minus 2 for terrible servers)Zombies: 7/10 (Ditto above)Visuals: 4/10Overall 5.75/10,4,Call of duty hasn't been good since the original Black ops.

Dislikes meh at this point it's a tradition that Call of Duty never fixes any of their issues.  Same old **** applies here.  However the more I played this the more I was reminded why I stopped playing CoD after Blops 2 (Had and sort of liked Ghosts thought it was better than Blops 2 as well but no one played it so I stopped).  The sad thing is that I don't know anyone even though I KNOW there are people out who are having this issue the spawning.  It's worse than ever before I probably average 10 seconds per life I used to be good at CoD and I still can be but it's become unplayable due to spawn camping you seriously can't run for 2 seconds without getting shot and killed by someone you can't see.  It doesn't help that the weapons are as weak as Blops 2 with very little stopping power although they finally made Light Machine guns powerful as well as certain assault rifles but certain guns like every SMG the Locust Sniper Rifle among others are the worst guns I've ever used. This being all said Blops 3 was fine for a CoD game maybe it was the fact I hadn't played a CoD game in a long time that made me want to play this.  I haven't played the campaign nor will I ever I heard it was dumber than ever.,9,Im playing this game since nov 2015 and Im still loving it. That's the testament of a good game. I love the campaign its single player or co-op and done very well. Interesting story lots of varied missions just solid. tons of replay ability.

Its great to just play all different modes with bots. Zombies they've taken it to a new level here. There are things to do and it's much more flushed out. There are a few cool extra modes besides the main 3 free run nightmares mode (2nd campaign with zombies) dead ops arcade 2 & combat immersion mode. These all are fun mode and co-op as well. I love they now have a safe house where you can go and chill before missions build guns change outfits upgrade cyber cores whatever. You can also do combat simulations here too. I can't say enough about this package. I only played call of duty black ops 1 & 2 so Im not a call of duty guy I a black ops guy though... lol. I was concerned they were starting a new story line that maybe it would be not good or lame but surprise surprise!!! Highly recommended!,1,Played every console CoD game and this is the first I gave up on the campaign. What a terrible story and the mutiplayer looks like a Trevor Philips dream... messed up,7,Surprisingly another step forward for COD. Bringing in another solid campaign and multiplayer to the table. Yes there are many re used stuff and what not but it can be fun at times.,7,I seriously don't understand all the hate. The campaign is just ok (better with friends) but everything else is pretty solid. The guns and movement feel great the game looks amazing and multiplayer is a blast. Playing on the couch with a friend is really where the game shines though. 1v1ing and shooting up zombies with a buddy provides nearly endless fun. But in all honesty thereI seriously don't understand all the hate.

Playing on the couch with a friend is really where the game shines though. 1v1ing and shooting up zombies with a buddy provides nearly endless fun. But in all honesty there isn't anything special here. It's a fast paced arcady shooter with minimal thought or strategy involved during gameplay. Sure it's fun to shoot up some people in multiplayer for a bit but typical to cod games it has no real depth. All in all there's a lot of fun to be had but the game itself really isn't that great.,5,Meh. The games is mediocre due to the fact that-The campaign is boring and just a long slang it just sucks.-The zombie game mode is meh it's just not adventurous enough like Black ops II and the previous games with zombies are.-The online multiplayer is glitchy and isn't really appealing.-The characters are forgettable-HOW THE HELL IS THERE NO PAUSE GAME IN OFFLINEMeh. The games is mediocre due to the fact that -The campaign is boring and just a long slang it just sucks. -The zombie game mode is meh it's just not adventurous enough like Black ops II and the previous games with zombies are. -The online multiplayer is glitchy and isn't really appealing. -The characters are forgettable -HOW THE HELL IS THERE NO PAUSE GAME IN OFFLINE MODE???

The strong suit of the franchise has always had solid FPS driven action supporting a story that is equal parts engaging and unmemorable.  Multiplayer and and zombies are the biggest attractions to the Black Ops games and in that respect it does not disappoint as it checks all the right boxes. For thoseBlack Ops stays true to the current COD formula whether you love it or hate it.

If you are inexorably attracted to the craziness that is Zombie mode you won't be disappointed. "So what is with the lower score then?" I hear you ask.  This is completely subjective so take it for what it is but if you can identify with some of my sentiment then you will likely feel similar toward this game.  Black OPs and more specifically the CoD franchise as a whole has really burned me out.  I have been playing since the first MW and have just become really burned out by the constant effort to churn out games every year. Innovation and integrating their tried and true FPS twitch gameplay with something that brings fresh air to the franchise is ideally what CoD needs.  After CoD Ghosts it became pretty clear what to come to expect from this franchise for the forseeable future and I am not buying anymore.  The only reason I played this was because it was a Christmas gift.  I played the campaign and beat it but couldn't tell you what it was about.  I played zombies a little bit with my brothers but grew tired of it rather quickly (I have never enjoyed the zombie mode except for the very first one in World at War.  Those were simpler times).  Multiplayer was largely the same and it didn't take long before i had experienced all the game had to offer and sold it. I have fond memories of the franchise and would like nothing else than to buy a CoD game and enjoy it.  However I think the franchise needs to do some soul searching and take risks to reinvigorate the player base and shake off the CoD stereotype.  Until that time I will not pay money for another CoD game.,4,This without fail get a 4 in my book as the mp gets boring fast... but the graphics is really amazing though. I get the PS4 version. Graphically amazing super smooth & colourful which I highly appreciate. The thing is pretty graphics alone dont make a game fun or lasting. This is a major letdown. The MP is kinda mindless shooting & fast aim competition. Thats about it.OnlyThis without fail get a 4 in my book as the mp gets boring fast... but the graphics is really amazing though. I get the PS4 version.

I love it there was slight issues with the PS4 connectivity but seems like they have sorted that out and I really like the game. I mainly do arena and in public I do domination etc. Competitive side tbh!,8,I was really excited about BOIII being announced and it met expectations.

The Multiplayer: The specalists are very nice for casual gamers but honestly... it sucks to be killed by them shortly before you got your nuclear medal. The gun feeling is good like it was in BO2 and the new movement is also not that bad but you should change your buttes layout ( ´L2´ > Jump  ´X´ > Tactical). The maps are really nice but you´ll get often killed from behind and the streaks are a bit to weak. Last but NOT least... - 3. The Zombies-Mode: [Shadows of Evil] Honestly the zombies mode is f*cking awesome. It will take you a few attempts and maybe a few youtube tutorials til you understand everything. But then it´s really cool and the main easter egg is epic. If you didn´t already played this awesome map ... then turn your console on and jump right into it. Worth it trust me. ( I like the 4 player coop the most )[The Giant]  A really good remake but unfortunately only for people who buyed the season pass or the deluxe edition. But also worth it. Conclusion: BO3 is a CoD with flaws but it´s a step into the right direction. It´s much better then AW was but not perfect. Don´t expect the best story you´ve ever played but if you are a zombie fan then go for it you´ll love it. And the Multiplayer fans?.. The maps are okay-good most of the guns are balanced so the multiplayer is a 7 out of 10.,1,The most  full in-depth and detailed review that I can possibly do: Wolfstein 3D with better graphics and... no that's pretty much it. Shame that once you have played 1 CoD (since WaW or MW2) you have played them all.,8,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        un gran call of duty es uno de los mas completos desde el modo campaña hasta el multijugador pasando por el modo zombi con un gran mapa y su campaña y unos ligeros guiños a su modo original.,2,The problem with this game is twofold.  Firstly the formula is starting to get very stale I struggle to notice any real differences with Advanced Warfare other than a few tweaks and a reskin.  Sure the 'powers' of specialists idea is nice to lean towards different modes but if you look at the online % everyones playing team deathmatch anyway and the silence on chat tells its own story.The problem with this game is twofold.

Maybe it needs to go back to a cleaner time WW2 again up the player count and encourage people to play some of the other modes. I like the new revamped zombie mode but it just screams cash-in to have one map.  The campaign is dreadful somehow quite a good concept became one of the most boring COD campaigns I've ever had to play through and it feels a real backward step particularly after Ghosts which tried to do something interesting.  Shame it only gets good once you've completed it. The saving grace is  the return 4 player casual co-op but the investment now into the loadouts skillsets and tweaks means I'll struggle to persuade mates it's still fun for a blast which is a shame because wall running etc are filled with possibilities and the kill time is now so low it's very hard to play a casual fun game. Generally it feels like to me COD's lost its way a bit the element of 'fun' seems crushed under a desire to overwhelm the player with a mass of options and unlocks and each year it seems to become less of a fun game to play and more of a training ritual.  This year just seems to have dropped a few more notches than the last iterations.,7,Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 feels different but familiar at the same time.

The story itself is good but I lost interest from the confusing storyline and in the end things got weird and at that point i had invested too much time to quit then. The zombies campaign sounds like a cool idea but just feels like it was thrown together at the last minute. Multiplayer adds new dimensions to the game by adding water and the ability to run on walls and when these features are used properly can lead to high killstreaks. Every other aspect feels the same and almost worn out. Zombies feels different and in my opinion almost too different. Overall the new features to the game are fun but all too familiar7/10JB,9,Best Call of Duty since Black Ops 2. The movement system is new and interesting without being as janky as Advanced Warfare's. The story is interesting albeit not ground breaking. The multiplayer is amazingly addictive. A few server issues aside and I am spending way too much time on it.,8,As a 40-year old casual gamer I only ever play multiplayer TDM or Domination so my score is only based on those modes.

At first I hated it 'cause it's ridiculous but I have to admit it's grown on me. I'm now hoping the DLC maps will include Nuke3town and hopefully a remake of the yacht map on BO2. The cons with BO3 is mainly the waiting time after a finished match. I think the showcasing of the top 3 players is stupid and it takes way too long between matches.,1,Campaign from what I could stomach to play is not very fun or creative. Multi Player  which is usually my favorite part is very cartoonish and the maps are meh nothing too thrilling. I was very excited for this release and now I have no idea why.....I wouldnt waste the money.,9,This game really fun however the leader boards are already hacked on PS4 and the jet packs took players a little too high in the game like halo.

This is what Treyarch does best! Yea you may have seen the thruster packs from titan fall first but those people knew what cod was doing cuz they worked there first. It's called "tend setting" and so they take it and make it better. Nothing wrong with that they made it better. It's on the line of just right! Game is great! and I think zombies and the other secret things you can do in this game are perfectly combined. So much to do in this game! Arena for MP is one of the most innovative things i have seen yet from Treyarch.These are just a few yes a few things that you will enjoy in this game. I say give it a try! If you don't like competitive games for MP go play TitanFall and kill some bots then.,8,Can't belive so much people hates this game. It's a big improvement over Black Ops 2 and I almost always have a good time with story mode. Pretty good graphics as well and I didn't run into any glitches so this game has to be loved more.,9,In my opinion easily the most interesting story arc out of any of the CoD games. Not to say the *writing* is very good or even above average. The dialogue and interpersonal interactions fall flat quite frequently but the ideas behind the story arc are fantastic. The idea of having the direct neural interface sequences is brilliant leading to a feeling that "all bets are off" andIn my opinion easily the most interesting story arc out of any of the CoD games. Not to say the *writing* is very good or even above average. The dialogue and interpersonal interactions fall flat quite frequently but the ideas behind the story arc are fantastic. The idea of having the direct neural interface sequences is brilliant leading to a feeling that "all bets are off" and allowing some brilliantly ridiculous sequences. The free-running mechanic from multiplayer is present however its uses are more limited due to the level design. Where the futuristic concept really comes to shine however is in the cyber cores. Allowing the player to use only one branch of skills at a time adds a lot of incentive for replaying the missions trying out different tactics and works particularly well in Co-Op. The campaign is approximately 12 hours long but gets doubled with the "aww f*ck it let's have some fun" Nightmares mode where you play through the same levels but in a different order and with a completely unique storyline... and zombies.,9,Best Call of Duty since Black Ops 2. Multiplayer feels wonderful not gimmicky like Advanced Warfare. The specialists are a welcome addition but sometimes they can piss you off. The guns feel nice balanced and well rounded but some feel a little melty but it is nothing to bad. Scorestreaks are good and not to over or underpowered. Long time favorites are back and some new are here suchBest Call of Duty since Black Ops 2. Multiplayer feels wonderful not gimmicky like Advanced Warfare. The specialists are a welcome addition but sometimes they can piss you off. The guns feel nice balanced and well rounded but some feel a little melty but it is nothing to bad. Scorestreaks are good and not to over or underpowered. Long time favorites are back and some new are here such as the DART. Overall Multiplayer is a solid 9.5/10.Now we reach Campaign. I have not played much of it but what I have played feels better that AW's and Ghosts's campaign. Thought it is still not as fun as BO2's which is my favorite COD campaign of all time. Once you beat the Campaign once you can go back and play it with Zombies added some replay ability or you can access it with the cheat DREAMLAND.  Overall Campaign is an 8/10.Zombies is back and full of more Easter eggs than ever. It is still as fun as before and this is not much else to say other than I wish there was another map or like in BO2 where it could be sectioned off. Overall it is a refeshing 9/10.,6,It's a good call of duty better than 2 last (Advanced warfareghosts) good game for CoD fans but again the same year after year the specialist are a good idea and this limited super-jump its nice too Good zombies mode but not like black ops 1 maybe in next dlc's they will release better maps but shadows of evil its a bit boring because it has a lot of crafts like in black ops 2.It's a good call of duty better than 2 last (Advanced warfareghosts) good game for CoD fans but again the same year after year the specialist are a good idea and this limited super-jump its nice too Good zombies mode but not like black ops 1 maybe in next dlc's they will release better maps but shadows of evil its a bit boring because it has a lot of crafts like in black ops 2.If You're CoD fan buy it if you didn't liked the last CoD's because are the same don't buy this CoD.,2,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Call of duty games are usually GREAT!! The story mode and online! However online gaming for this is not good at all all the juming around. COD Ghost was much better,8,Well i still miss the days of actual modern combat but this was a well done version of a futuristic setting. The multiplayer was redone with the new operators feature which was pretty cool.,3,This game is terrible It's the biggest CoD Cliche EVER! someone close to the team goes bad and it makes them sad. I feel I have seen this before oh wait I have. Anyways this game is action packed but has a confusing and kind of pointless story. Multiplayer is lacking for fun.,8,It's freaking dumb who write negative reviews.The game isn't perfect but it isn't a piece of crap.The focus of the game is to entertain whoever plays it.And if u aren't entertained by this game u sure have serious problems.And for the people who says "it's not a COD"I answer:They have to make something new that innovates the saga.,8,more of a multiplayer game not too much of a story driven game prefferable a game for people who want to kill time but its not a horrible game good graphics and gameplay,7,Black Ops 3 is a great game but it's not amazing it is plagued by the same problems that every Call of Duty has. Bad spawns terrible matchmaking and horrendous team balance. But that's just multiplayer. The campaign is forgettable like almost every COD but Black Ops 3 zombies is a bit different from the other COD zombies so if your playing it just for zombies I'm pretty sure you'llBlack Ops 3 is a great game but it's not amazing it is plagued by the same problems that every Call of Duty has.

The campaign is forgettable like almost every COD but Black Ops 3 zombies is a bit different from the other COD zombies so if your playing it just for zombies I'm pretty sure you'll love it. The game could be 9/10 if they fixed multiplayer and put more effort into the campaign.,3,One of the worst Call of Duty. Poor performance multiplayer with the launch connection problems in South America DLCs that require the purchase of season pass at launch (Zombies The Giant) microtransaction buy coins to get items (this is a free to play? No longer enough to season pass?) zombies mode without content much less content compared to Black Ops 2. the only good thing reallyOne of the worst Call of Duty.

No longer enough to season pass?) zombies mode without content much less content compared to Black Ops 2. the only good thing really interesting is the cooperative campaign and nightmare mode the multiplayer is at best average. The platinum trophy gets to be abusive.,9,I am very pleased with Black Ops 3. In an HONEST opinion I feel that this game is pretty solid and Treyarch is working hard to fix minor flaws. I haven't had this much fun playing a COD game since the last Black Ops title. The campaign was amazing it wasn't perfect but it kept me intrigued with it throughout its entirety. It was intense from the beginning and the ending is worth it. II am very pleased with Black Ops 3. In an HONEST opinion I feel that this game is pretty solid and Treyarch is working hard to fix minor flaws. I haven't had this much fun playing a COD game since the last Black Ops title. The campaign was amazing it wasn't perfect but it kept me intrigued with it throughout its entirety. It was intense from the beginning and the ending is worth it. I loved it and I tell everyone I know to play it but nobody ever does. Zombies for the die hard zombies fan is a great mode in its own regard. I am more of a classic Zombies player where the only goal was to survive to as high of a round as possible. I don't really enjoy all of this extra stuff they have added to make it seem like more a story based mode but I can step back and say that it was a good idea but not for everyone. As for the multiplayer oh boy do I get into it. The past two years I played online for like an hour and i would get bored but now i can't find a way to let go of my controller. They did a good job with adding a LOT of challenges and unlocks. I will never do them all but I will definitely be busy until next years COD. The specialists are cool kill streaks finally do something again guns are decently balanced a few need a nerf or buff but Treyarch is hard at work to fix all of that. Honestly anyone who doesn't like this game is not a COD fan and there is nothing wrong with that or they played the game did really bad and called it quits. Either way I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a way to kill time.,3,Game: Problems;Way too many bugs across the game.It has too many features because of this it feels highly unfinished. Even after the patch huge bugs still exist.Treyarch have bitten off way more than they can chew.It is aimed way too close to the pro gamers it's almost as if casual gamers haven't been given any thought.There is typos in the subtitles! Ha!Good points;AGame: Problems;Way too many bugs across the game.It has too many features because of this it feels highly unfinished. Even after the patch huge bugs still exist.Treyarch have bitten off way more than they can chew.It is aimed way too close to the pro gamers it's almost as if casual gamers haven't been given any thought.There is typos in the subtitles! Ha! Good points;A lot of customization to change the look of things and the custom emblems are back which is amazing and there are a lot of calling cards with many different accomplishments so there is always some target to aim for. Other points;The gunsmith is pretty pointless as far as I'm concerned custom emblems and paint jobs are awesome as is the ability to post you creative genius online to show others. Campaign: Problems;Levels are too long.Recruit it way beyond the level of difficulty it should be. On recruit I should be able to do ridiculously stupid things and be able to get away with it. I lowered the difficulty while I was playing because I simply couldn't deal with it; it wasn't fun and even on recruit it isn't fun. Now I wouldn't call myself a pro gamer but I wouldn't call myself a casual gamer either I'm sort of in the middle.The levels take way too long to load and the cutscenes are horrific to have to sit and watch and if you have music playing in the background the game pauses it! So you can listen to the long winded and boring cutscenes which you can skip after you've already shot yourself or ejected the disk so you can play a good game.Furthermore the story is way too misleading and confusing that I decided that I just wasn't going to follow it which completely ruins the idea behind the campaign.And the hold x to skip takes about 7 seconds to work which is so irritating. It's almost as if it's saying I have bad reflexes as if it's saying "We had better make sure the player actually wants to skip this annoying dirt pile."The cyber core things just get forgotten about and are just confusing.Grenades for the enemy are way too overpowered and just get annoying.Friendly AI is appalling. Good points;It is long so if your imagination is an empty and dark room it is bearable.There are custom load outs if you want to make one.Ammo boxes and the ability to switch your load out points are situated around the map but you don't need to use them if you don't want to.You can create a custom character to play the campaign with.4 player intervention that is completely optional. Summary; bad and fails to build on and take advantage of what was so good in black ops 1 and 2. Most fun part is being able to blow your self up using explosive things on the levels! Please note that this campaign review is based upon playing the campaign on recruit difficulty. 3/10 Multiplayer: Problems;For some reason you can get 16 players in a 12 players max lobby which means the game can't start.If your in a party it often seems to split the players some go into a match and others are left searching.The matchmaking and weapon balancing is about as good as trying to play on a see saw with your pet elephant.Two hit melee... unless you have a combat knife which is an unlock by level and takes up a slot in your custom class. This alone fails the game.Now the specialists. They are a lot like tranzit from Black Ops 2. A fantastic idea executed badly.The movement system is silly and complicated and often really annoying. Good points;Nice customization on the specialists.Good range of guns.Access to custom classes from level one but also has the pre-made classes with higher level guns and perks.Good range of maps.Classic killstreaks are back which is amazing. New killstreaks are great and balanced though sometimes glitchy.Summary;Good customization and new streaks bad everything else.2/10Zombies:Problems;1 classic weapon raygun which seems worse than it was before. Why is there no Galil or M16?On the giant the wunderwaffe is completely broken and killed hype.You need to do a glitch to pack a punch the wonder weapon in shadows of evil and the rituals are unbalanced so all the players need to be in the room to get it done in reasonable time and the Easter egg is not a single player one so people who like solo on zombies can't have as much fun as they want to and should be able to have.Shadows of evil is incredibly glitchy and on the difficult side of things.Massive pop in of objects and render distance is terrible.Good points;You don't need to use the gumballs if you don't want to.I'm sure the story will come clear very soon.Crafting has returned and is fantastic. So is the shield with a vengeance and rockets! :)The giant brings back a great map with added features but still delivers the sand fun feeling as Der Reise did.Summary;Zombies is the only thing Treyarch got right. But it's not great.7/10Overall;The game has failed it feels highly unfinished and is scattered with bugs.,6,This is my honest opinion on BO3. Black ops 3 isn't a f*ckin terrible game but theres also nothing that makes it stand out from other call of duty games. The campaign is the worst part of BO3 in my opinion. The campaign starts off okay but once I got about a third into I was continually asking myself what is going on? why is this happening? Why is there a WW2 mission is this game? Why isThis is my honest opinion on BO3. Black ops 3 isn't a f*ckin terrible game but theres also nothing that makes it stand out from other call of duty games. The campaign is the worst part of BO3 in my opinion. The campaign starts off okay but once I got about a third into I was continually asking myself what is going on? why is this happening? Why is there a WW2 mission is this game? Why is there almost nothing that connects it to other treyarch CODs?. The campaign felt like a chore I really didn't want to do but I pushed myself to the end. Nightmare mode is the same thing but with zombies as enemies. If I was to say anything good about the campaign is that you can 4 player co op and you can pick your loadout which is something carried over from BO2 this allows you to explore and experiment with different weapons and abilities. The multiplayer and zombies do fair better then the campaign. Multiplayer runs very smoothly at 60fps but the multiplayer feels like a direct reskin of BO2 but with jumping and swimming mechanics. Weather that's a good or bad thing is up to you. I would have liked to have seen more brand new modes but Im sure those are to come. It still holds all of the classic modes from previous CODs. Now for the zombies the main reason I bought the game. Zombie mode feels much harder and more complicated then ever before. I didn't enjoy as much as previous zombie modes but it is more challenging then previous games weather that's a good thing or not is entirely up to you. Der reise makes a return as the giant but it honestly doesn't feel the same. DLC is the same a season pass and personalization packs. Overall this game is a 6/10 Its a solid shooter for sure its not bad but its also not particularly good either. Im sure this will be a 7/10 once they bring out all the dlc. Thanks for reading.,3,As a full priced game (60€) that also has a 50€ Season Pass (which is already absurd) it is unacceptable that in the game there were added micro transactions that can change certain gameplay elements like in the zombies game mode. Activision is making the first few steps on making Call of Duty a even bigger milking facility please do not buy in on this game.

Only good will come off of that. The reason im not going lower that 3 is because the game itself isn't that bad but many elements just makes the game a waste of money.,6,The call of duty titles just seem to get worse every time a new one is released. The graphics on this are gorgeous but the multiplayer and singleplayer is basically donald trump getting elected for president: its horrible.The zombies mode on this however is oddly delightful. The new train mechanic serves as a decent replacement for the bus.If you like to purchase every cod title justThe call of duty titles just seem to get worse every time a new one is released.

The new train mechanic serves as a decent replacement for the bus.If you like to purchase every cod title just for the zombies then go right ahead. If you like to purchase it for the single player and multiplayer then this is not for you. This game in conclusion is basically just a slap to the face for all cod fans. Lets hope that next years installment makes up for it.,9,Has all the hallmarks of a call of duty game and they somehow managed to add even more. Excellent entry in the series and the multiplayer is a next level of play. Loses 1 point for not punishing campers as much as I would like.,8,This game is like your average Call of Duty game. I'd say the campaign is quite bad but most people play for the multiplayer - which is good. The only issue is the occasional lag which can be improved by using an Ethernet cable. The zombies are also fun but not worth buying just for zombies if you see what I mean. Overall it is worth buying at a discounted price and don't expect a masterpiece.,9,I cannot believe some of the negative reviews from other gamers. How does this game have a lower user score than Primal Carnage Extinction and Deadpool? Anyway Call of Duty Black Ops III is one of the best games of 2015. The multiplayer and campaign is highly addictive and the core gameplay and graphics is certainly better than a 4.5/10.,1,Giving it a one instead of a zero only because it isn't unplayable.

Zombies is milking a dead cow. MP is made for 12-Y-Os who have their parent's money to throw into its 'supply drop' micro transactions. Instead of fixing instant max level modders and numerous map glitches Treyarch has been making it more difficult to earn in-game currency and reducing drop rates of the most desired items in the supply drops. Typical Activision money grabbing do not purchase. Gets boring very quickly. Hopefully this is not a trend all future CoD games will embody but sadly that seems to be the case.,3,As one reviewer put it best - "It’s a grand and gaudy spectacle of incoherence that will likely be difficult to remember but was a sight to see while it lasted",6,The online multiplayer is really funbut then you have the campaign which is really weirdI was hoping for a follow up to Black Ops 2 since you knowthis is black ops 3 after all. and the zombies is really complex and I don´t really understand all the mechanics.

Sorry guys,3,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Giving it a 3 out of 10 for Story: IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BLACK OPS 1 AND 2 [Looks like The staff at Treyarch weren't smelling their own farts] i don't give a flying **** about the COOP mode in the single player campaign because it ADDED NOTHING and for the ****ing record i never played WAW in COOP so to those who will **** on me for saying that Multiplayer: Thanks to Advanced **** bunny hopping is a cool thing in the game *Sarcasm* [it sucks also in the campaign too] Look i don't mind the setting [OLD SCHOOL MODERN FUTURISTIC] AS LONG AS IT'S ****ING BOOTS ON THE MOTHER****ING GROUND weapons and maps are not that great especially the fan fav maps and weapons that are provided by the season pass [previously all weapons released in updates were only accessible in supply drops but that doesn't change anything infact it makes it even worse] Zombies: the only thing that was entertaining in THE WHOLE ****ING GAME! HOWEVER i refuse to waste ****ING 50 bucks on the season pass to play on zombies maps ONLY Thanks to Cocktivision and **** for ****ing the sequel to the game that i really wanted to like it i traded this game with The Last Of Us i'll make a review of it soon NOTE:  the level SAND CASTLE is THE EXACT ****ING CARBON COPY OF THE LAST LEVEL IN BLACK OPS 1 WOOOOH ****ING INNOVATION,9,Wonderful game! Multiplayer maps are great although combine is a bit too popular. Campaign is great too and zombies is very very fun. Not the best Call of Duty but is by far the best since Black Ops 2.,5,All bells no whistles.  The art for this game is absolutely stunning and fun.  It makes you excited when you're creating your classes customizing your specialist and getting ready to play.  But that's where the fun ends.  Once you join a game frustration will quickly ensue.  The game play is very inconsistent and you'll find yourself yelling obscenities to at your screen in no time.All bells no whistles.  The art for this game is absolutely stunning and fun.

The game play is very inconsistent and you'll find yourself yelling obscenities to at your screen in no time.  The matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired and the game lags really bad.  Half a second doesn't sound like a lot of time but when you're in a multiplayer match it means the world.  More times than not it feels like you're playing half a second behind any other opposing player.  You run around a corner see an opponent and before you even have a chance to think about what you need to do you fall down dead. Before purchasing this game keep checking the COD community for positive feedback.  The site is currently a bed of negative comments which Activision and Treyarch are flat out ignoring.  Maybe in March 2016 when they roll out the new DLC things will improve.  But as of the time of this review the game isn't worth it.  If you love hours of frustration and always playing angry...this game is for you.  If not spend your money on something else.,1,This game could be really good but they ruined it!

The best part of the game is the zombies it's really good i always have a good time on this mode but even when every thing is perfect they ruin things. They made only one map in the game ONE SINGLE MAP just to make sure that every body will buy the season pass. Im really disappointed with treyarch and activision they don't care about their fans anymore the game industry is all about the money nowadays.,7,Ok this is a review of the multiplayer only since i haven't touched campaign or zombies yet and after playing bo2 its kinda obvious how those two modes are going to be like.On to the multiplayer ok first things first match making is not great takes some time to find matches and people only play dom and tdm. I have had lag issues and its not just my internet its the hosts connection.Ok this is a review of the multiplayer only since i haven't touched campaign or zombies yet and after playing bo2 its kinda obvious how those two modes are going to be like.On to the multiplayer ok first things first match making is not great takes some time to find matches and people only play dom and tdm. I have had lag issues and its not just my internet its the hosts connection. (activision billion dollar company and no dedicated servers...). Maps are ehh but obviously since there brining back old maps into map packs they gotta make more money. Maps could have better layout but some are ok.  Graphics are fine for console no problems here. Guns.... as usual smgs are op and everything else takes some "skill" to use but smgs are spray and pray (vesper). The specialist are  cool but some are obviously better than others but are are playable if you get used to their abilities. Last but not least is the extra content aka customization. You can customize alot of your online charecter and thats really cool (gun paint specialist skin emblem etc) some stuff you get from micro-trans but its optional of course. This was my first cod since bo2 and it brings back some memories i still wish it played like old cod and didn't have thrusting and wall running tho. In the end the multiplayer does not deserve a 10 5 or 0. id give at the worst a 6.7 and at best a 7.9.,1,Not a copy of Titanfall lmao gud game HA! : PRANKSTED! **** 60€ **** WITH DLCs AND **** 100€ **** CAMPAING IT'S LIKE THE RETARDED BROTHER OF TITANFALL WITH LITTLE MAPS AND BAD OPTIMITATION (AND THE **** GIANT ROBOTS ARE FUN M8) SERIOUSLEY I WANT TITANFALL 2 TO **** THE NEXT COD SO MUCH,8,black ops 3 is a really good game the way how multiplayer plays is very good the way how all the guns are so balanced and zombies is very good this year especially recreating der riese was amazing it plays exactly the same as how the map used to be but campaign is awful its just really boring and not good as call of duty campaigns used to be especially with MW2 and call of duty 4 possiblyblack ops 3 is a really good game the way how multiplayer plays is very good the way how all the guns are so balanced and zombies is very good this year especially recreating der riese was amazing it plays exactly the same as how the map used to be but campaign is awful its just really boring and not good as call of duty campaigns used to be especially with MW2 and call of duty 4 possibly having the best campaigns of all time.,5,Pros. Killing stuff cons.same as cod bo2 get metal gear solid v or the elder scrolls  v or rocket league or battelfield 4 or need for speed rivals or assassins creed black flag not this game,8,First off let's talk about value:1) You have campaign. I'm not such a fan with campaign since blops2 and I can't say that I will consider story mode at all even in this particular CoD. This does give a feature like WaW that allows you to play Co-op campaign which is nostalgia and great addition that should've been with every CoD game since WaW but failed in its predecessors.2)First off let's talk about value:1) You have campaign.

This does give a feature like WaW that allows you to play Co-op campaign which is nostalgia and great addition that should've been with every CoD game since WaW but failed in its predecessors. 2) Multiplayer - the icing on the cake that I play that seems to be balanced almost too balanced. The maps are a bit basic making the game almost too simple which make the 3-way map design generic. Sniping from blops2 aim assist is gone making it a diluted game play w/o snipers. Every game lobby you enter will have smgs or ARs which loses its luster after 2 months of playing this game continuously. 3) Zombie and arcade zombie: these are additions to the game which makes this game pretty valuable across the board. 4) innovation: You get the new mode called Free Run. Although there's not a lot going on it it is a step in the right direction as for innovation. It's stepping into boundaries of another game called Mirror's Edge which is something to be excited about. I wish they put more of an effort for this particular mode like Co-op and racing against others as well as shadow AI to see how players above you completed this course. I'm surprised at all that people are giving such low credit for this game as it is quite valuable for what they're giving you. Yes it is quantity over quality but allowing 4 games in one is still worth the price even when it's dropping substantially. Multiplayer: This is pretty much the only game mode I play which says a lot about me however I have tried all modes before giving this review. The multiplayer isn't as good as previous CoD games like blops2 or MW2. I feel as though this should've been released before AW as well to give people the chance to progress through y-axis movement. If anything this is an upgrade to blops2 with much slower gameplay even with boost movement is involved. The maps feel smaller than any of the basic previous Treyarch maps from blops1 blops2 and WaW. For maps being this small w/boost movements I must say they put things in a pickle. The game again is balanced. Almost too balanced. Shotguns aren't good anymore making them almost useless when it comes to basic TDM. Even the argus takes real skill for it to be par with the worst smg. Almost all ARs and smgs are relatively close to being the same weapon with minor tweaks like higher rpm better recoil or more damage. It's like they had a basic semi and gave the gun points for auto damage recoil magazine and rpm while making different combinations using the same point system just for guns to make their guns. Sniping is low tier due to the fact that aim assist is gone. Anyone who still uses sniper rifles in this particular CoD is using pure skill at this point. LMGs feel extremely heavy compared to blops2 but w/perk manipulation that some of the pubstompers have figured out you can use it almost like an AR. But because this game is faster paced for smgs to rule the game using LMG is outclassed in most situations besides modes like Domination and safeguard. I'm giving the game higher than 7 because of its value. If it didn't include the extra mode freerun I would've given it just 7 because it would've been a lesser version of blops2. I can't say this game for multiplayer is better than blops2 because of how generic the gameplay feels and the bland feeling that my opponent is either wielding an smg or AR rather than go shotgunning knifing sniper rifle or LMG.,5,I haven't played the other black ops game so I don't know the trend or how a black ops game should be like. In terms of shooting ok. Controls are fine not that many guns to choose from.The enemies blend in with the graphics and allies you don't know who you are suppose to shoot until they come close enough or they are the pointing the gun at you. I end up using the weird goggleI haven't played the other black ops game so I don't know the trend or how a black ops game should be like. In terms of shooting ok.

I end up using the weird goggle device so all the bad guys are in red. A great couch co-op game. Had loads of fun. Not sure if it works great if you play alone. Dont know about the story dont give a **** As long as I am progressing have all the levels and maps that's fine. The only down side is you cannot replay the levels unless you restart all over again. Zombie is a great mode but no story for that... It's like a survival mode where you fight waves of enemies over and over. For some reason I cannot skip the cutscenes right away. I have to watch 30 seconds of it before I can skip so annoying and boring. I watched it already. I just want to play the damn game. Dont know much about the online multiplayer local one is fine.,7,This game i believe to attempt to come back to call of duty's roots but its no Modern Warfare 1 or 2 but it does introduce a couple of improved mechanics from the old call of duty games and is leaps better than the previous two installments and i believe they are heading in the right direction although what I just discussed is true it does have its flaws as this game does a bit better jobThis game i believe to attempt to come back to call of duty's roots but its no Modern Warfare 1 or 2 but it does introduce a couple of improved mechanics from the old call of duty games and is leaps better than the previous two installments and i believe they are heading in the right direction although what I just discussed is true it does have its flaws as this game does a bit better job at bringing the community back together it still in some ways drives them further apart with the movement system which is something i enjoyed and much better than advanced warfare's bunny hoping simulator it leads me to give this game a 7/10 as its not bad and improves on the last two games of the series which made the franchise lose a lot of its customers,6,This installment of Call Of Duty is not a terrible game but it does fall short on a few things. Black Ops 3 is the best CoD I have played since Black Ops 2 as the previous 2 titles did not get my interest. I was kind of torn about the campaign in this game as it had a new story with new characters but it does not explain anything about the previous Black Ops games` story. One thing iThis installment of Call Of Duty is not a terrible game but it does fall short on a few things. Black Ops 3 is the best CoD I have played since Black Ops 2 as the previous 2 titles did not get my interest. I was kind of torn about the campaign in this game as it had a new story with new characters but it does not explain anything about the previous Black Ops games` story. One thing i will say though is that this is the most beautiful Call Of Duty game i have ever played as it is filled with more vibrant colours instead of grey and dull colours. I have not had a lot of time in the multiplayer but what i have played is just average Call Of Duty. The gunsmith and paintshop features a very interesting as the gunsmith allows you to create a variant to a weapon and the paintshop allows you to create your own camo for weapons. Zombies is the best thing about this game in my opinion. Shadows Of Evil features 4 new characters who are all portrayed by famous actors. The new leveling up system in zombies is a massive improvement from the Black Ops 2 system which hardly ever worked. Overall Black Ops 3 is not a perfect game but it is an improvement over the past two games we have been given. I recommend it if you are into casual FPS games or if you want to check out the zombies.,1,Was quite looking forward to this but am quite dissapointed with the campaign its beautiful graphics but it feels flat and at times feels quite lost. The multiplayer is the same as any other COD.,10,clearing out old review....................................................................................................................................,2,Man oh man. Trey Arc does it again. They've just about killed the franchise with this entry of the series. Holy. **** I can't even begin to describe how unoriginal this game is. If you need to play it to see for yourself be my guest.,0,This game is terrible across the board if you like wasting money on a game you'll hate playing after 2 hours this is definitely the game for you campaign sucks multiplayer is even worse than the campaign. the only thing even remotely redeemable about this game is zombies and i can't just on my ps4 and play that all day. not worth 60 bucks hell had i known what i know now about this game iThis game is terrible across the board if you like wasting money on a game you'll hate playing after 2 hours this is definitely the game for you campaign sucks multiplayer is even worse than the campaign. the only thing even remotely redeemable about this game is zombies and i can't just on my ps4 and play that all day. not worth 60 bucks hell had i known what i know now about this game i wouldn't be willing to pay 20 bucks for this game,5,Just finished the campaign and honestly was a let down. The story was a messed and didn't make sense...most call of duty games suffer from poor campaigns but this one is the worst of any game. Don't try playing campaign co-op I have a really good 55" TV and it looked like **** The multiplayer is not that good mostly run run kill kill die run kill. No strategy and almost zero skills.,3,I do not want to talk about this but Call of Duty is repeated too much and had declined in recent years but the plot is good only 4.6 points is intended for the plot the rest is not worth mentioning because too boring for the future war .,6,Puede que sea el mejor call of duty de nueva generación (Solo he probado este en PS4) Unos gráficos decentes aunque mejorables (La iluminación de los exteriores junto al cielo y el paisaje de fondo para mi es lo peor del multijugador y hablo de los mapas que vienen por defecto en el juego algunos mapas del primer dlc arreglan estos fallos para mi punto de vista deberían arreglarloPuede que sea el mejor call of duty de nueva generación (Solo he probado este en PS4) Unos gráficos decentes aunque mejorables (La iluminación de los exteriores junto al cielo y el paisaje de fondo para mi es lo peor del multijugador y hablo de los mapas que vienen por defecto en el juego algunos mapas del primer dlc arreglan estos fallos para mi punto de vista deberían arreglarlo porque la iluminación es bastante molesta) también me hubiera gustado una opción para alejar la cámara para ser nueva generación tener la cámara tan cerca me parece un mareo continuo. La campaña me a parecido buena junto con el primer Black Ops son las historias que mas me han gustado de todos los call of dutys que he probado que no son pocos (MW2/3 BO1/2/3) otro defecto del multijugador son las cajas de suministros han sacado como 9 o 10 armas y si no te salen no las vas a probar nunca me parece un error grave que no las den de regalo (ya les pagabamos bien para que luego no nos den esas cosas) me parece bien las cajas de suministros para trajes y camuflajes pero para las armas no. Yo personalmente estoy muy quemado de los shooters y dudo que me compre otro hasta dentro de mucho tiempo aun así me parece un buen juego y la nota que le pongo me parece la mas justa,7,Call Of Duty Black Ops 3 - I am not impressed with how C.o.D has made Black Ops 3 It has failed to bring what the community has asked for (World at War 2?)

I've enjoyed video games all my life and this one has been the biggest waste of money with close to zero enjoyment. Playing with a friend does make it bearable and somewhat fun other that that I may be done with the entire franchise because you can only put so much lipstick on the same old pig for so long.,6,Pro's:  Campagin Co-Op Dead Ops Arcade 2 Multiplayer specialistsCon's: Exo's Generic Campaign Very Boring  Nightmares  Zombies doesn't feel fun anymore --Supply drops make multiplayer unbalanced,10,I just love it because the multiplayer is awesomethe zombies are fantastic the campaign is no the best history ever but is good.I know a lot of people want back to the second war but if it back to the second the people gonna say:We wanna a future call of duty,7,As an avid Call Of Duty fan I can say that this franchise is starting to sink exponentially. The last two installments were very big letdowns and while this title is a definite improvement it still falls short in certain categories. At its core Call Of Duty has always been a casual shooter as in something you can put in and immediately and know how to play. It's has anAs an avid Call Of Duty fan I can say that this franchise is starting to sink exponentially. The last two installments were very big letdowns and while this title is a definite improvement it still falls short in certain categories. At its core Call Of Duty has always been a casual shooter as in something you can put in and immediately and know how to play. It's has an exponentially low skill ceiling (depending on your playstyle) and was always just a game you and your friends can have a good time in. The single player is pretty unique. Treyarch took a sort of tactical approach to the single player adding in special abilities and new features. The added different kinds of enemies into the mix such as robots and tank-like enemies called warlords of which contributes to the level of tactic and thought you must put in before tackling a level or location. The levels are very action packed as expected with every CoD. The multi-player in this game is a big improvement from Advanced Warfare but still has a few kinks. They took out the dreaded "exo-abilities" from the mix and instead replaced it with a thrust pack that can improve movement but doesn't let players fly around the entirety of the map. Combat is usually found on the ground and can be really intense and engaging especially with the wallrun ability. Weapon balance has improved greatly and lets players pick from a plethora of weapons that are viable in mutli-player. Another addition is the Specialist option which allows players to pick a character that has a set ability in the game.These abilities are viable and can be really useful but can sometimes be fairly unbalanced. Zombies in this game is very well done. The only new addition to zombies is the GobbleGum perks which are set abilities you can bring in and buy using points in the game. These are completely optional however and you don't really need to rely on them to go into high rounds. All around the game isn't bad. I give this a 7 because it's very easy to lose interest in. Around the time i got to 4th prestige i pretty much stopped playing as much as I used too. The matches themselves can get really repetitive and boring and zombies just seems to drag on after about round 25. All in all if you like CoD I'd say buy. If your not a fan of CoD see for yourself if you like it or not.,8,This game is a good change of the call of duty franchise the team at trey-arch really spent a while into this game and it is very fun to play.Only real problem with this game is that the 'future' style is getting quite stale but this has really over powered the previous game advanced warfare I would really suggest this game to anyone who likes first person shooters.,5,Es un jugo repetitivo lo unico bueno es los zombis  la campaña con un amigo esta bien solo no y el multi es flipante entre la conexion  fallos y desbalanceos . Penoso,10,Fantastic game. I never cared about cod campaign but the multiplayer and zombies are excellent. Loved black ops 2 and love black ops 3 .

The zombies is just a few bugs away from being the best zombies maps. Even If I did prefer the classic movement I think that the advanced movement was nailed down to the ground in this title.

I used to say that it was the same trash every year but I'm changing that now. It's worse every year lol. It really is.......,6,This is the first Call of Duty game that I've purchased since Modern Warfare 3 back in 2011 and it's exactly what I expected and no more.

Haven't played much multiplayer so this is almost strictly from the point of view of the campaign mode on "recruit". It took about half the game to understand all the mechanics not interested in finding every collectible or leveling up and don't want frustrating grinds to find the exact "right" route through a map... the ammo boxes were a bit too plentiful and the boss-type robots were a bit too repetitive and basically just a matter of firing and hiding for 20 minutes until you wear them down. But the graphics and sound were fun and the game has at least a hint of A.I. philosophy behind it and was about the right difficulty to just casually play when I had a few hours to relax. The ending was pretty fun especially the last 3 minutes when "White Rabbit" is playing in the background.I don't generally care for the futuristic stuff and there's minimal strategy here but it was a fun escape for 20 hours or so. $2-3 an hour isn't a bad deal to be entertained and that's not even including the multiplayer or the few times me and a friend have played zombies together. I imagine playing campaign with a friend would've been even more fun.Not too shabby like most everyone else I'm tired of all the futuristic stuff and hope they go back to WW2 or Vietnam or a current-day Middle Eastern theme but I don't regret buying or playing it.,3,Black Ops 3 is a game with a terrible single player. Medicore zombie mode i dont even know what to do what are rituals again?  A decent multiplayer however the experience is ruined by lag. Yh a 4 is what this game deserves.,4,At all it's an disappointing game and it's really frustating that the game changes almost nothing comparing to its predecessors.

I'll admit it's a factor but that doesn't earn the game an immediate 0. Let's start with the negatives that have been ignored in favor of the aforementioned or otherwise blindly glossed over. This game has the worst multiplayer servers in the series to the point that it's nearly unplayable. It's not unusual to be disconnected five times in a row. Host migrations almost always fail. Lobbies full of players but never start a match. Random and frequent lag spikes to 400 ping regardless of your connection speed. I once played ten minutes in game for what should have amounted to an hour. -2 for playability. The single-player campaign is also easily the worst in the series. It's obvious that they just included it because they had to. Nonsensical plot meaningless enemies nonexistant effort put into this at all. If you've ever tried to get into it I pity you. -2 for including this half-ass throwaway of a campaign. Now for the positives. This is the best Zombies experience there is on par with and built over the original experience in World at War. Diverse maps great gameplay complex mechanics that actually require some forethought and an interesting wrap up to the background storyline to boot. +2 for impressing me on this part of the game and -1 for deliberately putting the best parts of BO3 in $60 DLC. The multiplayer gameplay itself is surprisingly good too but the unreliability of the servers effectively cancel this out. The specialists and movement system keep things varied enough and the new game modes like Safeguard are more than welcome. Relatively balanced gunplay. All in all it's still fun with a friend and that's also the only reason I play it if only to pass the time waiting to find a real match. And yes -2 for being another COD game. Starting at an 8/10 is more than fair. We all know the series has been milked but compared to the immediate previous games in this series BO3 is definitely a standout title. I'd even say that I'd rather play this than MW3 or BO2 and I'd rank BO3 above either of them.,2,This game has good graphics and has cool costumes.

Same with the zombies mode it is just a blast! As for the campaign it may not be amazing like BO2 but still decent with a cool new entity villain. But the thing I really like about BO3 is that itś not just a generic military shooter like other CoD games. The gameplay and concept of BO3 brings something new to the table. Unlike most shooters it is bright colorful with unique and exotic maps. And BY FAR my favorite thing about BO3 is the specialist characters. Like seriously the specialist characters are absolute OGs that introduce a fresh clean new gameplay style to CoD. You really have to hand it to Treyarch for successfully finding a way to incorporate MoBA style badass playable characters with awesome abilities into a hardcore fast-paced FPS gameplay style. So don listen to all the bandwagon haters try this game out like I did and you will be very glad you did!,6,I found this game very boring.

The guns and maps are not too different from BO2 but it does introduce new mechanics such as the boost and slide.

When the enemy completely miss the target their target dies. I am constantly flipping from extreme positive to extreme negative KD. It makes the game incredibly frustrating and impossible to enjoy. I will never buy from Treyarch again.,8,Oki just finished the game.First of allthe campaign is far from bad.I will start from cons.First of allthe first thing i noticed is so bad voice acting of the main character.The voice is weirddulland at sometimes annoying.I don't know who gave the voicebut for meit is a very bad choice.I think that at this pointnobody likes these futuristic stuff.I meanokit is done goodtheOki just finished the game.First of allthe campaign is far from bad.I will start from cons.First of allthe first thing i noticed is so bad voice acting of the main character.The voice is weirddulland at sometimes annoying.I don't know who gave the voicebut for meit is a very bad choice.I think that at this pointnobody likes these futuristic stuff.I meanokit is done goodthe powers are fun and have great balance.But it's not fun for mei feel like controling a robot.First half of the game is nothing spectacularthe other half becomes interesting.Cons: Campaign overall is a good experience.Story is a bit different from other COD gamesbut it is something new.Campaign has some hard partswhich is good.I played it on hardenedand at some points i died for 78 times..Finally some challenge from COD campaign.The game runs really smooth on my ps4didn't have much problems on framerate.Locations in the mission are good.Local coop seems funi played it for about an hour with my brother and it's funnothing spectacularbut fun. Overalli think the game is not a dissapointmentcampaign is worth playingi don't know why so much hate.Oki also hate futuristic stuffit's not funbut the campaign was done ok..Nothing remainsjust to wait for COD to go back to present time or more backto WW.,8,Call of duty is a battle gun type game and has many games come out such as black ops 3 and infinite warfare etc.Call of duty infinite warfare is the newest cod (call of duty) and they have also remastered one of the old call of duty 4 (modern warfare)There has been many cods that have come out these are only a couple it was all about guns and on the ground combat but now it is allCall of duty is a battle gun type game and has many games come out such as black ops 3 and infinite warfare etc.Call of duty infinite warfare is the newest cod (call of duty) and they have also remastered one of the old call of duty 4 (modern warfare) There has been many cods that have come out these are only a couple it was all about guns and on the ground combat but now it is all about flying around and exo suits and that there is also call of duty zombies. This is all about getting to the highest round and the box that has all the guns in you spend coins that you collect in the rounds of the undead and spend them on the box to get the best guns like the ray gun or the thunder gun and they destroy anything in their path. There are loads of different titles there is black ops modern warfare ghosts infinite warfare advanced warfare and world at war.,7,I bought this game mostly for Zombies and I think they've done an excellent job with it.

It's story is absolutely subpar to even downright terrible the multiplayer is beyond screwed with unbalanced classes that seem initially diverse but hero stacking and a cacophony of problems like lag server crashes and connections make it even more so. I love zombies in COD (even if I admit that it can be the same old song and dance) but the one zombie map deal is too much insult to consumer integrity. Plus the map isn't even that good (as a long time zombie player for 6 years) and sits at a mediocre rating for me. A shame indeed because the DLC zombie maps are fantastic to play. As a game without its DLC it is easily a subpar COD game that argues that the COD formula is losing track and ready to derail at any moment.  At its best (with all DLC) it barely sits at a mixed mediocre score that makes it even more sad. I want to love the COD series alot but the series needs innovation and better time spent with its content to make the franchise good again.,9,Based on my time played I can say Treyarch out did themselves once again. The campaign is alright but the MP and Zombies is really where Treyarch like to show their talent. I give this a 9/10,4,In my mind Black Ops Franchise had to be ended in the first game and BO3 shows it. The game just have nice graphics and offers you many classes to play but it doesn't offers a lot of fun. The online mode has few players and this game became so Pay to Win since BO2. They got and add wall ride of titanfall warface's dash into the ground the gameplay of this game is a little confuse.In my mind Black Ops Franchise had to be ended in the first game and BO3 shows it.

It all boils down BO3 like BO2 isn't a good game if you are looking for fun I recommended you to play just the first game of BO franchise.,5,When you go into it for the zombies game mode but even that turns out to be disappointing. Really the worst in the otherwise fantastic black ops trilogy. The campaign story is boring uninventive and cliche. The wall running and jump boosting mechanics from the campaign don't work well with the small maps in the multiplayer mode.

At the start it's fluent and youHaving played over 500 hours on the game evenly divided in Zombies and Multiplayer and having 100% completion on Campaign and Zombies and then having 65% completion on Multiplayer I think I can safely say I'm an experienced player. The Campaign it's not the best I honestly think IW has the best campaign in any cod title ever but BO3 isn't bad either. At the start it's fluent and you get what's going on. I didn't start understanding why certain events unfolded the way they did until my 3rd playthrough (for challenges). The campaign is probably the main reason I'm dragging the score from a 10 to 9 Multiplayer It doesn't matter what gamemode I play what gun I grind or what challenge I go for I love the multiplayer. I'm a prestige master lvl 150-ish I have Dark Matter and all dlc weapons except for 5 of them (only bought cod points once and that was for a singular big box bundle it gave me a few weapons) but despite the game being fun for myself I could see why other's wouldn't like it. e.g. thrust jumping micro transactions also if one doesn't have any friends and plays solo the game is less enjoyable but still really fun to play. Zombies Treyarch are the masters of this gamemode All the maps in my honest opinion are amazing. I'm a prestige 10 nearly Master and I have all Easter Eggs done. Wether you like going for high rounds easter eggs or having fun with friends this gamemode is for you if you even remotely like the zombies genre. Overall the game is worth getting and grabbing the season pass along with it is just a benefit,8,A very enjoyable with one downside. The campaign can be fun but the story isn't very well thought out. It also has small glitches when playing it. The multiplayer is super fun though. They made so many fun modes and none are boring. The zombie mode is very interesting it is especially fun online. The gameplay and graphics are also good. I would easily recommend it even if the campaignA very enjoyable with one downside.

The realism of combat which the first two excelled at was totally lost with 3. Running across walls? Booster jet packs? I can't even.,6,The terrible storyline that I didn't understand and was **** the whole time and just was glad it's was over the co op crap was really not that good didn't care about the character they was really not interesting we didn't see any of the characters from Black ops 2 or something I really don't see the point o call this game black ops3 the multiplayer was good but the character inThe terrible storyline that I didn't understand and was **** the whole time and just was glad it's was over the co op crap was really not that good didn't care about the character they was really not interesting we didn't see any of the characters from Black ops 2 or something I really don't see the point o call this game black ops3 the multiplayer was good but the character in multiplayer was terrible ide hated it the gameplay was smooth the weapons was good but white the time the game got **** only thing that I liked was the zombies over 17 days on that **** glad they kept the storyline the four dlc was okay,6,Having not played any of the previous installments I enjoyed my first encounter with the franchise. The campaign was long enough and the zombies expansion a lot of fun but I can't bring myself to give the game a higher score due to the many crashes and freezes more than any other game I have played on the PS4.,8,confusing story i understand it but i dislike ...decent mp pretty good zombies and loads of content...however i dont like  perk system for zombies (prefer cards) game is called black ops but not hint of anything real in campaign ...mind trips are not black ops really .anyway  more than decent fps. i give 8,6,Black Ops III delivers an interesting yet convoluted single player campaign and an impressive amount of content relative to its predecessors. However it does little to reinvent the CoD formula beside MP characterization and a few refreshing abilities which operate too similarly. Much of what usually plagues CoD MP persists like inconsistent hit detection and unimaginative structurallyBlack Ops III delivers an interesting yet convoluted single player campaign and an impressive amount of content relative to its predecessors. However it does little to reinvent the CoD formula beside MP characterization and a few refreshing abilities which operate too similarly. Much of what usually plagues CoD MP persists like inconsistent hit detection and unimaginative structurally identical maps. However its pace has been accelerated in contrast to earlier boots-on-the-ground entries to an extent I find a bit too rapid but one which may sit well with many players. Zombies retains its grim atmosphere while injecting variation in its setting and characters. An overall enjoyable experience but one that feels too banal despite its few additions.,2,I do not know how but I let my friends take me to buy the call of duty and play with them online I never played a cod since last generation I had the wii. This video game is good but when you look at the saga the company and above all the community sucks.A campaign mode that gives pity play the first missions and then gave me the vomit. No depth or interesting argument.An onlineI do not know how but I let my friends take me to buy the call of duty and play with them online I never played a cod since last generation I had the wii.

In addition to repeating the same formula that has been doing Activision for a decade.The only redeemable is the mode of the zombies that is the only thing that can convince you to buy the game.In conclusion the video game is the same old **** The only one who could understand that buy this videogame is someone who has never played a cod.,9,İlk olarak oyunun hikayet kısmı pek tatmin edici değil fakat multiplayer kısmı efsane bir oyun var karşınızda vuruş hissi aşırı iyi neredeyse hiç bir oyunda yok level atladıkça silah açılması yeni parçalar açılması uzun süre oynamanızı sağlıyor haritaları içinse %85'i güzel haritaların yeni çıkıcak ww2 yi alcagınıza bunu önerirrim,10,Oh. my. god. I am serious when I say that everyone who gave this game a score like 0 or 1 should kill themselves and that they are just jelous because i probably noscoped them a bunch of times.......lol,9,I loved this game at launch! I am not the typical COD guy much prefer TF but this is a good game to come back to! My only issue is the D-heads you ending playing with sometimes. Also seems that some players have  advantage based on ping but until the world is cover in Fiber op I guess deal? Better than COD Advanced WarF.,3,This is the worst game I've seen! Graphics are terrible! System requirements are high! The gameplay is boring! The plot is a typical evil evil enemies and you're a super soldier! Mouse lag! Summary do not buy this game!,8,It may not hit it for fans of the Call of Duty franchise but if you truly think about the more newer games without the CoD title you might just find this game a great fun and exciting game to that you will enjoy,0,The game is a first person shooter game.

The rating of this game is mature. It might be a scary game if young people play this game. Most of the time in the game you have to shoot the bad people in the game.

Game play is bad but the multiplayer is fun and it makes this game redeemable. Guns and Weapons really haven't changed much and I wish they did something new with them. Score 6/10Decent,10,Black Ops III is one of my favorite call of duty games.  To start the multiplayer is amazing and I love choosing the different characters and playing with the special abilities (kind of an overwatch and COD mix).  This was the first game I ever got to master prestige.  I loved playing Search and Destroy and Domination in this COD and I loved the different maps especially Hollywood.

Además la pantalla partida tiene menos fluidez que el BO1 de 360 y texturas se quedan en blanco y no aparecen en tu cara. Increíble que esto haya salido así. Por otra parte tiene una cantidad brutal de contenido al César lo que es del César horas y horas que agradezco por eso no se come un 0.,0,Bought this game played it for 40 minutes and went back to the store to try to get my money back....,
