Call of Duty,positive,combat,8,And here I thought Soma will be the only game this year that would make me use my brain. I was dead wrong. This game's solo campaign was better than Call of Duty has any right to be.I'll admit right away that I like the solo campaigns of this series
Call of Duty,positive,combat,10,Giving it a 10 to even out the unfavourable reviews
Call of Duty,negative,combat,0,Memory leak. Uses all 16 GB of RAM in less than a few hours play Frequent crashesVRAM being maxed out
Call of Duty,negative,combat,0,What a garbage game. Has game breaking glitches that will drive you insane when you have to reload the game over and over again. They did update the graphics slightly but everything else including the general story is almost identical. Boring as hell too. I played 2 hours of the campaign and had to shut it off because I couldn't control my yawning. This is probably the worst call of duty IWhat a garbage game.

Call of Duty,positive,combat,9,The best Call of Duty since Modern Warfare 2. Maps in MP are based on Walking not on Boosting so much so this feels kinda old-school. Treyarch absolutely made a full packed and good Call of Duty. The two Campaign's
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,What can i say: just freaking awesome game  after 8 hours i finally finished and it was worth every minute spent on it. Pros 1. PC Port 10/10 there are no camera problems
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,Wonderful action game. Really makes an impression on me every time i play it.
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,0,Overhyped

Call of Duty,positive,combat,8,Having spent thousands of hours of my life on Multiplayer in various Call of Duty games (and other shooters) this is by far the best combat game
Call of Duty,positive,combat,9,Black Ops are the only CoD's we play these days due to being the only one with dedicated servers and graphics options you just come to expect on PC e.g. 120fov and not 65fov on MW3 lol. Hundreds of hours in previous Black Ops and currently 110hours BO3 so far which is pretty decent for a very casual gamer these days :DIt's just a fun game to play
Overwatch,positive,gameplay,10,Overwatch is a Objective/Hero based FPS game created by Blizzard Entertainment that takes an approach to the heavily saturated genre of FPS in a similar fashion to team fortress. The look
Overwatch,positive,gameplay,0,There's a good game buried in Overwatch
Call of Duty,negative,combat,1,"I love Black Ops II and I played too much time but III so bad don't buy.CoD BO II was good game. But this? Boring with ""excelent"" optimization. And it is really ugly game"
Call of Duty,neutral,combat,6,Jako fan COD'a
Devil may Cry,neutral,action,5,Okey
Devil may Cry,neutral,action,4,The game is good but it's created 100% for consoles. 
Devil may Cry,neutral,action,5,Solid game
Devil may Cry,neutral,action,4,This one's a doozie
Devil may Cry,negative,action,4,not sure what the critics are smoking. The worst aspect of this game is the fact that it is just plain boring. DMC is and always should be fun
Devil may Cry,neutral,action,3,Horrible. ruined the game.  its far to easy
Overwatch,positive,gameplay,10,DONT BELIEVE the 0 reviews. The game is not a clone of Team Fortress 2. It is actually fun and casual but can become more advanced as you play in higher tier levels. Most people giving it 0 did not level up past 10 where the characters and game gets more challenging. You get unlocks later as you level up and the game is fun for quick games of strategy. Their is no deathmatch since theirDONT BELIEVE the 0 reviews. The game is not a clone of Team Fortress 2. It is actually fun and casual but can become more advanced as you play in higher tier levels.

Overwatch,positive,gameplay,10,Fun and Fast-paced. Blizzard has created a Team based shooter to rival TF2 in how much fun it is. Never have I been this captivated by a shooter in a long time. A must buy if you are a fan of shooters and a fan of good games. Looking forward to the free updates this game will bring. Well done Blizzards
Devil may Cry,positive,action,7,It's definitely DMC game play  the level designs are fantastic
Call of Duty,positive,combat,9,User Score 2.7? Really... This is what we've come to on Metacritic??  OK I think it's officially time for metacritic to get rid of the User Reviews.  It shows how stupid we've become as a society...
Call of Duty,positive,combat,10,Great port. Well optimized (95%+ GPU usage on both my graphics cards
Call of Duty,negative,combat,7,awesome but I have no sound? :D great story missed with awesome and fun zombies and multiplayer.  Black Ops III presents the most ambitious campaign yet.
Call of Duty,positive,combat,9,The best Call of duty that I played.Nice multiplayer.Nice Zombies.Nice graphic.Great port.and new modes such as nightmare and free run and with the modding tools coming next time it will be even better.Good Job Treyarch
Call of Duty,positive,combat,10,Best Call of Duty ever

Overwatch,positive,gameplay,5,Overwatch isn't a horrible game
Overwatch,positive,gameplay,4,This is a good game
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,Devil may cry 4 was a HUGE flop
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,This is my first DMC game so I had no previous opinion of the series. The game was amazing fun
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,I love the game. I hated the previous DmC games for being too steep.. no story just brainless hack-and-slash.This DmC has the Darksiders feeling and it feels really special. I never liked the Asian style of the last DmC games.
Overwatch,neutral,gameplay,0,Nope... Not worse
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,This game is fantastic. I thought they did an excellent job showing us a young Dante. I'm 26 and I've played every DMC game from start to finish. I don't understand the hate for this game at all. The action is cool
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,This game is awnsome This game is awnsome This game is awnsome This game is awnsomereally good story
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,Such a glorious deconstruction of stale overrated franchise for tasteless weaboos! Magnificent masterpiece
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,0,Literally a dumbed down team fortress rip off. Way too easy to spot and hit people. Clearly made to cater console kids. What a joke from makers of warcraft
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,0,What happened to Blizzard? It's all style over substance now. It's really mind-boggling how one of the best devs ever became one of the most monumentally stupid ones. Never buying another Blizzard game.
Devil may Cry,positive,action,10,Awesome game with very fluid combat
Call of Duty,positive,combat,10,Best cod with cod4
Call of Duty,negative,combat,0,Another bad CoD.....where is my vomit bag?....ok It's not any better looking
Call of Duty,negative,combat,1,The most big ridiculous ending game never seen.... Bad Performance
Overwatch,neutral,gameplay,10,Overwatch is an astonishing triumph for Blizz
Overwatch,neutral,gameplay,0,I bought this game super hyped for it but this game literately has 2 super boring game modes that get old after a couple of hours. Honestly this game has the content of a FTP game like seriously league and dota have more content than this game that you have to pay $40 for....
Overwatch,neutral,gameplay,0,Are you looking for a game where you will make a difference? Where you will contribute to a 6 man team and feel a sense of accomplishment? Then find something different to play. This game is nothing but toxic players
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,0,Polished garbage.  Game has no balance to speak of and continues to get worse each patch.  New heroes are released at a snail's pace.  Maps are completely unbalanced.  Patches are always focused on profit over player enjoyment.  Developers have zero game sense.  No story
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,7,Team Fortress : Waifus edition. To be fair:  It is an entertaining game but I miss a lot of story and lore of the charachters. the game should have been free...like LOL
