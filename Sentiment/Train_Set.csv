alimudar,positive,10,Overwatch is a real treat! Blizzard has successfully made a perfect hybrid of an RPG and a FPS.. This game reminds me of the Counter Strike 1.6 days. This one is going to be with you for a long long time..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NewMenace,positive,7,Played it a lot during the closed and open beta , its a good game but not worth of the 40/60/120 $ price tag.This game brings no innovation to the FPS scene its just a mix a of TF2 and UT.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouMark_,positive,8,"Overwatch is very very fun to play. Athough it looks like a game that is fun to play I am not a fan of the ""fan service"" looking females what so ever but that does not effect my score.

The hit detection is extremely accurate and the players are Well balanced. People will complain that there are heroes that are OP and to them I say Your best Hero is OP for a reason. Heroes are good at what they do. The CONS are, Simple. No campaign equals one point off. Nowadays I would expect EVERY game to have at least some kind of single player experience with action that is Separate from robots and Multiplayer. You still have to count the things that they didn't fix yet on this list as well, Like the repetitive game modes and maps. Soon they will add more and more, but reviews has to be done now. Also, Micro-transactions. Yes they are definitely in the game. Just not forcing you to buy them of course. But I think its a major draw back do to the fact that this game is Built around customizing and strategy. So for me its a 8 on pc and 7 on console. Its $40 on PC but $60 on console?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clarion,negative,2,"Just another generic team FPS that really brings nothing new to the genre. Add microtransactions over an already full priced game and you have a powerful cash machine.

Maxson,positive,8,Definitely one of the best shooters this year. This game is really fun, especially with friends. It's nice to see Blizzard trying out new things, instead of sticking with their traditional games. I'm looking at the negative reviews right now, clearly some people just love to troll and hate for no reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LukeGuss,positive,10,Overwatch is the most polished multiplayer video game I've ever played on.

Joe614,positive,9,This is one of the best multiplayer first person shooters that I have played in years! The game is similar to TF2 . But this game kills TF2.

Another thing that bother me is the ""lore"" factor of the game. Blizzard created interesting characters and lore that don't related at all with how the game plays! It feels very forced to say that the Overwatch team was needed in a war crisis against robots and they stood by humanity security", but now they just shoot themselves off. If there was at least a small single player campaign ,  maybe, all this released you tube videos would make sense," and then I would agree with the MP being a ""free for all"," no lore sense"" of the game. But its not fair to with costumers to released a couple of videos and say it has a rich lore and at the same time the game itself its a full price shallow experience. This is incomplete F2P game with a full price tag (and in-game store) just because it can", since its a Blizzard game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeanNovelli,negative,0,Simple and not in a good way, there are no unlocks or a progression system.

AuldWolf,negative,0,I really don't like how it objectifies women to bring in skeevy perverts who brag about their in-game 'waifus.'

Also, there's a questionably unethical undercurrent in how every one of the women has this idiotic, asinine, childish backstory about how they didn't age. Cryogenically frozen! Stuck in a time vortex! Injected with Captain America drugs! You will facepalm every time. Every. Single. Time. (These aren't spoilers, they exist in the lore outside of the game.) Being an ethical person who cares about equal representation rights, I'd ask where the objectified men and older women are. They're not there. There are lots of games out there with a much more genuinely diverse cast of characters, and without all of this skeevy sexism intended to result in porn. Did you know that major porn sites had to block 'Overwatch' searches and uploads because it was getting out of hand? It was all over the gaming news because it pretty much exemplifies what Overwatch is about. It's a skeevy porn game. And the game is designed to be as comforting and as easy as possible to reach as many perverts as possible. It's overly easy, slow paced, and nothing about it requires any skill whatsoever. It's basically what would happen if Candy Crush Saga and Team Fortress 2 had a kid, and then that kid was raised by a skeevy uncle with regressive views about women. That's exactly what it is. And with the tiny amount of content present and how lazily designed it all is, it just felt like a rip off to me. There are just better experiences out there. Games more deserving of your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the tricks to getting into Overwatch is learning how to use multiple character. This game isn't about getting kills; it's about playing the objective, and learning how to us character's secret abilities to your advantage. Because of the focus on objective game types, I think the overall experience is much more friendly to people new to FPS's. However, there are still a few areas this game needs to improve in. The game suffers from some really strange hit box mechanics that need to be fixed before any competitive play is introduced. Second, there are very little consequences for teammates that quit. If someone on your team quits you should probably just expect to lose. This needs to be fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had assumed that there would be a strong anti-cheat built in on launch, because in beta there was no way to deal with hackers.  Not the case. Unless you enjoy playing with hackers, do not buy Overwatch.

askeptic,negative,2,"The tag ""Blizzard"" and the extreme marketing campaign are tricking Gamer's of all types in to purchasing this unfinished potential.

Overwatch", a game that should currently be F2P, is leveraging its Blizzard name to sell. The game features 21 unique Heroes, which is the only Pro to the game. Between poor level design, normal game modes with no team death match, no support for current PC hardware, and extremely low replay ability, this game falls flat. After playing for over 10 hours, it is inherent that this game is missing so many features, settings, options, modes that would be normally found in any other current release title in regards to FPS. It takes a whole 10 min to see everything this game has to offer, and begin questioning while you are still playing. The Gamer community has left feedback since the first day of the Beta, in which Blizzard has completely ignored and/or created excuses for. An example is 21:9 support. A widely popular request, as it can be found in almost all other titles from 2015 forward. Blizzard says they do not have the time to add it to the game due to artistic work needing to be completed. However, they do have time to run a real expensive marketing campaign that ranges between comics, full motion videos, banners, and all sorts of other items that take away from the artists time. Furthermore," this 21:9 feature can be forced in to the game via a very simple ""hack""", which is solid proof that this feature can be supported very easily as it works flawlessly. Yet, Blizzard fails to respond to the community with anything that can be considered proper response. Secondly, the tick rate at which this game runs. It runs at 1/3 of what the MINIMUM should be in an FPS. Long story short, this makes your aiming inaccurate and destroys the entire concept of an online FPS. Nothing like being shot as you run around corners. Cheaters? Yep, Blizzard has no answer to those guys yet. While there will be cheaters in every game, they are running rampant in the games where nothing is being done, aka Overwatch. Lastly, micro-transactions. Something Blizzard kept quite on until launch (shady). While micro-transactions don't ruin this game, still kinda lame how you must pay more to get what you need, otherwise it is random. Remind me again as to what that initial payment went to? Tl:Dr - avoid this game like the plauge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reactor244,negative,2,If you enjoy dying over and over again to other players who obviously aren't anymore skilled than you... Overwatch is for you. The abilities each character possesses is overpowered. You will be rained on with spam since there is no ammo to worry about, just reloading.

There are currently 21 characters in Overwatch, and the most effective teams use at most 3 of these characters at a time. Public matches will be filled with teams full of 6 of the same character and specifically the heroes that edge out at the top of the overpowered list. Characters without self-healing fall behind those that do. Watch streams of the best players. They die constantly. Skill in Overwatch is 100% negligible. Prove it to yourself. If you're a casual FPS player this game will entertain you for the time you have to play video games, granted you aren't put against people who live on this exaggerated MOBA FPS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I compare it to the infinitely superior Wii U exclusive Splatoon, I find myself taken aback at just how much better Splatoon is than this trash. I have other a thousand hours in Splatoon compared to my handful in OverWatch, and I honestly would much rather return to Splatoon for another thousand before popping this game in ever again. That's the difference in quality we are talking about here. I am not trying to hype up Splatoon, here. I am here merely to offer my experiences with Overwatch and how I find, in my opinion, that it is a waste of time. There are so many better games out there... why bother with this one? Because it's brand new? Please. By that logic, Uncharted 4 would be the best game ever made, even though the recent Tomb Raider reboot was a superior experience in every way. So what about Overwatch makes me so upset? There are too many examples to list, really, so I think I will just sum up: It's just not fun. That's it. That's all I have to say about this title in particular because that's all I need to say. The game is just not fun. There is not enough time in your life to waste talking about or playing bad games. It's time for us to move on, forget about Overwatch, and play some more Splatoon. Who is with me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feb  3, 2017,M_Ridcully,0,Absolute garbage. What's the point of having 23 characters when the same broken OP ones get picked every game? And Blizzard couldn't design a matchmaker to save their lives. Between this, Starcraft 2 and their recent efforts in WoW, it's obvious they really don't belong in the business of making PVP games anymore.

I believe Team Fortress 2 was 20 dollars by itself when it came out and it was 50 in the orange box bundle that came with Half Life 2 and Portal 2, but you actually owned those games and didn't need to connect to any servers to play the game. You can't even access your settings if you're not connected to the internet. I don't see what justifies Overwatch's price. It hardly has any content at all and the content that it has is flawed. It should honestly be about 20 dollars like Team Fortress 2 was. The add special gamemodes like Lucio ball(basically soccer) and Junkensteins Revenge(AN ACTUAL HORDE MODE THAT PEOPLE WANTED) which were actually unique gamemodes....for a few weeks...and they're never seen again. Why do this? They also have a feature where you can buy loot boxes to unlock cosmetic items, while including the feature to find them via leveling up, which is a total grind fest and you get sprays and voice lines out of them 90% of the time. The feature to find cosmetics via leveling is completely redundant when it takes about an hour to level up once if you're doing decent, and not all of us have the time to sit and play for longer than two hours every single day. Ranked is very poorly designed. The way ranked works is if your team wins, you go up in rank. If you lose, you go down. And win streaks and loss streaks effect how much you earn and lose. This seems well designed, but then you realize you need to rely on 5 other people to cooperate with you. This doesn't happen very often and people just want to argue or not cooperate at all. Players also like to blame each other and refuse to switch heroes when they aren't working out well. A bastion player will die because he's completely immobile and blame his team, or a Widow/Hanzo will never kill anybody because of a massive rein shield or their Winston keeps jumping them, and then they blame their healers or even the whole team when they were the ones in a bad position as bad heroes for the situation. These players end up leaving eventually in the middle of the game, and then the enemy team ends up with a man advantage and the game becomes even more one sided because backfilling isn't allowed in ranked. Quickplay is almost exactly identical," but doesn't involve ranks. There's also the added benefit of being roasted by your team whenever you ask them to switch or to simply stand behind your Reinhardt shield(so they don't die) because ""bruh it's just quickplay""", which is just excuse to perform poorly. And then there's arcade mode which is horridly unbalanced and only exists to make it look like there's more content, but it's literally just quickplay with randomizer, except for the 3v3 mode. I'll admit that 3v3 is pretty fun at times, but that's only when you have a friend or land with somebody who cooperates, which isn't often because arcade mode is a barren wasteland and it takes 5 minutes just to find a game. The special capture the flag game mode right now is absolutely broken and ends in a draw about 90% of the time it seems unless the enemy team is stacked with people in a group, which is honestly the only way to really have fun or win consistently in this game. The only good thing I really like about the game is some of the characters themselves. The characters have a lot of personality and different skills to make each one unique, but some, while not broken, are not enjoyable to play against. Mei and Symmetra are the biggest offenders of this(And D.va before the January patch). Mei is capable of placing down an ice wall which can separate players from their team so they get singled out by the team. It's very hard to overcome this on certain maps without a cooperating team, which you usually won't have. On top of that, her gun slows and freezes enemies which sets up for an instant kill on most heroes. She's typically called one of the best one on one heroes in the game just because of this, only really beaten by Mccree. On top of that, you have Symmetra who can easily 1v1 most flanking characters that could potentially deal with Mei, as Symmetra has a lock on weapon that melts most heroes like ice cream and has a surprisingly long range that can reach you while you're on the other side of a truck after it's already locked onto you. You have to severely outplay the Symmetra if you get caught by surprise as most of the heroes in the game. These characters aren't necessarily overpowered. Symmetra isn't that good in fact, but they're still not fun to play against and they'll win a 1v1 fight in most cases just because you didn't see them first. The game lacks content, has bad matchmaking flaws, and toxic players. The game can be fun with friends, but it's just very bare bones and below average for a 40 dollar price, or $60 for some reskins.

SlackIsBack,negative,1,Cheap class-based team game that tries to be TF2 with less depth. Matchmaking is by far the worst aspect of this game with the way it constantly places you with people vastly below or above your skill level.

During those times, do you still remember joining random servers on and on and on, hoping to find some equally skilled players to play with and have some fun? Yeah," me too. Good times. But... you also remember joining those servers where you got absolutely bulldozed by a seemingly ""too"" coordinated tight-knit group of players. What was their advantage", you were thinking back then? Were they using a program like Team Speak? Maybe they were a group of friends playing together in the same room? Or maybe they only played this one map for hundreds of hours, using the same general tactics and you just stumbled on their server. Or maybe all of the above. I remember I had a choice back then, I remember being able to choose for myself that I didn't like playing with these players, because there was no fun to be had for me. I couldn't hone my skills or perfect my tactics by observing them make the same moves every round, with the same weapons, with the same classes, in the same order, every single time. There was nothing te be gained on these servers. At those moments, I didn't realise the luxury I had of simply exiting those games and joining another within 10 seconds. This game takes away that basic luxury. As mentioned before by other reviewers here, this game forces you into games where the end goal is to have everyone maintain a 50% win rate. Sounds good on paper," right? Everyone has a 1 in 2 chance to win the game. Sounds logical. You win some and you lose some. But read that sentence again:  ""the end goal is to have everyone maintain a 50% win rate"".What this game does", it will disregard your personal and in game skill level and forcefully match you against players who are overwhelmingly more skilled than you," or match you up against a a seemingly ""too"" coordinated tight-knit group of players (which is visually indicated in your game) when you're on a winning streak. You feel that cold chill yet? Yes", this game willfully puts you in a meat grinder against individual top-tier players with hundreds of playing hours or clans of 3,4, 5 or 6 players," because the game deems it is now ""time"" for them to win their next game. You are the sacrifice in achieving that goal. There's no way out of this circle. If you make the choice to exit this game"," you will get a ""leaver penalty"" if you repeatedly keep leaving these kinds of games. When you join a new game"," you will (again) get matched up against similar overwhelming odds. Until it's your ""time"" again to win and get matched up against a random group of lower skilled players. It's maddening to play this game where the odds of you winning or losing are calculated and manipulated beforehand. In the end", you feel like you don't have any control on the outcome of the match. In closing, this game fills me with an almost unbearable sorrow. From afar, the production values of this game are sky high. Excellent art style, good sound design, interesting characters/class mechanics, stable engine, etc. Yet their choice to not let you choose your own servers and the inclusion of this fixed matchmaking will be the reason many gamers will leave behind this game. When Overwatch someday decides to give players the freedom to play with similar skilled players, you can up the score of this game to a 7.5 out of 10. There are fun times to be had, on the very rare occasion 2 teams of equal skill do get matched up against each other. P.S.: Oh," and ""Quick Play"" in this game means waiting up to 3 minutes to start/find a game with other players. Remember 2 weeks ago it was publicized there are 25 million registered players in this game. Even if you look at that number from an extremely pessimistic view and guess that about 1 in 250 registered players still plays this game", you still would have 100 000 active players. It should not take 3 minutes to find you a game with those numbers of people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peter_Weetsa,negative,0,            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game was one of the worst parts of the year 2016. It is thoroughly un-fun in every way imaginable. The characters are unbalanced and uncreative. The whole premise of the game is basically a Team Fortress 2 clone. It is based entirely on team play, but there is no incentive for working together as a team, and no way to punish players who troll or do not work with their team. Overall, I have had a highly negative experience playing this game, which I have been playing since release. And I haven't even gotten to the worst feature yet: competitive play. I realize Blizzard changed competitive placements in Season 3 because Gold and Platinum were overpopulated, and they wanted to fix this. That said, the fixes they implemented were the worst possible. In Season 2, I placed silver and stayed about the same throughout the season. However, I played a lot of quick play and other modes between Season 2 and Season 3 and improved quite a bit. When I played my Season 3 placements, I won 7 out of my 10 placements, earning 3 or more gold medals in every game except for one. Obviously, this means I not only won games, but significantly contributed to the success of my team. Additionally, I was matched in every game against people who had already placed in gold or in platinum. The fact that I did well against these players shows that I deserve to be placed in a similar skill level to them. However, I was placed in bronze. I feel the changes that Blizzard made to competitive essentially just places every player lower than they deserve to be because they could not think of an actual solution to the problem. This removes all motivation to play competitive, because good players are going to be placed lower than they should be, which feels bad and is not a reward for playing well. Additionally, it is going to be much harder to climb to where you really deserve to be because you will be placed with people who are not as skilled as you are. This also creates much more unbalanced matchmaking. Overall, I feel this game is not very creative or fun, and the little potential it did have was completely ruined by the utter stupidity of Blizzard as a company. I would NEVER recommend this game to anyone, and it has certainly been a waste of my time and money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overwatch is basically that," but switch the ""running out of mana"" part for ultimate abilities that take zero skill to use effectively and may turn the tide of a match. It may be fun for a while but the gameplay is broken and simply doesn't have what it takes to build a decent competitive scene.

It steals mechanics and features from a bunch of places such as: The gameplay of TF2, the MoBA mechanics of League of Legends, and the graphics of Disney Studios (?!). TF2 is easily one of my favorite games. It is amazing and I simply love it to bits. However, Overwatch is just a poorly made ripoff of TF2, and not nearly as good. I have so many complaints about this garbage game, I don't know where to start. First off, it has practically NO CONTENT. 3 gamemodes, and like 4 maps. That is simply pathetic. It tries to be funny or humorous by having a goofy stereotypical British character that says cringe stuff like," ""CHEERS LOVE! THE CAVALRY'S HERE!"" Absolute fail. And the price?! REALLY?! $60?! What a load of bullcrap. I actually thought that was a joke at first", but apparently Blizzard DOES want to overprice this stupid trash game. So overall, Overwatch is simply a disgrace to both the FPS genre and the otherwise awesome array of Blizzard games, which is strange, since they're the one who made it. Just do yourself a favor, go play TF2 for free instead of wasting $60 on this obsolete garbage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ive just been in a game where the whole team were Russian and began to rage and moan and insult each other because no one could work together. Every game is like this. You have one really good game with a group and then have high hopes for the next game and then get in a game like that. Gaming isnt fun anymore. Its all full of these obnoxious children thinking they're a god and can rule over everyone in the lobby. The game its self is good but the community behind it is awful. If you're thinking about getting this game. I would highly avoid it as you will be disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C100,negative,2,God I wish I'd checked the reviews before buying this. After having played the game for some time, desperately wanting to like it, the best thing I can liken it to is an abusive relationship. Sure you'll have fun.

After having played the game for some time, desperately wanting to like it, the best thing I can liken it to is an abusive relationship. Sure you'll have fun. The characters are all fun and cute- through no small part of the cinematic shorts (which are free btw). When the game's at its best you've got a quirky yet high intensity class based shooter with a role for pretty much everyone. The introduction of new heroes is tied nicely into the stories they create and everything generally works. But when you actually spend time with it, good god can it be just an awful experience. As many people have said this is one of the worst gaming communities to date, and as you fall in rank people are only going to get worse. There are some awful examples of design, such as if your team has a leaver- all of your team will lose SR as a result, you can be matched against a 5-stack as a solo player, and some heroes are objectively better than others. There are very few matches that you'll win by a slim margin: 90% of games are going to be total wipes one way or another despite your best efforts. The worst part is that because the game is so intensely focused on the teamwork, one loose thread can throw the entire game off. While sometimes it won't be anybody's fault (often it will be though) something won't mesh in your team- whether nobody can play a hitscan to counter a flying character (of whom is massively unbalanced at lower levels) or whether nobody wants to switch despite being countered, or whether simply your chosen heroes just won't mesh together- this can end a game and all the way up to around mid-plat (over the threshold of half the playerbase)   people won't have the skill or experience to be able to play the amount of heroes necessary with the correct degree of teamwork. It's not fun, as often matches are simply decided by the roll of the matchmaker. The exception to this is anybody diamond rank or above as more people will willingly change and adapt to help the teamwork, but this only accounts for about 10-20% of the player base. A lot of these problems would be at least bearable if there was some sort of fix on the horizon, but Blizzard haven't even sought to address the blatant and easy fix of having a leaver ruin the entire team's fortunes- let alone anything that would require more thought. There's also the gripe of the game not actually having that much content for a fully priced game. While you can easily make up the hours (trying to convince yourself it's worth it), it gets very stale, very quickly as there are currently a total of 4 main game modes, with 14 maps. With all the new game modes that've come out it might be considered worth it but these are removed at the end of each event, meaning that instead of keeping the events in the game for some players to enjoy, Blizzard removes it meaning no-one gets to enjoy them. The game is also an online shooter- so the only single-player mode to speak of is playing with offline bots which is not reflective of the game at all as the bots will just stand around with only their aim tweaked to suffice for difficulty. While the online-only part is a fairly obvious part of the game, it just goes to remember that full-price games used to include both single player and online content. In short it's probably best if you don't buy Overwatch. I'll admit I was suckered in with the free weekend and the cutesy shorts, but at the end of the day the only thing you're getting is an online game that is constantly being fixed, which is at the mercy of its own community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have solo queued in League of Legends and DotA 2, and neither was half as painful an experience as this.

I am really not good at the game - I make no claim to that - but I often end up having to carry (3+ gold medals per game) teams with players hundreds, sometimes even a thousand levels above me. They are just worse. They've played  the game for thousands of hours and still have absolutely no grasp of the basics. The vast majority of players just auto-lock the one character they play, take the most direct route to the enemy and start shooting at the first enemy they see. They will fire at a shielded Zarya over an unguarded Mercy. It would make a lot of sense if most of them were bots, but then at least bots will actually play the objective. All this is surprising considering how simplified the game is compared to other similar games. There's no ammo, no fall damage, and very simple maps. Balance is just a paper-rock-scissors system of who counters who. It's a pretty shallow game, yet the average player is still managing to drown somehow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives differ but the combat does not, so it's just people moving a bit differently on different maps but apart from locations it barely matters. Compared to CS which also has pretty stale and simple maps," combined with similar ""just go and shoot"""," in that game you can actually feel like you have a bigger impact when you're doing well. In Overwatch (and HotS) even the biggest ""carry"" in a game cannot make huge impact. This is a design choice that sure can appeal to some people who are in there ""just for fun"""," but after a week of gameplay you just can't help but to uninstall the game due it's feeling of meaninglessness. I'm not big FPS fan anyway and Overwatch doesn't make the game any better. It actually makes it worse experience because you cannot really feel much improvement even if you manage to land every single shot on enemy. Healing / tanks / ultimates just are there to even up the skillgap in already watered down version of CS where individual shots barely count. This game has such a huge potential but I feel it's getting wasted by the ""optimism"" of the supposed critics giving this game far too much credit for what it really does", and it's ruined by the casual feeling. I tried playing the competitive mode and after the first 10 games or so I got placed too high because apparently I was supposed to have an impact on a game where 5 people are holding objective with Reignhart or whatever his name is blocking everyone from getting damaged while my teammates keep jumping forward into the huge enemy fire. This could be good game with well played team, but without a good single player experience you're not getting any recognition of doing well if you even can, because apparently there's hard counters to everything, so even if you'd manage to do well 1v1, some counter pick jumps on your back and slams you down. Compared to some modern shooters where you have 4-5 roles, they are basically all with their own good skillsets, but they are able to carry their own weight and not feel super underpowered in taking down enemy. In example Battlefield you got anti-tank units who can still take couple enemies down with rifle, but are mostly effective to blast those nasty tanks. Then you got medic who still is very effective on other areas but is able to give some healing and even resurrect. This is what good game design looks like. You got roles that aren't exactly anyones counters, but they manage to carry important roles in combat. In Overwatch this kind of team composition is thrown out completely and replaced with heroes who go counterpick whatever you may take: Snipers get owned by ninjas and shields, some assasins who are close range get owned by turrets and so on. It just feels like the game wasn't intended for any real fairness of 1v1 taken into mind, which caused this game to become a huge **** of people just blowing everyone down without any real coordination and team who ever manages to get versatile setup usually ends up winning due counterpick mechanics. Newer patches just added more counter picks and basically none of the real issues of rock paper scissors ideology weren't touched, making the game even less fun and more frustrating. Get a better design crew Blizzard!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe it will be full enough to be worth its price in 10 years. • The dev team is filtering the feedbacks and only answering to the complains they choose to aknowledge. For everything else, this is simply censoring. They play nice in videos where they say that the game belongs to he player base and thank you in messages, but that's where it stops when money's involved.• Their events are getting bigger each time and more impossible to complete either by playing or by paying.

The game is probably in the worst state it's ever been. Between new problems like Doomfist's instant kill, overbuffing Mercy and DVa, and longstanding problems like Pharmercy, Hanzo's scatter and certain characters just being perpetually OP (76) or UP (Sombra) with few or no changes, it seems like Blizzard doesn't have a clue what to do. Though given their history with Starcraft and WoW, I guess this should not come as a surprise. -Terrible matchmaker. It's been over a year and I'm still pretty sure this thing just enforces 50% win rate. Also in non-comp modes be prepared to get matched with players hundreds, often thousands of levels about you, because evidently there's not enough new players. - Waiting for game: be prepared to wait typically 2-6 times longer than the estimated time even during peak play times. Maybe there's just not that many people playing the game? I usually see the same 10 people over and over too, even after leaving at match's end. - Maps: You can't choose which map you want to play on, and even if you could, the majority of them are just slight variations on TF2's Dustbowl, with or without a payload. - Character variety: Have fun getting reported for playing an off-meta hero in Quickplay. Mystery Heroes sounds fun, but since there's no limits it generally comes down to whichever team gets 3 D.Va's or something FotM. Deathmatch seemed like a breath of fresh air, but you probably won't stand a chance unless you're using one of a handful of characters with low-skill instant kill moves (Doomfist's right click, Hanzo's Scattershot, McCree's flashbang). - Dumbs down a lot of typical FPS things for casuals: No fall damage, infinite ammo, very little self-damage, visible enemy health. Most heroes are very easy to use with low skill ceiling. - Press Q to Win: You can play like garbage on attack the entire game, but plenty of ults can easily kill most of the enemy team or simply force them off the point, making for an easy win. Add that all up with the repetitive feel of the game (In under a dozen hours, you will probably see just about everything the game has to offer), and I think giving it a 4/10 is still a little generous. Blizzard is slow to add content, and mostly we just get events with limited-time game modes and skins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I pre-ordered it, even, only based on the demo week we got to play it for free before release. Based on the hype and similarities to Team Fortress 2, I was expecting the game to be very similar to TF2 - more similar than it really is. Because it is not that similar to TF2 at all, and I'll likely never enjoy it as much and play it for as long as TF2. First off, gameplay - while at first it seemed very similar (hence I pre-ordered it), after several hours it became very evident that OW is lacking the depth and skill ceiling that have kept me hooked in TF2. 20% of gameplay time there I just practice movement and explosive jumps with the help of specifically community-crafted maps, mods, and community-hosted servers. Overwatch, on the other hand, just feels easy. There's nothing you can really practice for extended periods of time; in the end, when shooting is easy, movement is easy and gameplay is simple, all that's left to improve is gamesense and teamwork. And while that's definitely worth doing and certainly decides over victory or failure, I just prefer a game that also has that, on top of very challenging aim and movement mechanics giving it that much more depth - TF2. The other issue is how restrictive Blizzard is. No mods, no custom maps, you can't even host your own server or play OW offline. That sucks. And I mean, that really sucks. Half the fun in TF2 when I started out was to hop from insane community server to another one to see what crazy mods the community has thought of; WarioWare (with working minigames), Starfox (with working planes), Mario Kart (with working Karts), just to name a few that everyone can imagine what's going on. But there is way more, and the community was given limitless freedom to make whatever the heck they want. So we have a 30 vs 1 players boss battle mod, Dodgeball, Rocket Jump maps, Deathrun, Slenderman, and way," way more - not to mention regular but unofficial game modes such as capture the flag with only one flag. There was even one time where I joined a community server that just seemed like a ""trade"" server (lobby-type servers designed to investigate other people's loadouts", because TF2 has a ton of cosmetic items of which you can select three on your character, plus weapon skins), but it was kind of a disguise. By accident you could discover a hidden trap door, which led to other places, all of which required an entire team of characters working together to go from place to place, and it was an extremely long way almost at the map size limit filled with puzzles and explosive jump challenges. The most important part of the team was an Engineer building teleporters because not every required character is able to traverse the same ground as others. The final rooms required you to fight through a dungeon of AI controlled, respawning skeletons while blasting away at a massive door, which could finally be opened with the help of a Demoman shooting Grenades (like Junkrat) through a vent," opening a portal that led to - a Pony village from the current ""Friendship is Magic"" show. That was the final station. It was hilarious", and one heck of an experience. In short, TF2 is crazy diverse, and you can spend a month - if not months - not playing the same map, game mode, or even strategy twice. One might be thinking," ""why would I want to do all this? I just want to play the game"," I don't need mods."" and I agree. Overwatch is not a bad game", it is in fact quite an enjoyable one. Mods shouldn't be a requirement, and I know that not everyone cares about them. It's just that I, personally, am really disappointed with how Blizzard handled things. If you take a glance at StarCraft and WarCraft - the games that were so mod-friendly that DOTA exists purely because of those, along with the obvious inspiration for OW being TF2 - yet, Overwatch is completely locked behind Blizzard's servers. It's a shame, really. I'm still playing TF2 after seven years," and it's almost like I was playing a very different game back then than I do now simply because I had different preferences for game modes. Overwatch got boring after two months. It feels like ""been there"," done that"". I could potentially just keep playing competitively to improve my game", but I already do that in TF2. And that's just the much richer game for me. Finally, I'm probably rating OW lower than it deserves (kinda). Its gameplay is decent, if it was only that, I'd give it a 7/10. But I actually HATE always-online games. I hate that there is zero possibility for mods and community stuff. OW is a poor example for a video game," because games can be much more that. Sorry. Another issue with OW is that it wasn't programmed very well. There's always noticeable input lag unless I play on extremely low settings due to a ""feature"" called ""1 frame interpolation"" or whatever. This means 300 fps or  bust.",,,,,,,,,,

Blizzard hasn't innovated for over a decade; Overwatch doesn't come close to changing that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mrmustard,negative,1,I want to like this game but I just can't. It's really no different to TF2, but costs money. To be honest it doesn't feel at all like a Blizzard game apart from the price tag. If you literally have nothing else to play then maybe it's OK. With the shooter standard so high these days I was very disappointed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Damtitus,negative,5,I bought Overwatch almost immediately after release, and at first it looked like a great game. (I played till April 2017, scoring high plat-low diamond in competitive, spending 300+ hours ingame.)

(I played till April 2017, scoring high plat-low diamond in competitive, spending 300+ hours ingame.) Very polished engine that runs decently even on old PC, flashy graphics, Blizzard's name & fame - all these promised top-tier multiplayer shooter for years to come.However," the reality was disappointing.- This is so called ""team"" game where you can not see your (or anyone's else) team-related performance. If something goes wrong", you can only make wild guesses. We have completely useless and misguiding medals instead," which tell nothing about teamplay or team contribution or team needs at current moment.- Blizzard promised great ""casual-competitive"" gameplay", but solo queue competitive is abysmal. Every third game is won or lost due to reasons-related-to-ONE-player (someone is a troll and decided to throw a game, someone is 4000-rating genji main in 3100 game and just eliminates opposing team, someone is unlucky to have crappy ISP and disconnects midgame, someone is that special person who plays ONLY Torb/Widow/Hanzo, etc," etc - you can't do anything in these cases to change the outcome). The only way would be to find your own 6-10-20 man team of similar skill & mindset; but that is completely opposite of ""casual"" - and required too much effort for majority of the players.- There is NO way to perma-mute trolling or harassing players. I was lucky enough never to meet really stinky trolls in game"," but once I was paired with ""widow only"" player 3 times in a row. This person admitted they are losing on purpose", so I reported/muted them - and I was still put into the same team 2 more times... Report system apparently don't work, and some players just insult everyone else, spoiling the mood a bit. They are never banned. As a result, there are trolls in every second game.- There are too few maps, and map design is mediocre at best. 2 of the maps have the sole entrance in the beginning, which is easily blocked - that makes both defense and offense quite boring and repetitive quite often. Number of game modes isn't great either.- Outside of the game, heroes are great - they have their own stories, agendas and characters. Ingame you do not feel of see ANY of that. Storywise, you don't understand why brutal killers from Talon are fighting on the same team, as their Overwatch adversaries, or why they are fighting at all. There is no  singly player mode at all, which is really sad for a game with such rich background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lots of special chargeups which are too effective at clearing out a capture point of enemies negating a solid defense. Most chargeups don't seem very difficult to play super effectively. Frankly, I am not really sure what separates a good player from a poor one in this game. It seems that hitting enemies and dealing massive damage is fairly direct and easy to do. There doesn't seem much in the way tactical opportunity given the map designs. Not a whole lot you can really do apart from mob with your teammates down a fairly narrow path and confront the enemy mob head on. I think the only aspects of this game which have merit are the art and code. The game is very attractive and delivers solid performance on old hardware. That said, gameplay-wise this game is a mess. I can only surmise that Blizzard bought the high reviews for this game. I honestly don't see how anyone could consider this game to be exceptional.

One should not have to beg, plead, hope, pray (etc...) that complete randoms will at least make an ATTEMPT to play this game the way it's creators meant it to be played. This game takes an INSANE amount of coordination to play, and it's simply not possible to expect that on any consistent basis. this game is full of great highs, and terrible lows. Nothing is more frustrating, when you try to communicate, everyone just does what they please, and you can just feel the match is over, just as it starts. Don't get me wrong, I am not the best player ever, in fact I am pretty pedestrian, but i think its reasonable to expect some type of competent play from others. Quick play mode seems like place to just mess around (that is what VS AI, or the practice range is for), and you would think that this would not be the case in ranked play, but it is. the current ranking system does not seem (in my opinion) to accurately reflect and or adjust for skill gap disparities, so its really hard to judge how good x player really is. My question is how can you expect to climb the ladder in solo que? I am a bronze player, (Silver season 2), and its like your stuck in SR heck. Its seems that all the levels are like this to an extent. It's also very misleading when you find a group that seems to play well, and you all group up together, and then get crushed because teams are so much more coordinated than what you thought your team was. Its seems that sometimes the only way you win is because the opposing team is just way worse than your already terrible team; its like a challenge of who can be the worst, instead of who can be the best. If you had 6 people that you know and trust that can play this game with any type of regularity, will not get salty when things go bad, and play for fun, and work as team win or loose, then i would say this game is for you. Otherwise, it will make you want to pull your hair out. I am such a blizzard fan, but the game is just so madding to play. Its so fun, but so stressful at the same time. I am just torn on weather i want to uninstall or not. The game's logic is flawed because people are flawed, and almost seems the game is doomed by it's own design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was just overall upset from the game after playing a few matches. I'm very disappointed that a huge team by the name of Blizzard could be easily beaten down by a team of almost 13. The awards it got at The Game Awards were screwy as heck, with Warframe winning the vote by taking more than two thirds of the pie chart, yet Overwatch winning due to straight up popularity. Then Blizzard treats all the players like children, and banned a competitive Torbjorn main, who was one of, if not, the best Torb main, that player being Fuey500. The soundtrack sounded boring, though fitting the style of characters a bit, just boring. And people say starting Warframe is a bit newbie-unfriendly.

However if you lose a handful of game in placements and wind up in gold or lower just give up on that competitive season if you solo queue like I do. I can't tell you how many times I join a game only to have a team full of idiots only pick damage characters... The game is next to unwinnable at that point if the other team has even half of a brain. There are tons of ways to fix this. They could implement a top 5 character selection when you start a queue and at least try to find some form of a balanced team composition for you to group with. Not only that," but you can queue up against anyone within +or- 1000 SR of yourself... this opens the door for better players to offer bad players a ""carry"" which means that they go in wreck all the kids that havent got a clue whats going on and boost the other account. There are even people making money off of this nonsense... At the end of the day Overwatch is a brilliant game with great characters and fun game play but because it so heavily relies on teamwork for you to stand a fighting chance it would be really nice if they took people who solo queue games into consideration. I'd be more than willing to wait 10 mins a match if it meant i'd have a team with the right composition. even an option between that and regular queue would be nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They completely randomize balance in the game, seemingly throwing a dart and spinning a wheel to see who gets nerfs and who gets a buff. They created this game with what seems an eSports focus (lots of stuff even happening in beta) but have done updates/balancing with casual play in mind. Im fine with either or, but it tries to play both sides of the field without doing a good job at either. I would honestly believe this game would be much better if they handed the rest of the development off to another company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MinehDerp,negative,4,I would like to say something before this review, I love the game, the animation, the game play, the characters, almost everything!

Though there is one major thing I find horrible is... The matchmaking, it is atrocious! You are constantly thrown in to games where the match is one sided, ending in your defeat. And worst of all, you can't get out of it! You just keep on losing and losing until you've practically smashed your computer with a hammer and thrown it off of a two-story building! Competitive is even worse! You'll get paired with the worst players on the planet, and then get bronze and be mocked for it. Some tips I have on countering the never ending losing streak, is to play vs. ai, or play custom games. playing vs ai can be assuring because you can actually win. And obviously custom games are just pure fun. Like I said, I love this game, but the horrible matchmaking has lead me to giving this game a 4/10 (also junkrat led me to this, he's op Jeff),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spydominator,negative,5,If I were to recommend this game at its launch date, I would honestly do it, but as it stands now I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy and I will explain below why with pros and cons: Pros:- If you wanted to play TF2 in the modern era, this game would be its successor.- Astonishing graphics with minimum requirements from your hardware- Unique character personalitiesIf I were to recommend this game at its launch date, I would honestly do it, but as it stands now I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy and I will explain below why with pros and cons: Pros: - If you wanted to play TF2 in the modern era, this game would be its successor.- Astonishing graphics with minimum requirements from your hardware- Unique character personalities that we can all identify with- Music and sound effects are top notch- Different ways to play the game, at least that's what they want us to believe Cons: -Balance is really out of control and it gets worse from patch to patch. Blizzard is unable to find a middle ground between overnerfing or overbuffing a hero, thus creating frustrations for months to come.- Lack of transparency between Blizzard and its community. No patch notes for most of their updates.They act like they care, but instead they do the opposite of what the community wants. Example : D.va had gone through so many changes, back and forth, that her role isn't even clear at this point. - Releases are really really rare. So far it's like 3 heroes per year, which compared to other games is not something to brag about. Events are not that often, you can count them with just one hand. - Balance changes and bug fixes take forever to happen.Example 1: Torbjorn's hammer was bugged, thus making him build and repairing turrets 25% slower, making him a pain to have on your team. Blizzard was aware of the bug, yet they fixed it after 3 months, 3 months in which Torbjorn was unplayable. Example 2: Widowmaker had been nerfed since launch for her quick scope and easy kills. It took Blizzard more than a year to even start repairing her issues. - Unless you have a group, it's extremely frustrating to play this game alone. The game focuses on 2 game modes: 1. Quickplay is oriented towards the casual scene where people can train and get the hang of new heroes. Problem is nobody is playing this mode as a team. Everyone chooses whatever they want to play with no regard to what the rest of the team needs to even have a chance of winning the game. Team cooperation is close to impossible, unless you've got a group which can easily cause you to regret playing the game. The matches are utterly either a stomp fest on you where the opposite team doesn't even let you touch the objective, or you're stomping the enemy team, thus making it unchallenging and boring for you. I've yet to see Quickplay matches actually fought on equal terms, it's always one team is superior to the other in most cases. It's the mostly the game's MMR that does a bad job at matching equally skilled players, whereas favoring how much a game is found for you, rather than the quality of it. 2. Competitive is meant to entertain the hardcore crowd, so you'd expect cooperation to be better than Quickplay. Well, yes and no. Most people do want to cooperate to win, but they literally force you to play whatever they want to make sure of it. Popular opinion is extremely influenced by the meta. If you're playing something out of the meta, they start being toxic towards you, before even getting a chance to show what you can do. This is literally the most toxic game that I've ever seen. - Game is getting more and more casual with each patch. Player skill is starting to count less and less, while the accessibility of easy kills with hero abilities is rising with each patch. Conclusion: As it stands right now, do not buy this game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overwatch is a take on the FPS genre create by Blizzard. It is meant to give a fast, exciting, and teamwork orientated environment. However, this review is on my experiences with the game, tossed in with very personal opinions. This 'rant' (you can say) is for a smaller and fresh audience to the fps genre (Like I am). This game has a learning curve that is not present with other non-fps games (Well, obviously, let me touch on it a bit more). If you are new on the fps genre, you are probably aren't aware of the most basic (And in my case, hard to learn) fundamentals of fps games. Checking your flanks, having steady aim, strafing, all while the game is so fast-paced, that you forget about it (or have difficulty, I was on a controller, I rather prefer keyboard). This can lead to other fps veterans to kill you on the spot with your predictable movements. Things like this can affect your mind, while getting frustrated on why it isn't working out. Another aspect I want to dig into is the mental strength you require. If you are starting this game as your first fps, you have a massive cliff to climb. While you struggle with the basics, you are, to say it bluntly, a very likely burden for your team. This leads to losing, which happens a lot when starting, possibly flattening your confidence. This can lead to negative emotions. Lastly, frustratingly playing the game with no visible enjoyment. Play this as your first FPS game can be like dealing with an annoying associate of yours. You can do so much, then before you know it, it can lead to a severely toxic atmosphere. This was me dealing with it myself (along with others playing the game). Overall, Overwatch is a game that was born from an idea from Blizzard. It can be a hard and frustrating experience. Don't get this wrong, at times it is a rather fun game; it is just very difficult to squeeze out its enjoy-ability in the over-competitive, skill-lacking mindset of people like me. I hope you get some great insight out of what I have wrote.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idk if blizzard can make a good anymore. D3 = total **** hearthstone = beyond garbage and WoW hasn't been fun since 70 launch. I honestly don't think blizzard could make the game any worse. Better than that half the time when I go to join a game it kicks me out and won't let me rejoin(the button breaks x'D) and I have to relaunch the **** game just to be able to rejoin and then after I do all that AND rejoin the game the server closes down and it gives me A **** LEAVE and I can't play for 30min. **** THIS GAME. It is BEYOND trash and wouldn't even be worth the time to play IF IT WAS FREE. I mean there are free to play shooters that are WAY better than this game. On top of that, I paid 200+ dollars(after buying a few loot boxes after launch) all WASTED. I've uninstalled that piece of **** and if I had a physical copy of the game I'd burn it. **** Blizzard **** Jeff Kaplan and **** whoever else ruined what could have been a fun game to play. Please do yourself a favor and spend your money and time elsewhere. Blizzard trying to make an esport out of this POS x'DDD who the **** wants to watch that?!

With horribly balanced heroes and maps that share the same make up, the game is basically boring. Say you wish to try your hand at competitive; maybe test your skills with people of similar talent? Well good luck. Overwatch  has a nasty habit of pairing you with other players that are multiple levels of prestige higher than you. Additionally, since the newest update, winning your ten games is equivalent to not even playing the game. Someone who wins 7 or 8 out of their games has the same chance of being ranked with players who have only won one. All-in-all, Overwatch is a poor excuse for an FPS with Blizzard once again trying to hop on the band wagon of popular game genres (I'm looking at you Heroes of the Storm) with basically what you could call a poor man's Team Fortress 2.

This game still enforces the 50% win/loss ratio even in competitive game types, so no matter how good you get or how much you practice you will NEVER feel like you are improving, just so that new or casual players can feel like they are getting somewhere and doing well. A better idea would be to ACTUALLY implement a matchmaking system that matches players based on skill and not win/loss ratio and who needs to win a round vs who needs to lose one, this game has lost me as a long time player which is sad because I love the game but the matchmaking is the one thing that just ruins it completely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The characters are all fun and the lore is interesting. However the game mechanics are very very very poor at closer inspection compared to other similar games such as TF2. Blizzard also has ""Not Invented Here Syndrome"". Blizzard keeps attempting various ideas which have been tried before decades ago and conclusively determined to be bad before discovering on their own an existing known best practise or design. The management is also quite bad. By the time you have 200 hours like I have you'll absolutely hate this game. This truly is a strategy game company's first attempt at making first-person shooter. They just do not ""get it"". One design idea Overwatch employs a lot is to make the each team responsible for their collective actions. Thus Overwatch is a game which doesn't care what ever you do in your team as an individual player. You could be the best guy to heal people", best guy to do frags, but ultimately that doesn't matter as you're not evaluated based on your individual performance. You get points by doing teamwork and the game only evaluates players how much and how well they do teamwork. Individuals aren't welcome. If one of the mates quits the game in your team, all players, including the opposing team, will have their points reduced. It's made to disincentive leaving during a match but it just makes not so fun game when you know you're forced to play a game you cannot win any longer and you've lost interest to. Overwatch also does player profiling where it attempts to place similarly playing individuals against each others. Do you play with people who often rage quit during a match or have done it yourself few times? Well, start expecting to see people who quit the match more often than not. Text chat a lot during game? Ok, you'll end up with people who chat a lot and don't concentrate on game. This is apparently a means to fight trolls. How about we throw 12 random individuals of various skill levels, nationalities, languages, experiences," etc. who don't know each other beforehand and don't communicate during a match? The result is just a disaster. This is a game for groups of friends not for individual players and you will constantly lose and lose and lose and lose until you find a group for yourself. Otherwise there is going to be always that one guy who doesn't get the pacing of the team and blames everyone for the problems of the team except himself or herself and doesn't concentrate on improving the team. Also the people who ""main"" certain characters a garage who need to quit Overwatch as they've not understood the game at all. Having just any group also won't do. It needs to be a group that has trust inside it and ability to know each character inside and out to be able to improve the group's collectivist skill cap and to support your team. That is an impossible equation. By the way the community in Overwatch is cancer and Blizzard is feeding them. Blizzard for example banned certain words from chat because according to the community ""hurt feeling"" of people which was just ridiculous. Technology in Overwatch also doesn't really work. I don't like the latency issues caused by data centre approach to servers. I'd prefer player controlled and owned servers. The loot box system is cancer and makes the game unfunny and unenjoyable since you cannot play the game to have skins and other costumes you want. Instead you'll receive random things and seeing constant boxes of duplicates is very very common. What little there is music", it's great. Most of the characters are decent but some are just throughout useless and hinder the lowest common determination combination possible which might win. Widowmaker in particular because most people are not good at shooting with sniper rifle in this game. And each time you see a person select Widowmaker you know your team is going to lose. Character balance is just bad in OW and the amount of characters make sure that it's impossible to reach a balance. Just don't. Don't get into Overwatch unless you have a group of friend who constantly keeps playing this game and you all think alike, drink same liquids, eat same food, live under same roof, etc. You will lose as an individual player regardless of your skill level and history in FPS games. And I know it isn't a real thing in most games but in Overwatch the ELO Hell is a real thing and it exists and once you get into sub 1500s in competitive mode there is no way out from there unless you have a group of friends to play the game with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I got Overwatch after some peer pressure from friends,  one of the reasons I was against getting it was because of major hacker problems.   Guess what, It still has hackers problems!  But the thing is; it doesn't really matter that much on open play or bot matches because you can still have fun, just don't expect to win every match. Now for Ranked matches,  hackers should be dealt with but it seems alot fall though the cracks because of the way the characters, and skills work.   Is there a lot of hackers in the game?  Yes, in fact its fully of hackers but there are also a lot of highly skilled players who have been playing since the game launched and being able to tell the difference between them is near impossible sometimes.   You can blame Blizzard here for allow net cafes (PC Bangs) in Korea for this problem - they recently banned 20,000 accounts? But since they can create an infinite amount of accounts and smurf accounts it really compounds this problem especially if they don't get banned quick enough. One of the things I don't really like is that fact the match making system is obviously worthless, it just doesn't work.  I'm a level 15 currently, a new player...so why am I'm being placed in matches against level 300s?  This absurd matchmaking is one of the reasons why I'm deducting points,  in a game that is 90% Competitive PvP - a proper matchmaking system is important and Blizzard fluff'd this. Next problem is the absurd and overpowered characters,  some characters are so WTF overpowered it isn't even funny,  and other characters are almost pathetically underpowered.  But most of the time, it isn't going to matter that much at least when your enjoying the game. I like the idea that you can get some decent stuff from loot boxes without paying, and the MTs don't effect gameplay at all, which is kinder rare these days for FPS games. Another problem is that, honestly? There isn't very many maps,"  limited variation - it seems they added a few new game types called ""The arcade"" which I haven't tried yet", but I'm going to assume if they use the same match making system then for new players, it is going to be a waste of time and will be frustrating. The Co-op feature vs Bots is something I feel like I'm more able to enjoy the game,  and I wish more game modes was available.  Finally, it seems a lot of the reviews have compared this to TF2 and honestly,  I saw that immediately when I first played the Route 66 level, the color and style felt almost like a rip off -  another issue is that with this 50/50 win/loss ratio,  getting placed into a good team and being carried, winning several matches...then being placed into a team with wildly different levels then losing then next few matches. In hindsight,  Overwatch isn't a bad game,  not worth $60 and I feel bad for anyone who paid full price at launch and regretted it,  I paid $40 for the GOTY edition and looking back, I feel like I should have just got the basic version and saved $10....however,  I'm okay with my purchase and this game is something I can have fun with,   new players though I don't recommend binge playing because you could quickly get bored with the repetitive maps, and loses due to poor match making. Another major issue is the fact that getting skins," especially with the current ""anniversary"" event is way way too hard", or way too expensive.

MikeZillaGames,positive,6,Overwatch is highly polished. The gameplay is fast, fun, and enjoyable. It plays A LOT like Team Fortress 2. And herein lies the problem. At first you'll be excited and mesmerized by Overwatch...but after several dozen matches you'll come to a realization: you've just paid $60 for a game that has one-tenth the content of TF2. No modding community, not as many maps, and worst of all onlyOverwatch is highly polished. The gameplay is fast, fun, and enjoyable. It plays A LOT like Team Fortress 2. And herein lies the problem.

No modding community, not as many maps, and worst of all only two modes. Team Fortress 2 currently has death match, team death match, king of the hill, capture the flag, and escort the payload. Overwatch has king of the hill and escort the payload. That's IT. There are lots of other things TF2 just does a lot better as well. I think another big problem is that Overwatch's unlockables system is horrible. TF2 brought unlockables to the game WHEN it became free to play. With overwatch you pay $60 dollars and yet they STILL managed to sneak in micro transactions. Want as skin? Well, you could wait to earn it with in game currency, but as usual this takes ages. Or, you can pay real world money for it. The matchmaking is crap, too. Kinda like a MOBA, one bad player makes the whole team crumple BADLY. The process feels like playing World of Warcraft battlegrounds/arenas with a pick up group...and I didn't want to pay $60 for that experience. Right now the game feels like it's an early access game almost. The gameplay is solid, but it's lacking content. Frankly, there's no way I could justify dropping 60 dollars on the game as it stands now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AlexHallett,positive,6,Overall Overwatch is a decent game however it has its flaws. It has relatively solid game pla with a variety of heroes with different skill sets. This allows you to easily find one you prefer with the bonus of all of them being unlocked from the start. Another great thing about Overwatch is that micro transactions are only for cosmetics and so don’t give players an unfair advantage. TheOverall Overwatch is a decent game however it has its flaws. It has relatively solid game pla with a variety of heroes with different skill sets. This allows you to easily find one you prefer with the bonus of all of them being unlocked from the start. Another great thing about Overwatch is that micro transactions are only for cosmetics and so don’t give players an unfair advantage. The game also requires little time commitment however can be played for hours at a time without getting boring. Overwatch has a distinct art style which is consistent throughout its many maps. But this quickly gets boring with the lack of maps for each game mode. One of the best things are the events such as the 'summer games' which add a new game mode available for a short amount of time. These are good for when you get burnt-out. The voice acting is very good with multiple different voice lines for each character. However, there are multiple flaws with the game such as the small amount of game modes. These are assault, escort, hybrid and control. However, this is increasing as recently as death match mode has been added. Another flaw is that it can be frustrating as a solo player when you are matched with pre-made teams. Another bad thing about this game is the fact that is doesn't have a single player/co-op campaign which is a disappointing due to the amount of lore behind each of its characters. The closest thing to a campaign ever added was a singular story mission which came with the games 'uprising' event which only lasted 3 weeks and then it was gone. This shows that blizzard has the tools to create a story mode but for some reason haven't. The worst thing is the community which insults and belittles you every time you do something which isn't to their liking. This is mainly in competitive however but can also occur in quick play occasionally. It is better value for money now due to the fact more maps and heroes have been added since launch however can still get boring as some maps seem to appear more often than others. Overall, I feel that this game is fun but is ruined by how repetitive it is (seeing the same team comps in every game) and also its horrible community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eNVyous,negative,4,Overwatch has the potential to be a good game. But there are SO many things wrong with it. For one, the lack of content. Within hours of playing Overwatch, the lack of maps and balanced gamemodes will start to grate on you, since it's practically the same match over and over and over and over, unless you play the Event gamemode, which is still restricted to once a year. Maybe it's even aOverwatch has the potential to be a good game. But there are SO many things wrong with it. For one, the lack of content. Within hours of playing Overwatch, the lack of maps and balanced gamemodes will start to grate on you, since it's practically the same match over and over and over and over, unless you play the Event gamemode, which is still restricted to once a year. Maybe it's even a one-time thing in general! This is something that Team Fortress 2, another class-based shooter, does very well. All gamemodes and all maps are playable from the get-go, aside from the Halloween maps, because, well... Halloween. Mann vs Machine, the TF2 equivalent of Overwatch Uprising is available all year long, with a free and paid matchmaking system, where you can have a chance of earning an Australium weapon, which is gold-plated, and sell it for a high price, even thousands of dollars in some instances. Overwatch has none of this. Sure, it has lootboxes, but after a few lootbox openings, you'll start to get duplicates more and more frequently, and you basically lost money for stuff you already have. Team Fortress 2 is also guilty of this, but at least you can get your money back if you sell it on the Community market or in-game trading system. Now, onto gameplay. Overwatch is repetitive as hell. The meta will almost always take place, especially in Competitive play. There's no variety in match-ups," unless someone decides ""I should be Sombra or Symmetra and lower my team's expectations but actually turn out to be good. The meta is also extremely not fun to play against with anything BUT the meta", and that's how no-variety matches are born. But why are those specific heroes chosen to be in the meta? Because they're much stronger than others. And this leads me to my next point. Overwatch is unbalanced. Take Roadhog for example. His hook used to be guaranteed death for anyone under 250 health, being able to hook people behind walls and objects. A year later, and it was fixed. But it's still really, REALLY, strong. Not as strong as it used to be, but strong enough to the point where it's frustrating to play against, especially if a skilled Roadhog player's playing. Bastion, Hanzo, Symmetra, Genji, Ana, Reinhardt, Tracer and many more are extremely strong and not fun to play against, while heroes such as Winston, McCree and even Zarya (without a competent team) are left in the gutter. My next point is about the skill ceiling of Overwatch. To put it bluntly, it's very low. For one, Tracer's mobility and dodging capabilities are all thanks to her boost skill and rewind skill, which replenishes her health as well, which is frustrating, annoying and unfair in all senses of the words. Comparing Team Fortress 2's Scout, who requires health pack placement knowledge, mobility mastering and quick instincts, Tracer's MUCH easier to play and master. Another comparison, between Medic (TF2) and Mercy (Overwatch) may look as if they are the same, but Mercy has her flight skill, in which she can float over to an ally and heal them safely, whereas Medic has to constantly stick around his team while simultaneously trying not to get his Ubercharge dropped by being killed while also simultaneously trying to keep his teammates alive. Also, Overwatch is much more easygoing. When you get killed, your Ultimate charge remains the same, whereas Medic gets his entire Ubercharge meter drained whenever he dies, except if he uses the Vita-saw. He retains a maximum of 20% ubercharge. Some weapons also have damage/boost/hype meters that require to be filled up (such as the Soldier's banners) which drop down to 0 as soon as you die. Overwatch has some semblance of skill to it, but it's not enough. One button press and you're in the air as Pharah. Simultaneous button presses and a LOT of practice, and you're in the air as Soldier (TF2). Now let's talk about hackers. Both TF2 and Overwatch have problems with hackers, but only Overwatch's has the capacity to shut down an entire match just because something isn't going correctly. On the other hand, Team Fortress 2's VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) system isn't doing very well, either. So my opinion on this topic stays neutral. There will always be cheaters. And finally, replayability. Overwatch DOES have some replayability and I'll give some credit to it for that, but Team Fortress 2 has a much larger replayability spectrum. I've currently put in over 1.5 thousand hours into TF2 and I've barely started to grow tired of it, whereas I uninstalled Overwatch within the first 40 hours. Although, Overwatch does have better optimization and graphics compared to TF2, which I will also give credit to it for that and is the only reason why I didn't give it a 2 instead of a 4. As I said in the start of my review, Overwatch has the potential to be a great game and it already is, for some players but it's just not enough for all of them. 4/10,,

As for the actual gameplay, not much skill required, it's pretty much like moving from snooker to pool. Very difficult to miss unless you are trying to miss.  Also it's pretty annoying suddenly dying at 100% health for no particular reason.Next is the social element, to be honest most players that I am on the same team with tends to be less competent then the computer at the easiest setting.  Additionally I tend to report at least one player every time I play, players refuse to actually realise what the game is about i.e. teamplay instead follow their own agenda and let the teammates die horribly.  Also those players who cannot play at all and blame other people on their team.To be honest the game has potential like TF2 in the early days before it became free to play and became as appealing as a crack whore with crabs.The main difference between this and TF2 is that TF2 has more variety, but unfortunately this game just cannot manage the competitive element.  As well as the classes being completely unbalanced and team members not wanting to participate as a team. To be honest I am waiting for Unreal Tournament 4, at least the bots would be a challenge!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inability to actually choose what maps to play on (and even game modes! You aren't allowed to select a game mode) is a very weird design decision. I don't think I've ever played a game before where you can't choose a game mode, but instead have one forced upon you. Many heroes are badly balanced due to Blizzard's choice to always favor the shooter, regardless of latency (and to make matters worse, Blizzard - for whatever reason - have chosen to implement notably poor tick rates in their servers). This means you will often times be killed behind cover or targeted by abilities that shouldn't be able to go through walls. A prime example of this is Roadhog's hooking ability, which will drag you through walls to the opponent who then instantly kills you. This happens more often than not, and is extremely frustrating to experience. For a game that is seemingly designed to be F2P but with a full price tag, it is alarmingly lacking in content. Would I recommend Overwatch? It depends... If you're a solo online player, I wouldn't be bothered by it. But if you can stomach the issues it suffers from and have some mates to play with, it might be worth a shot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

guyverz,negative,5,O how I wanted to like this game but for me it felt really average. Something about this game just lacks a soul. The designs looks nice but when playing it I just didn't like how it felt at all. I played most of the cast and there wasn't any character I liked. I thought i would like genji but he has a very high skill ceiling when compared to the rest of the cast which seems unfair. I wasO how I wanted to like this game but for me it felt really average.

Everytime i would see a scrub genji i would just bait him to use deflect and then unload on him. The characters dont seem to be balance very well and it all turns into a game of who can counterpick the best. The map designs seem uninspired. This game was built more for team play so its hard for anyone to carry. You will always need a healer just to get anywhere. There was nothing in this game that blew my mind. Maybe it might appeal to people who never played TF2 when it first came out. It currently feels like a f2p game. I don't know why the loot boxes are random when they should only give you loot for the characters you are playing. This game wasn't fun to me. I had more fun with battlefront and titanfall. I guess this is not a game for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jjoossee,negative,0,There's a good game buried in Overwatch, but it is grossly overshadowed by one of the worst match making mechanics around. Enforcing a 50% win rate, you will have frustrating, boring match after frustrating, boring match. Even if, somehow, you get a decent one, a rarity, the lack of maps will quickly make this game a dull use of forty dollars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other than that it fails on everything a good decent fps has to over. MOBA and FPS DO NOT MIX. IT WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA TO GIVE HEROES GAME CHANGING ULTS.

I'd play against AI if they weren't so totally braindead and if I didn't have to match with real players to be on my team. I'd honestly just say to stick to Team Fortress 2, at least for now. It has far more content, game modes, support, and customization, and it's free. Overwatch is prettier and has a wider variation of characters, but in the end the game's structure seems to struggle with itself far too much. It sets itself up to be a big, interesting universe with interesting characters and events, but then all it does is throw those characters in a pit and make them duke it out. Hopefully in the future Blizzard will add some more substance to this game, but as of right now, it feels pitifully average.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's your standard class based shooter that we've seen done a million times before and Overwatch doesn't exactly do anything different. The maps are good except when they're not, the weapons are unique except there's like only 3 useful classes in the entire game and it does have humor except there's another class based shooter that does it better (tf2). You know what just play tf2. It's much more fun and way more polished the this piece of forgettable mediocrity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

klkevinkl,negative,5,My experience with Overwatch has been a mess. The graphics of the game are bright and colorful instead of dark and gloomy like every shooter out there. Each of the characters has different abilities that they can use to their advantage in order to try to control whatever objective they are aiming after. A lot of the tanks have some kind of shield that can block damage. There are charactersMy experience with Overwatch has been a mess. The graphics of the game are bright and colorful instead of dark and gloomy like every shooter out there. Each of the characters has different abilities that they can use to their advantage in order to try to control whatever objective they are aiming after. A lot of the tanks have some kind of shield that can block damage. There are characters that specialize in tank slaying as well. The least played role is support though. There is a time limit to capturing the points, but it doesn't really matter since as long as someone stands on the point, it goes into overtime and overtime can extend indefinitely. The increased death timers do not really matter. If a match gets tied at the end, the game goes into sudden death where whoever captures the first objective instantly becomes the winner. I'd rather have the game just reward whoever did it faster with overtime counting against the team as well. One of the best things about the game is its focus on objectives rather than just flat out kills. Individual players matter a lot less than a group that can play together. But here in lies the problem. Players are grouped together based on a Dynamic Queue and premade groups inherently have an advantage. While the game does try to pit premades against other premade groups, it doesn't always work out. You often get very one sided match ups, especially since they allow for a massive variance in skill in ranked. There was one game where I was playing with a rank 30 and a rank 60 pairing on the other team while I was in the high 40s. Needless to say, the rank 60 wiped out everyone and I still had to suffer a massive rank decrease for it. My biggest complaint about the game is the lack of sense of progress. Your progress is measured by collecting experience from games. It takes 22000 experience to gain a level with most games netting you about 2000 experience. In about 11 to 12 games, you should gain a level and earn a loot box for 4 random items. The problem here is that duplicates are turned into very tiny amounts of currency, I'm talking like maybe 5. The cheapest items need around 25 while the most expensive cost 1000. There are some that you also cannot buy," such as the pre-order bonus Widowmaker and anything marked under ""events"," like the Summer Olympics themed items. When I heard this game was buy to play, I was hoping that it would be free of all the problems that came with free to play games, but I was wrong. This is a buy to play game with a cash shop and they do all of the things that free to play games do. They start with pretty bad servers. There are times when I randomly get disconnected for no apparent reason even though my Internet went down. There are times when Blizzard randomly decides to implement a patch with no warning, forcing everybody out of a game and having everyone take a loss. You can purchase loot boxes with real money to earn items faster and duplicates do get turned into currency. The second complaint about the game is balance. I really have no idea what they were thinking when they did some of their patches. Soldier 76's and D. Va's shots were made to be highly unstable to the point where you literally have to be in their face to use it. McCree constantly moves between insanely broken and insanely useless. To top it off, too many characters have invincibility abilities. While invincibility might be nice for something like an ultimate, far too many people have it as a defensive ability, especially when they can still be targeted by allies for things like healing and they still are counted as contesting a point.

Nothing you do actually takes place in the game's lore.  At all.  All lore is explained outside of the game.☼  Although the game FEELS responsive, the truth is that the game runs on a 'favor the shooter' system with a low tickrate.  What this means is, if someone shoots you on their screen, it will register as hit even if you were not where they shot you based on your screen.  Think Planetside 1.☼  The game is -extremely- frustrating.  You will stick to a 50% winrate give or take 5%.  You will get placed in unwinnable matches, you will get placed in matches where your team dominates.  You will sacrifice playing your favorite character often because other people will not play characters/roles required or will pick characters/roles not suitable for the match. Overall, Overwatch may be a better experience if you have 6 people to play with, or at least 1 person to queue up with, but ultimately for most of us, I think, the game is just a very frustrating game.  I was hoping for better from Blizzard, but if you're prone to getting upset over games (which I am not, but man...) this is a game to avoid.  Like I said, you will get forced to play something you do not want to play, you will try your hardest, and yet even so you will still lose.  You will still encounter people who refuse to do something for the team, you will find people who pick characters that are not suitable for the match, and on top of that the playerbase is extremely hostile. If you want to play Overwatch, you have to be mentally prepared that you will not own, you will not get to play what you want to play, and you will get called names/get hate directed towards you.  You really need mental fortitude for this game otherwise you will rage and just feel like crap.

The game has terrible maps, 2 game modes, immensely stupid characters with one button combos which in most instances are impossible to counter. The rock paper scissor balancing is the biggest nuisance in the game, but that is to be expected from Blizzard who are known for atrocious player vs player experiences. The game runs on 20 ticks servers, which is something that should be a thing of the past, basically it is like playing BF2 all over again. You will get shot through walls and behind cover constantly. If you have ever played an FPS before, you will get annoyed with this game almost instantly once you realize that there is no difference between people who are absolutely garbage and people who know what they are doing. Some of the ultimates are literal aimbots, meaning that even if you're the worst player with parkinsons and brittle bone disease you will get easy kills. The skill ceiling of this game is reached within the first few matches. The only competitive thing being the pre-match sitting-around-in-spawn arguing with people trying to make a coherrent team. Not that it matters, as one button ultimates will demolish good or bad alike. I've played CS 1.6, CS:GO and BF2-4 on a very high level and I can without the shadow of a doubt say that this is the worst FPS game I have ever seen. There's no recoil, you don't need to aim as the hitboxes and abilities will do all the work for you, the servers are atrocious 20tick compared to 128 in games like CS, the graphics look like TF2 but use resources like it's the Witcher with hair physics on with useless garbage cluttering the screen at any given time, maps are boring and horribly made with chokepoints. The custom game option is probably the only enjoyable thing about it to play with friends, as you can change the recharge and spawntimes of abilities, but even that gets old quickly due to the lack of content and the AI being absolutely garbage and it only being able to use about a 4th of the heroes in the game. It's overpriced, overhyped and a terrible FPS game. People will tell you that you're hating on it because it's popular"" but these people have no reference as to what a competitive game should offer. TL;DR **** maps", terrible balancing, boring visuals, no progression, no learning or improving one self except for map layout, atrocious matchmaking, terrible voice acting, dumb abilities and ****ty attitudes. Avoid at all cost, until it goes Free-to-Play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We're already watching competitive outlets outright ban maps like 2 Control Point and community map voting rules have effectively banned King of the Hill maps.

Sadly, that was all just a minigame, simple and unfinished but addictive enough to bait you into the real game that's hidden inside; and  what hid inside was a very, very dark place, exactly the same place that you can find in the Cs:GO or many modern games, and a place that will exist as long as 1st world players (be it 13 or 60), except to be treated like addicts, even when they're not, it's aimed toward those prone to addiction, vanity, and gambling. Those are the customers that every modern company aims for these days, and sadly, they keep coming back to play their slot machines," even though we all know ""the house always wins"". But unlike dangers and unappealing aspect of gambling and specifically slot machines", where everything and everyone warns you that you shouldn't spend money playing it, this road is paved by people shilling the game for you, You tubers with fake personas that ride every hype train and play along to the tune of the companies for their micro-share of the micro-pie, to soothe the vanity  and get their taste of fame," they will guide you to these games with fake ""omg amazing"" reviews", much like gaming journalists, only with more popularity and less rich vocabulary; there are no grannies with crutches standing in front of these slot machines, only people surrounding you pm-ing how cool you look in this or that skin, voice (new feature yay!)," spray tag.""Just cosmetics"" just became part of your social/gameplay xp.Most games today", especially multiplayer ones, are just 1 hour expiration date minigames that guide you into the real game-online gambling, with everything produced by other fans and players, but restricted to people because you sold your soul at the start of the agreement policy, and everything you produce while playing or being inspired by the mini-game can be recycled, and will be recycled, as a new product you have to pay for," be it maps or ""mission packs""", but it is all focused and boils down to the gambling aspect where you roll for cosmetic features that games are centered on, and you receive by leveling (10% of them) or spending infinite amount of money (and I do mean infinite, the more you spend and obtain the lower the chance for the skins you don't have but want to drop, to drop). Online gambling trap=1/10; Minigame called Overwatch you will get bored by in first few hours: 7/10 (could actually be a promising game," but don't be fooled to think you can ignore the ""it's just cosmetics"," silly"" because the game is all about those cosmetics", and everything will guide you to focus on obtaining all those silly cosmetics).TL;DR I cannot put this simpler: DO NOT BUY THIS. Just because you trust Activision-Blizzard (as good old Bobby Kotick said," explaining the WoW corpse yearly remakes: ""If we cannot run a game into the ground"," we don't want it"" meaning if the game isn't addicting/cool enough for people to deal with micro-transactions (understatement of the decade=straight up ego stroking for money) and addiction/vanity mechanics hidden inside", we don't bother with it. This quote explains a lot about the inner workings of the gaming industry, and that means any company,not just EA and similar designated meanies, they ALL work on the exact same business model from Valve through ActivisionBlizzard to EA, with some being nicer to your face but pulling their pants down once you turn around, and other's getting caught with their hands in the cookie jar, but there is no difference behind the curtains; there is no magic, just same suits working on the same con to exploit you. It's gambling with a mini-game attached, not vice versa.In fact, best thing you can do for gaming atm, is play only single-player classics with no DLCs to pay for or completely lay off video games, cause they are in a very dark place atm, as far as consumers are concerned. Moneywise or industry-related, they are blooming like never before and putting movie industry to shame, exactly because people pre-order and ride hype trains just to realize all of it is introduction into gambling (only more polished than a real casino, with all the geriatrics or the elderly turned into T&A; to distract you). It's nice for them to add some elderly character into the game, and some butch lesbian, and work on gender/age issues that suddenly became important; but when are we going to talk about much bigger issue of players-exploited, no matter the gender, and abusing psychology research a la Mengele to switch on addiction baits and turn players into chronic gamblers; or the fact that 2/3 of Pc owners can't enjoy most games with or without others,,,,,
Captain_Chaos,negative,1,Overwatch is a fundamentally flawed team shooter with uninspired character design, laughable balance, and over seven million players who once again assumed that just because Blizzard made a game, it must therefore automatically be good. I've never liked multiplayer in Blizzard games. And Overwatch is no exception. People like to say that Overwatch is the “new” or will “replace” TeamOverwatch is a fundamentally flawed team shooter with uninspired character design, laughable balance, and over seven million players who once again assumed that just because Blizzard made a game, it must therefore automatically be good. I've never liked multiplayer in Blizzard games. And Overwatch is no exception. People like to say that Overwatch is the “new” or will “replace” Team Fortress 2. This is completely untrue for a number of reasons. Really, this game should be compared to the equally poorly-designed Dirty Bomb. They share a colorful aesthetic and a quasi-militaristic character design, but also, and this is Overwatch's fatal flaw, an unbelievably awful damage model. The balance issues have been called out by the playerbase, and there do seem to be efforts made in that regard. But that ignores the deeper issue: Overwatch is, at its core, not fun to play, for the same reason most “modern” shooters are.Let me refer here to a game I refer to often, and will continue to refer to, an icon of the golden age of PC Gaming: Unreal Tournament, better known today as UT99, after the year of its release. Among the first entirely multiplayer-focused FPSs, Unreal Tournament required players to hone not only their ability to draw an initial bead on a target, but also their team coordination, knowledge of the map, locations of weapon and item spawns, and, ultimately, their ability to maintain your aim on a target and sustain an engagement until your opponent was dead, which in some cases could last for several continuous seconds. Can you even imagine? A gunfight in a team shooter that lasts longer then it takes to hit the like button on a picture of Tracer's ass? Overwatch has no “sustained engagements.” What it has, like what Dirty Bomb has, what Call of Duty has, what Planetside 2 has, what nearly every “modern” shooter has, is a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors, or perhaps a cell phone “clicking” game. The two teams crash together,  whoever picked the right weapon, or in this case, characters and mashed their ability buttons fast enough bowls over the other team, leaving them scrambling to group together and try to reengage successfully. It even manages to build on the “blink and your dead” gameplay by providing its characters with, in many cases, instant-kill abilities that, unlike Call of Duty, they don't even have to “earn” by “killstreaks”, they simply recharge on their own, over time. You won't believe how much time you can spend dead in a game with a 5 second respawn timer. Because it's a hell of a lot. It's surprising considering they've never made an FPS before, but Blizzard has created one so dependent on mere reaction time that you'll scarcely believe that every player but you isn't hacking. They've pushed the “modern” shooter to the pinnacle of its horrific genetic degradation,  successfully dumbing down FPS gameplay into a mathematical equation with only one acceptable answer. No time to look for health pickups or run to your healer. No time to turn around and counter-fire. No time to look for an alternate route to try and flank. No time for anything. If you do the slightest thing wrong, you're not only dead, you probably just cost your team the win. Sure, you could try some medium bot games to cool off, but they're some of the dumbest bots around and while they might be good for a laugh, they certainly won't give you good practice. Or you could play on hard bots and watch them mob up flawlessly and play murderball with your team and your mood. Or you could play some custom games with your friends and not earn any XP towards the game's paltry rewards. Overwatch attracts a certain subset of players that have no shortage of hate, especially where Battleborn is concerned. As someone with not only a lot of vitriol to dispense about multiplayer games but also the capacity to be aware of that fact, and as someone who is generally unpleasant when salty, I generally try to avoid games l  like this one. I bought it only because it seems to be the “in thing” with people I know and I'd rather be sociable then not. But really, the game just makes me sad, not only because it's a sorry excuse for an FPS, but because the vast majority of people seem to be blissfully unaware of that fact. I'm not saying I'm smarter then them or even a better player. I just think they've been lied to. I don't think any less of people for playing the games they want to play, because I do that every day of my life. But I can and will think less of people who willfully put down the games that I like because they're not Overwatch, or something equally formulaic. I give it a 1 here because it at least didn't crash. I am damn glad that I have alternatives. I urge everyone here to go give Unreal Tournament 4 a try- It's free, after all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can't just play with friends or hang out.  Blizzard has decided it knows more about how I should enjoy my game experience than I do and gives me no ability to say otherwise.Mechanics are a straight clone of TF2--not a bad thing, but TF2 isn't $60.No viable bot AI at all.  This means that there is no viable forum for practicing and getting better at the game.Map design is a bit awkward.  Choke points are presentNo game mode variety.  Most people play payload and capture point anyways, but sometimes deathmatch or arena add a lot of variety to an otherwise stale feeling game.Plays like a MOBA from first person view.  Locked abilities, no powerups, ultimate ability cooldowns.  This is basically World of Warcraft PvP arenas in an FPS interface.  I can't find new guns--there are no real points of interest on the map.  I don't even have to worry about ammo.There's no modding.  Want to make your own maps?  Blizzard's response is," ""like what we give you.""No story telling.  You can read some of the story and pick up bits and pieces.  Blizzard clearly invested a lot of time into this new IP", but failed to deliver any of it in a fun or interesting manner (maybe youtube videos count?  but that's not part of the game you buy. . .) Long and short of it, this game is the most atrocious cash grab since CoD 6.  It contributes nothing to the FPS genre and actually takes us back more than 25 years in overall gameplay quality.  Blizzard tried to make a game about interesting characters but missed the basic premise of a first-person game:  THE PLAYER IS THE CHARACTER!  First person games are supposed to be about choices and consequences and they jail their players into liking their interpretation of the first person genre, and then try to cover up their lack of basic understanding of the genre by paying off reviewers.  I expected so much better from Blizzard--but this really is their first attempt at making a FPS games and their lack of experience is painfully obvious.  If this was a 3rd person multiplayer action game, it might feel different and be more enjoyable, but at this point that's just an awful way to save face on an otherwise poorly executed game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That happens when one pays for promises, it's like buying a car without doors, but hey the promise you they will give these to you in 4 months. Great. Just great. AND NOT ONLY THAT, the game itself is a copy of TEAM FORTRESS 2. Yeah guys, the CORE is the same, but of course, it has a lot of improvements and a different gameplay vision (each character has its own abilities, etc...). So, paying $40 or $60 for that? Nope. If you ask me to review this game in an independent  way.. Well, it's solid, definitly not a 1. But it's not a **** F2P. You have to pay a lot, and the game has microtransactions, the worst kind of microtransactions, which is trending now in the industry. You like a skin huh, ok, you have to buy a box which contains random loot, so it's about luck to get your skin. Yep, you can't purchase it straight forward like in League of Legend for example. You have to buy a whole lot of boxes to get your skin. This is what I call random microtransaction.  So, overall: it's fun, but have a ****ed up competitive mode, it's still in Early Access metaphorically speaking, and it's priced like a AAA video game. **** you Blizzard and your awful politics.

It's technically correct that the heroes are all varied and balanced, but the way Blizzard has balanced them has been to make them all have fairly glaring weaknesses that need support. There are other games that are perfectly balanced where you still feel like you can make a big difference in a game, but in OW if the teammate you need to support you fails you're going to fail too without question. Players are essentially cogs in Blizzard's team synergy machine (but they're such well balanced cogs!). I think a great point of comparison is Evolve, which many critics said was too simplistic. OW is by any measure more simplistic than Evolve, except to maintain fake balance your abilities don't do anything compared to what they would in Evolve. If you don't do something about the Shield Beam in Evolve, the monster will lose without question, and when the Support goes down if the monster can't keep him from getting revived that can be game over. In contrast, Zarya in OW has a shield that lasts like 2 seconds. Big **** deal. Reinhardt's shield can be broken by Bastion in like 3 seconds - but it's never just Bastion, is it? I can't explain why I keep playing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UnkreativHoch2,negative,1,I really tried having fun with this game and i thought I did suceed at first. Its okayish in terms of a multiplayer online game but in the long run it has immeanse flaws.

Its not the evading player that is favored for, wel, evading, but the one shooting. that means, that if you are a tracer and blink around the corner you canI really tried having fun with this game and i thought I did suceed at first. Its okayish in terms of a multiplayer online game but in the long run it has immeanse flaws. One thing is the way hits and kills are counted in this game. Its not the evading player that is favored for, wel, evading, but the one shooting. that means, that if you are a tracer and blink around the corner you can die from a shot from a player with higher ping, that hit you on his screen. this is a well rounded mechanic for competitive matches in a closed network, but is the most **** up thing to ever be implemented in an ONLINE shooter. another thing is the imbalance of heroes. the game is kept in balance by competitive and regular matches. this means there is a massive skill difference in the balancing itself. the hero bastion, the sitting turret of salt, is a strong pick and saltgrinder in normal games, but is so easily coutered in pro plays, that he is considered weak and is apt for a buff. the hero dva was considered relatively weak in the pro play and is now one of the best picks in a normal queue. this list goes on for a while. Next nagging point: Matchmaking there is experience in this game. experience is gained by playing matches and, well, getting experience with the game. this means there is a big number that indicates a level of skill that this player is supposed to have attained. Now overwatch doesnt care at all. You WILL be matched with players much weaker than you or with players much much better than you for the sole purpose of creating relatively even win percentage," that enables blizzard to call their game ""balanced"". Now the thing that made me so furious I decided to write a review about my experience with overwatch so far. Loot.The loot - mechanic in this game is based on lootboxes handed out every level and always containing 4 items of varying rarity. these are white - common", blue - rare, pink - epic and orange - legendary. now white and blue is so common it doesnt even need to be divided at all and epic skins equal mildly rare items in every other game with loot. only legendary items are relatively rare. loot must not be obtained by luck alone but can also be bought for ingame curency, that is NOT buyable but has to be collected either as drop from boxes or from duplicates. additional to that there are skins that are exclusive to certain game editions or events. and these events are what caused me to see the **** that is the reward system in overwatch. Loot has been examined by reddit users and the largest quantity of loot listed there was a table of the experience of 30000 players. now they found that legendary loot spawns approximately every 14 boxes. now I had managed to obtain whole 4 legendary skins prior to lvl 35 and then started investing huge amounts of time in the summer event, to get exclusive skins, as i had already gotten 1. now I invested a whole day, not with sleep and eating, but whole 24 hours of my life to get more skins of the little above 4 legendaries for all 20+ characters. and when i hit lvl 53 at the end of the event i had an astounding 4 legendaries with 2 duplicates of said legendaries. of the 60 skins available I managed to pillage 4 and the game gave me 2 more of those i had already in possesion. now one might think they would be valuable, but they are not. Legenfdary skins cost 1000 currency (cur in short) and a legendary currency drop values at 500 cur. that means you have to get 2 legendary currency drops for a single legendary skin, but what value do legendary duplicates have? 200 cur! that is not even enough to buy an epic piece of loot. 5 legendary duplicates equal 1 skin in the shop, and the skin you might want to have cant possibly bought as it is an event skin you cannot get. you cant reroll these drops. you cant buy themwith money. you cant get them with time investment. the game is, as i said, okayish, but its flaws weigh out its pros heavily. to screw up something like a reward system so hard, a system that has been done right in so many games, even in blizzard ones, is so sad to watch. i really wanted this game to make me have fun, but this single thing made me hate it so much.buy the game, have your fun, but dont expect a balanced game or teamplayers. Do not open the lootboxes and dont even try looking at the hero gallery. you wont get much fun, they made it that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I waited through beta and launch to see the full reviews to buy this game. As the majority of reviews were positive I decided to give it a go. I am not a Blizzard fanboy and my choice of game is FPS, so this is my first weeks impression of the game. If you are a casual gamer who enjoys FPS shooters then this may give you an idea of the game. Characters: Pros - The game comes with all characters unlocked. They are very nice creations and look amazing. Each individual character comes with their own play style and perks allowing team creation. I have yet to find a significantly overpowered character, so balancing seems fine. Cons - The game comes with all characters unlocked. The use of special powers leaves a lot of characters feeling slow and lumber some. The tanks feel as though they are fighting a losing battle as they have high Armour and extremely low attack (except for Rienhardt who is melee). There is zero customization for each individual character meaning you have no way of changing a characters play style. Maps: Pros - All the maps look and feel great. Depending on game type their will be around 4 maps you play on, making a lot of maps. The maps have a decent amount of vertical movement which helps break up play. Cons - Even though there are a good number of maps the specific game mode to map make you feel as though you are fighting the same battle over and over again. A similar feeling to that of Battlefront walker assault (if you were suckered into buying that to for hype). Scoring System: Pros - The scoring system doesn't just focus on the sheer number of kills you made. It has separate focus on each character type preference, whether that be blocking damage or healing your team. Play of the game shows the 'best play of the game' instead of final kill. Cons - The scoring sometimes focuses on players achievements which are pretty average while leaving out the real MVP's who carried the games. While the 'play of the game' is a great idea, it seems to rarely focus on the actual best play of the game. An example, I made two double kills in short succession then used my special for a 5th kill in the space of about 5 seconds. At the end game 'play of the game' someone killed a player and themselves. Feels a bit empty. Loot System: Pros - Good Looking Skins Cons - Loot boxes are rubbish. They throw out loads of extras like tags that no one uses/wants and new voices that are generic. Every now and again you will receive a new skin. The skins are cool, but they are full body skins. This lowers the amount of customization and also the longevity of loot boxes as they are the only things worth winning. Also the majority of skins are just color copy's with each character having a couple of unique looks. Overall game play: Pros - Feel crisp and using the right power at the right time can be rewarding. Cons - Messy. Can feel slow and a bit of a grind. Movement is sacrificed for specials so there is no option to dash out of danger if needed. This also becomes annoying after you die and have to run back across the map to get into the fight. Guns feel under powered. Overall the whole time you can be running around shooting at people and not make a single kill, Something I have not experienced before. Alternatively, you could be making a load of kills and not even know as the scoring is so bad. Edit: Tick rate is really effecting game play. You will not realize the majority of the time that you are being shot at. This gives the impression that you are constantly one shot killed while not doing damage to anyone, until you see the kill cam and realize that you were being shot at for a huge amount of time. O Its almost a joke that is more funny than frustrating though. Conclusion: The game feels chunky and clunky. The fact that it focuses so strongly on team buildings means that individual casual player will always be at a huge disadvantage. No one in your team will want to be the healer and nine times out of ten you will find yourself in a game with all attackers. If you do have a good crew ready to play hopefully you have that mate who doesn't mind being the healer to follow you round while you rack up kill streaks.Each game feels the same as the last on that specific map. Use the same strong points to resist attack over again or vice versa.After a solid 30 hours really wanting this game to work it feels lacking and I have left feeling empty even through some of the best matches played.I would not recommend this game to any FPS who enjoys the likes of COD, BF3/4, Insurgency, Rainbow Six Siege, or even DOOM or Unreal tournament. This game is a FPS MOBA and it takes away from the overall skill of the game.The game is a gimmick and while feels great when first picked up, it quite quickly becomes boring and repetitive. For the price I may force myself through some more hours, but would recommend picking this up for a discount later down the line when bored of other your game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I went into this game excited by the style and variety of heroes. I was not left completely disappointing as the animation of the characters is stunning, and at times the game can be pretty fun. The unfortunate thing about this game is it feels terribly unfinished for a 40-60 dollar game. There are so few maps, like 3 game-types, and although there are 20+ heroes, there really isn't any way to customize their play-styles. The game is a full price game with the most disgusting F2P micro-transaction system I've seen in a game (crates drop when you level up, no other way to receive in game currency or crates even though you already spent full price on it). Another issue is characters are just terribly unbalanced. I play D'Va personally and find myself switching to junkrat and demolishing (literally) the opposing team considerably, and this is due to a terrible lack of damage, and very little thought to her ultra (with that being said her E attack can be pretty useful when timed correctly). Character like MCree will just need to see your team and instantly gun them all down from any distance thanks to his ultra, and Hanzo's insanely cheap through the wall arrow shot is sure to hit a few people as well. D'Va's ultra is composed of a big shiny mecha catching anybodies field of vision, giving five+ seconds before blowing up, and giving everybody plenty of time to find cover. The rubber-banding issues are insane, and I've had blizzards servers crap out on me a total of 3 times so far. If your looking for a good hero shooter with a decent f2p model, look no further than Dirty Bomb. At least Loot Cases drop after matches, heroes while not perfectly balanced are far more balanced than Overwatch, and the shooting mechanics don't feel like a tacked on afterthought. I really wanted to love overwatch, but instead I'm left dissapointed at a Beautiful, yet overprice, overhyped, and under-balanced product. Had this been free to play or even maybe 15$ or less, maybe I'd not feel quite as strongly as I do, but until Blizzard gets it together I really have nothing better to say for them. TLDR: If you love Moba's but wish they played more like a shooter then Overwatch might be for you, if you want a great hero shooter however don't make the same mistake I did and avoid this one like the bubonic plague, and hop on Dirty Bomb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is just another MOBA game , just on a FPS engine and POV. And the core of the gameplay isn't masterful shooting or dodging or jumping, no, it's rock-paper-scissors with picking the correct composition of hero characters. Well, I say you have a wide variety of Facebook games for rock-paper-scissors. And with such amount of content this game does not deserve to have a price higher than, let's say, Doom. Gave it 4 bars of 10, because that's how I value games: 4 bars for the visuals/audio/comforts, and 6 bars for the gameplay. Graphically it's 4/4, gameplay-wise it's 0/6 for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some heroes have literal aim assist to help them (you can watch ""arrows"" curve towards their target. Numerous characters barely even have to aim. The game is ""accessible.""  In addition to that", 4 (yes... 4) heroes have the ability to completely deny damage (as in remove it entirely), and all of the abilities to do so are on a ~6 second cooldown. That's absolutely ludicrous design for an FPS, it punishes good aim! Map design is bad... Many maps have small choke points some with only a single entrance, all of them are easily locked down, this turns the game into a meatgrinder until either the attacking side manages to eventually break through or the game ends (TONS OF FUN!) Matchmaking is forced 50-50. You can cheese the system by leaving games you're losing but despite being an incredible player, your W/L will tend to 50/50 regardless unless you're in an organized team, this is because it tries to even you out by putting you against far better teams if you're above 50-50.

Kornyous,negative,4,Overwatch without any doubt has many aspects that makes it a great game. It has great graphics, smooth gameplay and excellent quality of music and sounds. However, I am bound to mention that many aspects of the game are lacking in respect to the price of the game. As many other reviewers have said, this is a multiplayer-only game. The big issue and the elephant in the room is theOverwatch without any doubt has many aspects that makes it a great game.

As many other reviewers have said, this is a multiplayer-only game. The big issue and the elephant in the room is the pricing of the game. I really do not feel I received in fun the $40 I invested in the game; further, Blizzard disrespectfully decided not to refund the purchase even though I bought the game a day before. Despite the graphics, sound, and game-play, Overwatch is a lacking game in matters of:-Story: (giving a short background for every character in a Multiplayer-only game is as useful as waiting for a shoe to sing). -Matchmaking: I understand this feature will be added in the near future, but the fact is that this aspect should have been done before the game was made public. -Campaign: This would give light to the story behind each character, and I hope they bring it in the future (for free) In short, Overwatch is a BETA game released to the public as a whole game for $40 or more. For the playable contents of the game it deserves an 8.0. However, since half of the game is non existent, I will give it a 4.0. The fair price for this game is not $40-$60. It should be $20-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KnuckingFutters,negative,2,What may have started at a great concept on paper," ends up being a total disaster in game form. The game plays out much like a team-fortress mixed with some MOBA elements.

It's fun with friends in short bursts. But", if you plan on playing by yourself or for a prolonged length, prepared to get frustrated and bored. One of the few things that isn't pointed out much in other reviews is the horrid hitbox and tickrate that this games net-code utilizes. The game seems to favor the player with the higher ping (As sort of a 'benefit-of-the-doubt mechanic, I suppose), where... so long as they were on your screen at the time you attacked, they will be hit. So, there will be many times you'll scream in frustraition because you've backed around a corner, and still end up dead because the gunfire still manages to somehow make contact. It's very evident on Roadhogs chain-pull because in many situations, you'll find yourself glitch through the environment. But, you can also see it occur in many game-highlights where the game will snap the players view around to account for tick (making it appear as though your opponent is cheating via aimhacks, when-in-fact, they aren't... the netcode is just that terrible). That, coupled with the community's current trend of hanging on to characters with broken or easily abusable skills ends up making this game extremely frustrating a large part of the time you're playing. I really don't have a problem with cosmetic microtransactions since they hardly affect gameplay. However, the RNG system can be pretty crossing if you're looking for a specific character skin or animation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game is GREAT, but after playing for 2 days I had to return it. There is such little content it's enraging and the money-grabbing micro-transactions are so infuriating it's not worth playing another 10 hours to try n' level up for one more crate. The amount of items you do get is limited to around only 50 per character which makes you feel like very few people were actually creating for the game. Also after researching found out multiple companies were paid to give favorable reviews rather than spending their money on content for the game (the huge problem with it). I don't usually review games, but I felt like this defiantly deserved one, feeling more like a scam than an proper video game title. Game play:There's virtually nothing I can say about the flawless game play and amazing graphics/art style. But, there's more than enough money-grabbing politics and micro transactions that taint the game entirely and make it feel more like a free-to-play title. Story:There's no campaign, very intresting story video's online, but they're even present in the game itself. Offline play:There's virtually zero online play meaning in a couple years when the game developers stop patching and shut the game down your game will be worth $0 and never be able to be played again. Price: $60 for consoles, $40 for consoles, although console contracts have agreed to do extremely cheap or virtually free patching for games as of 2015," meaning they're doing you in the butt cause they think you're a stupid ""console gamer."" Split-screen:There is none. You do have training though", which takes roughly 10 minutes to complete both (combined) so there's that.... Overall: Gets old quick, really fun though, can see people playing it for years if they update it with a new champ every other month like League and new game modes, but I doubt this will happen and with the $60 price tag it's extremely overrated, oh and the fact they literally paid game companies like Machinima to give them positive reviews so there's that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theirrelephants,negative,5,The controls are solid, the graphics are pretty, the lore is embarrassing. Overall, Overwatch is exactly what it tries to be - an average class based shooter.

WithI originally pre-ordered the Game and have been playing since Beta. I am sad to give this Game such a Low Score as I had my hopes up high for this FPS. Blizzard is generally a company with excellent Games and outstanding quality, however Overwatch is no such thing. Originally Overwatch was a first person MOBA Game that required team play and team communication to win. With different Heroes being good at different Things in their own Way. This used to be its Soul, which sadly has been completely destroyed. Quick Play is now just a mode for you to try out heroes and get lucky. Arcade surprisingly is where people actually try and win, because each third win will get you a lootbox, for up to 3 Lootboxes. Competitive Mode is completely destroyed," thanks to smurfs and Boosters. You can go and google ""overwatch boosting"" and find millions of people that boost you up to any rank you want via their smurf accounts. This is especially frustrating when you try and want to get better in the game by ranking up. To explain this a little bit better this is the current state:Grandmasters & Master cant connect to anybody that isnt within 500SR Range", however if they make a new account they can play with anybody they want and stomp any SR below them. This Game does not require team play anymore, thanks to heroes being nerfed to either being unplayable or buffed to do the max dps possible (yes even the medics). Whats the point in taking Widowmaker a defense hero on defense? If Ana the medic sniper can do more Damage. The Game is not only incredibly unbalanced it is also rather unfair, especially when it comes to matchmaking. As long as smurfes arent banned from the Game the Competitive Mode will never work correctly. It seems Overwatchs Priority lays on one thing and one thing only, Lootboxes & Money. As they showed recently by adding a new currency you can only get by paying real money. Microstransactions in a 60€ Game is absolutely disgusting. So is Overwatch recommandable? Not at all, Overwatch has lost its Soul and its Charm. The Developer Team has been arguing within development and it shows its lack of love towards the game. Heroes have been completely rehauled making the game even more unbalanced then it was before. If it doesnt speak in Dollar Signs Overwatch does not care what you have to say. When they say they listen to the community, they mean we listen to the 1 percent of streamers and League players. When Mercy first got her complete revamp there was a 200+ page thread of people being against it, but nothing. The Team of Overwatch has completely gone off track and using it just to get money. Do not buy the game and dont support such greed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The loot drops feel pointless, not tradable like in Dota/CSGO.

JCDchameleon,positive,6,With constant comparisons by the community to the glory days of Team Fortress 2, Overwatch scratches an itch long since ignored by the AAA development scene over the last decade. Perhaps the filling of this void is what gives Overwatch it's real charm. Yet it's comparison to the rest of the genre is it's biggest fault: It doesn't provide the value I'm looking for. 40$ for two game modesWith constant comparisons by the community to the glory days of Team Fortress 2, Overwatch scratches an itch long since ignored by the AAA development scene over the last decade. Perhaps the filling of this void is what gives Overwatch it's real charm. Yet it's comparison to the rest of the genre is it's biggest fault: It doesn't provide the value I'm looking for. 40$ for two game modes and few enough maps I've learned the layouts within 3 days of my purchase doesn't exactly incite confidence in my wallet, especially with the number of unlockables (all purely cosmetic of course) stuck behind what is essentially a randomized paywall. For me, the fun comes not from the gameplay itself, but because it's the first game in years to manage to bring all of my friends together in one place after the moba genre split it apart. Crediting it for that reunion would bolster the score far higher than the game deserves. The characters are where the real focal point of the game and it's design lies, however the style of gameplay is what I would describe as mindless, and Blizzard's focus on trying to make sure everybody feels useful is horribly apparent throughout the game, going so far as to detract from any feeling of accomplishment I would get from actually performing well in game. Characters are constantly full of abilities that reward the player with eliminations solely for managing just to activate them while facing in the right direction. Eliminations are awarded regardless of damage dealt," with no differentiating in game between kills and assists. The showcased ""play of the game"" system will 90% of the time showcase a single ability use rather than showcasing a player that would actively demonstrate any real skill and game sense. It's accessibility is what I think is going to keep me playing for a good while however", with games being short enough that I can hop in for a few whenever I have a spare half hour without any worries, and I think that's a truly valuable experience to have especially with friends. I can't knock the game for it's community but if you plan to get anything out of this beyond the initial launch period it will be imperative that you find yourself a core group in order to achieve any sort of depth or strategy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Top it off with a truly broken matchmaking system where most of your games are steamroll victories or crushing defeats and you got yourself a frustration machine. Seriously", I'm almost always frustrated playing this game no matter how great my last match was. Victories are hollow and defeats are too brutal to learn anything from. It's just not fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real_pewdiepie,negative,0,Played 2 hours of the game and didn't like it. But that's not the problem, I tried to ask for a refund and was told that because I passed the lvl 5 i couldn't have my money back.

drymedar,negative,4,The absolutely horrible matchmaking system and a community that completely refuses to communicate (while at the same time consistently emphasizing how this is a TEAM game) completely ruins this game.

I'm decreasing my score from 7 to 4, at least until they flush out some new maps and game modes. Overwatch has a great diversity of character /'Hero's' with special powers or an 'Ultimate' power. Each hero feels vastly unique from another. I've played a total of about 40 hours in the past two weeks (total in game time - not in lobby or waiting to play). The game is superbly balanced and runs smoothly on older systems GTX 740 with core 2 duo (at least 30 fps on med low settings). The color and contrast, and texturing of the game is far more appeasing to me than that of TF2 or Battleborn (too much color, and little shading). The maps are individually unique, beautiful and require different team strategies and hero makeup to overcome ones opponents. I'm having a blast playing Overwatch...That said, I would not recommend buying the game at the current price of $40. See below for reasons why. -Currently the community is irritating to play with, only 1/10 players in pick up groups use a mic. -As a multiplayer only game, it is disappointing that there are no options to filter games. For example, I'd like to filter out preformed groups when I'm playing with a random PUG group. Also, the matchmaking for this game is horrendous. I've been placed into a game that is within 1-2 min. of the end of the match and loosing several times in a row. Further on this point, the devs have stated that match making takes into account several factors...including player performance to match. It now seems like I am stuck with players who really do not play at all as a team (no mic, no communication) and as a result my wins : loses is gradually decreasing. -We NEED more maps. 14 maps and only 3 types of game modes (the game states 4, however, two of which are really the same thing escort vs the hybrid). -There is little sense of progression. Nobody gives a s**T about sprays. -The HIT boxes are larger than they appear, it creates a system whereby players with poor aim get many B.S. kills, evident by the kill cam afterwards and the occasional frag when you are clearly safely on the other side of a wall (attributable to the hitbox). -You can shoot through your allies? WTH? I can understand no TKs, however this creates a scenario where Hanzo and Widowmaker get a bunch of B.S. eliminations without having to really place their cross hairs on an opponent.. Overall I very much like the game. Blizzard just needs to get more maps out, and create a filter system and then I would gladly bump my rating up to 8-9 which is a recommend from me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brackio,negative,3,Overwatch is okay, but it was definitely not worth the hype.  I'm going to be comparing it with TF2, its so called counterpart.

In fact," the whole game is basically TF2 with ""Blizzard"" slapped onto the cover. While the heroes are vast in number", every hero only has one set of weapons, and you cannot change them out with different ones made for your hero. This makes gameplay feel linear, and you can only do what the game makers intended. It's basically a competition on who can left-click faster. The main thing I am upset about is the attention this game is getting. At the time of this review, Overwatch has about 9 million players playing it, while TF2, the much better game, is left with 47,000. In conclusion, please, do NOT spend $59.99 on this game. It's not worth it, considering how incomplete it feels. If you want a way better game like this, try TF2. It's free and you'll probably like the dedicated fanbase the game has built up. The only reason I'm not giving Overwatch a 0/10 is that you can give $60 to Blizzard so that they can hopefully make Legion come out sooner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xevro,positive,6,Overwatch is a smooth and beautiful game, but is terribly lacking in both creativity and depth to make it up to the audience for its pricetag.

There is a terribly vague story-line(prologue) that has been given to the audience through webisodes, speculation and theories over the forums at the cost of not having anything in-game regarding a story. ( I do not count 'decyphering' (3) dialogue lines of Heroes associating themselves with specific heroes in a match.) There is a very poorly optimized progression system that doesn't feel rewarding at all. Every level you obtain a lootbox which contains cosmetic goodies and/or currency whilst every 10 levels you get a new portrait frame. That's literally all there is to the progression system. (I bet the reason they wiped this false progression after the beta; people that spent their entire time to reach high level such as rank 200, was simply to push those people to buy microtransactions immediately. Since it held no advantage over other players anyway, so it wouldn't have made any sense.) There are only two gamemodes, capturing points and securing the payload/explosives. You are unable to pick a specific gamemode yourself. There are 6 maps, the rounds are terribly short and you are also unable to pick a specific map to play on. The social aspect is severely uncreative, only pre-made lines as there isn't a 'partying up' feature within the game. Customization is uncreative as well, all of the skins are just recolours except the legendary ones. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unique characters, game runs smooth and a pretty art-style, but that's all there is to it. The cons outweight the pros clearly; therefore it isn't worth the price, considering the fact that this was supposed to be a Free 2 Play model in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That'll surely help its longevity! To summarize; a game that looks good on the outside but has very", very low depth and doesn't require as much skill as any budding FPS fan would want it to. This is pretty much Baby's First FPS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Running @1080p / ultra / 120+ fps with a 4690k / R9 290. Performance goes up a lot by decreasing graphic options, so 120+ is certainly not a mirage for inexpensive builds. + Business model>> Counting this as a positive point as I'm tired of all the P2W **** these days. I'm happy to pay 30£ / 40$ to avoid that. ~ Limited game modes>> So far there are no original game modes, only Payload, Capture the Point and King of the Hill. They are enjoyable but Blizzard can and should do more. - Community>> It's bad. 1) Language. Maybe not as bad as DotA / LoL / CS, I haven't played those games so I can't comment," but ""ez"" ""rekt"" and stuff along those lines is a common occurrence. 2) Team composition. It's clearly important in a game where each class counters and is countered by others", more or less harshly. Support classes (read: healers) are generally not picked, and a team without a healer generally performs badly. It's so bad that most of the times I feel pretty much forced to pick either role if I don't want to get stomped... as a result, my first and third most played classes are a healer and a tank. Also, class stacking (especially snipers... *cough* hanzo *cough*) is an issue, as less diversity is typically bad.I just had a game where most of my team were snipers. In attack. 3 hanzos, 1 widow, me (tank) and another guy (not healer of course). Yes, we failed hard. Now that competitive mode is out," people feel even more justified to fuc* around in quickplay because ""lol tryhard is just quickplay!!11"". On the other hand I understand that people might want to practice characters that they never get the chance to play", but that's Blizzard's fault for not implementing a TDM game mode. - Netcode>> I was happy with it at first, then I started noticing all the little issues that slowly pile up and make you realise that something is very wrong with the game. It uses a client based hit detection, but the client's tickrate is a mere 20hz (compared to 60hz of most online shooters). Also, awful hitboxes for projectile weapons make the whole thing much worse: the most notorious is Hanzo, who is able to shoot people behind cover due to the massive size of its arrows' hitbox. Also, headshots are very frequent and they always seem off in the killcam. - Balance>> Some classes are / have been very badly balanced.The most glaring example was Widowmaker, able to shave off 3/4 of most classes HPs and kill a Zenyatta with a BODYSHOT. Instakilling a class with a bodyshot from a semiautomatic sniper rifle with no sway, no bullet drop, huge magazine and little recoil is insane, I wonder how that made it past QA. - Matchmaking>> I was very, very disappointed. In short:1) Most of my games are stomps. Stomps are never fun for me, even when winning. Close, enjoyable games are 20-30%.2) a LOT of premades. Joining as a solo player is a frustrating experience. The game tries to match groups with groups, but more often than not the result is quite imbalanced. Being in an organised group allows you to sync ultimates, that makes a HUGE difference against solos. The most irritating things are that you can't know who's in a premade (in quickplay), and the fact that even competitive does NOT have a dedicated solo queue. Also, make sure you join with strong friends. I tried joining with some friends who are not really good at these games (one never played FPS...), the matchmaker tries to match you against other groups that are often very organized, so it ends up being WORSE than solo queue. 3) Leavers not being punished enough. You can leave a game and avoid a loss in your statistics.The poor sod who fills the spot, instead, will get the loss (if the team loses of course, which is likely at that point).This can happen even in the last second of a match. That happens to me around 15-25% of the times I start a match. That means you join, see the counter at 1 second, get a loss and you're booted out. Excessive leaving will trigger a temporary penalty in exp (-75%), but that simply means less levels = less lootboxes = less skins. Not a big deal. Even worse, leaving in competitive causes massive skill level gains reductions for EVERYONE, even the other team.- Bull$hit ultimates>> This is entirely personal, but I HATE ultimates that pretty much simulate cheats - I'm talking about Widowmaker's wallhack and Soldier's aimbot. Lame, lame, lame.Conclusion:A great FPS with a very solid foundation, unfortunately plagued by many (not unfixable!) issues that ruin the whole experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pros:-  There are a lot of heros with its own playstyle that create countless team-based strategies in this game.-  The gameplay is short enough so if you are faced with a team of cheaters, then it will be over quickly unlikes CS GO I am stuck with a cheater for a full hour.- It encourages teamplay over lonewolf type of style. It feels so rewarding when you execute a strategy as a team. And there are a lot of heros that allow all sort of cheesey strats. Cons:- Micro transaction system makes level progression extremely slow, as they encouraging you to buy the crates instead of grinding out the EXP for skins and customization.- There are simply not enough content to justify the price tag, comparing to other big titles out there. You pretty much get 3 gamemode and that's about it. I wish they would implement the Arcade matchmaking like in StarCraft 2.- It's too much rock, paper, and scissor. You cannot really main a particular hero, so it is hard to grow emotional attachment to one of them, especially where you can customize their appearance. You're required to switch out heros that counter the other team's hero in order to win objectives.- Heroes like genji has very high skill ceiling and it feels outright broken when it is used by a very very good player. It can feel broken at times, and there are no characters that would shut him down hard. .-  You would still need a very good FPS skill to perform well.  Aiming is very important part of Overwatch to win the games, but not as important as CS GO. Characters that require little aiming can easily be countered by a player with superior aiming.-   The teamwork in this game is very involved so you will need a premade team of 6 people to play the game. Solo queing often leads to frustration, as you sometimes get a troll or a rager in your team and it can get very toxic.-  Due to the team based nature of the game, most games I play is either one team steamrolling another, and vice versa. It makes this game very boring. Matchmaking is based on how well each individual perform in a game but the match itself relies on how well the team cooperate rather than individual performace.-  Individual performance is not as meaningful like other games. Sometimes you felt like you did so well, but there are simply no meaningful recognition. It's important to be recognized for your hard work," especially when soloqueiing. This has result in most games I play everybody only wants to do a successive elimination so that they can get on the highlight ""Play of the Game"" after round ends. Going for the objective becomes secondary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is practically no story in the game, the only story are animated shorts and comics from outside sources to help build the world of Overwatch. And while these are made with the high quality one would expect from Blizzard, the game itself lacks any sort of explanation to who these characters are and why they are capturing points/pushing payloads.However, what little story there is can be found in Easter eggs, character dialogues and before mentioned outside sources; these story elements helps makes our 21 characters more interesting and engaging. and i wish Blizzard would have fleshed out the story with an in game campaign. Gameplay is where Overwatch excels in my opinion. This is a team focused game and Blizzard have design the game around teamwork. Not once have I ever felt that I wasn't contributing or I was carrying my entire team. The maps are creatively designed and the gamemodes, while very basic and simple, have been balanced and polished out to a high standard. There are 22 (as of Sept. 25 2016) playable characters with more on the way and each of these characters feel unique and useful, even the supports have cool healing abilities and can kill anyone.There are 3 main gamemodes: Quickplay, Competitive, and Brawl. Each of these have a variety of maps and objectives to do, however they may get repetitive after a while since the objectives are just attack/defend points and push a payload. And since these are the only gamemodes for now the amount of content will seem lacking for now however Blizzard have promised more for free in the future so that will really decide the worth of the game In terms of microtransactions, the game can be played without spending more than the premium price. The microtransaction are lootboxes that you can either get from leveling up or buying them with real money. However obtaining lootboxes by leveling up gets much harder for lvl. 40+. But the only thing these boxes gives are cosmetic skins, sprays, player icons, and voice speeches; lootboxes are completely optional so it won't give any gameplay advantages if you buy 1000 of these to someone who hasn't spent a penny. Overall, Overwatch is a great game to mess around with friends. And while the content so far has been lacking, Blizzard's promise of free characters and maps has helped ensure me that content will keep coming for many years to come.I recommend you to buy this game at $40 if you love first-person shooters, teambased games, or have a bunch of friends to play with.

leaveit,negative,3,An underwhelming, overhyped, overrated game. It is Team Fortress without Capture the Flag and 20 years later. It is Tribes without vehicles or substantial verticality and 18 years later. It is Battleborn or Destiny without single player. It is Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory without originality or campaigns and 13 years later. It is Brink without freerunning or interesting unlocks and 5 yearsAn underwhelming, overhyped, overrated game. It is Team Fortress without Capture the Flag and 20 years later. It is Tribes without vehicles or substantial verticality and 18 years later. It is Battleborn or Destiny without single player. It is Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory without originality or campaigns and 13 years later. It is Brink without freerunning or interesting unlocks and 5 years later. See that new character trailer for Ana? It's the medic from Killing Floor, but 7 years later. It is all these things but less, and yet it is rated equally or higher than any of them. The art assets are stunning, fluid, and surprisingly consistent in their styling. The game runs practically without a hitch. And yet it is dull, uninspiring, unoriginal, and hardly fun. Weapon reloads break up action for no reason. Respawn times break up action for no reason. Every game mode is a variation of capture and hold with minimal variation in the back end. Character classes are almost exclusively lifted from prior team shooters. Off the top off my head (straight from memory, no checking): Tracer is the scout from TFWidowmaker is the sniper from TFHanzo might as well be the samePharah is the soldier from TF or a soldier with a spinfusor from TribesJunkrat is the demoman from TFMercy is the medic from TF 2Zarya is the heavy weapons guy from TF and TF 2Torbjorn is the engineer from TFReaper is the spy from TF (2 specifically)McCree's special honor is having the spy's pistolRoadhog is the smoker from Left 4 DeadEvery support character's powers are lifted verbatim from City of Heroes - Lucio is a sound defender, Symmetra is an energy/force field defender, Mercy is an empath or the medic as mentioned, and Zenyatta is roughly a dark defenderWinston is essentially the tank from Left 4 Dead but with a gunSoldier 76 is Visor from Quake 3 ArenaD. Va is the mech from GloomReinhardt is also a tank from Left 4 Dead, but with defense powers of the assault from Global AgendaBastion is also more or less the HWGuy from TF in his applicationAna is the medic from Killing FloorMei is an ice controller from City of Heroes Who else is left? Genji, who is Grey Fox but worse. The designs are pretty good-looking and again, stylistically consistent which is rarely achieved. But we've seen all of this before, or at least I thought we had. Escort game mode is ripped straight from TF 2," which ripped it from Wolfenstein: ET (Gold Rush for example). Assault is as old as objective-based maps from Unreal Tournament (1999) or Counter-Strike but without objectives. Hybrid is a half-hearted attempt at solving that problem. Control dates all the way back to ""Canal Zone"" in TF", but its application was heartily used in practically every game since from all of the Battlefields to Global Agenda. Most female characters have identical faces; literally half the skins are palette swaps. Many unique features of previous team shooters were left on the floor for no apparent reason: single player campaigns, objective-based missions, elimination, free-for-all modes, CTF and Threewave - more than 2 teams at once for that matter, power-ups, escort-the-VIP, vehicles, story-based multiplayer campaigns, dedicated server listings, co-op modes, fortifications beyond just turrets and mines, freerunning, loadout customization, pets, modding... Again, all straight from memory. Overwatch is an utterly banal, unoriginal game that is light on content. It does nothing new at all: in fact, even the UI work is mostly borrowed conceptually from decades-old games like Halo 2. It uses no new or groundbreaking rendering methods. It does not make any developments in networking or technology period. We are made to believe that this game that could have come out 15-20 years ago, if not for poly count," deserves ""universal acclaim."" Think harder", and welcome to post-Diablo-2 Blizzard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretty much everyThe majority of the user reviews are people that are delusional enough to think that anything blizzard makes is worthwhile. Sticking with Blizzard games since Diablo 2, Stracraft," and Warcraft 3 I've grown impressed. WoW was something that did suck the soul out of my life for years. Now for me lately a majority of their games have not been hitting desirable marks. Pretty much every expansion after WotLK was a disappointment and Diablo 3 just didn't live up to expectations. I keep telling myself ""they'll do something their player base will like"," they care about their players..."" when in truth it doesn't seem like they really care about their players", even after they get kicked in the nuts like they did with the WoD expansion. I played a lot of HotS but overall i feel satisfied with the experience, too. This game is already acknowledged for it's toxic community, I feel like they had a missed opportunity with the cards after match where instead maybe they could elect people who had some beneficial effect for their team, such as a selfless character swap to help the team out. Also, the inclusion of taunts feel pointless if it's going to last for about 3 seconds and I die almost immediately when using it. Now that was about the report card I gave blizzard, now to get to Overwatch. Also KEEP IN MIND this game has been in development for a while. All because they cancelled Titan doesn't mean they IMMEDIATELY went to the press to say they'd work on OW instead. The good: Pixxaresque animation Characters with personality and backstory Music The bad: Inconsistent hit boxes(such as roadhog hooks that hook people around corners) I'm not sure if this is the same as above but there may be a delay in game or inconsistent animation timers such as Zarya's bubble the game's balancing issues around snipers damage, mei, reaper, tracer, genji, zarya(maybe her shield buff duration is just a glitch) mercy ult, and since the game is more about heroes working together it seems questionable that they allow multiple of the same heroes. this concept is also rather game breaking as the double reinhardt, 3 bastion, and lucio set up. because of things like this some defenses are impenetrable due to poor balance. the inclusion of taunts no one will see except when bored waiting for match to start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It could be fun but in most cases very annoyingFirst of all I just want to say that this game is very well promoted and maybe the game is not as good as it seems to be. Now lets go to the main review: The game is good but not excellent and has potential to be something amazing...Gameplay and overall game mechanics are taken from TF2 but the heroes looks like something more close to Dota. It could be fun but in most cases very annoying due to unbalanced heroes,maps and abilities. The good part is that it will last for a few years at least and we are going to receive updates and new features from time to time. Also the sound is good and along with good graphics and optimization makes me to say that Overwatch is a must try game. Although the price is too high for this kind of game. At competitive mode the game is currently an attempt far for being good at this chapter but it could become good if they will continue to balance it because is hard to balance this kind of game where every hero has some special ability which is overpowered over another hero...The game is not competitive neither fun as well just aspire to be mediocre at both competitive and fun. Sincerely TF2 was so much better and fun, characters were more fun definitely. I think Blizzard is not experienced with FPS so this should be the cause for the mediocrity of game. On the other hand the item drop is good and even better we don't have microtransactions. There is a chance to 50% to like this game...I dont know but personally I liked it very much in the begining but got bored after 20 hours of game. When we talk about the events this is not a big deal at all as well because you get only some crates with skins and a special brawl mode (plus a main menu theme) and thats all...no map decorations or something special...(50/100 for me considering that that Blizzard still makes good games),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've played 3 competetive seasons by now and i'm definetely not planning to return anytime soon. I regret that i've spend so much time in this overhyped ""cybersportive game"" Pros:1) Good optimisation? (not sure)2) Presence of some kind of lore and lore-connected content  (Overwatch doesn't have  real complete lore", plot or story it just has few articles on each hero's bio and some comics and shorts; even DOTA2 technically has better story implementation," although it doesn't have official short movies) Cons:1) Overwatch team prioritise money over content making. Instead of adding new heroes more often than once in 3-4 months  and new DIFFERENT (not ""slightly different maps with other textures"") maps", new mechanics and rules they just create completely useless," boring and repetitive ""events"" which usually introduce one casual gamemode and pile of dreadful cosmetic items (most of them have really bad quality) to make kids more excited and sexually aroused than normally.2) Overwatch team completely  ignores game bugs and balance issues. For the AAA game overwatch has too many issues with that", which are not fixed or fixed partially after a huge period of time.3) Overwatch team totally ignores feedback from competitive players. Moreover, blizzard community office  tries to pretend to be responsive by making dev's diaries and organising drama on their forums.4) Overwatch is just boring to watch and play. Blizzard just did a really  bad job trying to develop Team Fortress's genre by adding heroes. Every game is the same, teamfights are won by those who charged their ults first and in the remaining time teams are just standing near objectives behind shields or cover (of they're flanking) and charging their ults again. That's it. I don't see any reason why i should explain why watching cybersport matches is dreadful (same picks, same spicks, same strategies).5) Competitive gamemode and low skill cap. Even thought this game costs about 40$, the game is filled with inadequate whiners, leavers, complete noobs. I dare say that i enjoyed playing competitive dota, cs:go, RTS's and so on much more than competitive overwatch. I could go on and review each specific issue with this game and each of blizzard's failures, but generally i said what i wanted to say. This game has no future in pro scene, unless blizzard will change their course and start to actually work on their game. This game just deserves online of 100k people on each platform, not more. Just don't buy it and wait until they'll make this game cost 20$ or free and add other microtransactions (apart from lootboxes).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Master25,negative,0,Hola esta es una critica en español y mi opinión de OW es de que es un fiasco y un total intento fallido de hacer un juego como el TF2 solo que los de Blizzard le agregan los poderes secundarios tipo moba y ya con eso según ellos tiene un juego la pura verdad este juego va dirigido al publico masculino y a niños por el echo de que trata del típico escuadrón de HÉROES y en TF2 no solo son 9Hola esta es una critica en español y mi opinión de OW es de que es un fiasco y un total intento fallido de hacer un juego como el TF2 solo que los de Blizzard le agregan los poderes secundarios tipo moba y ya con eso según ellos tiene un juego la pura verdad este juego va dirigido al publico masculino y a niños por el echo de que trata del típico escuadrón de HÉROES y en TF2 no solo son 9 mercenarios con mucho carisma, la gente que consocio el OW conoció primero al personaje femenino Tracer y luego ala WindowMaker gracias a paginas de arte o vídeos para adultos si saben de los que dijo y para mi es la primera ves que veo mucho de ese contenido para adultos y así ha pasado con todas las Mujeres del OW y hasta ahora la única que les interesa es la D´va por su estilo como chica Otaku Gamer. Y otro punto es de que el juego es puro OLINE y tiene los mismos modos de juego como captura la bandera, captura el punto de control, y la que mas me llamo la atención fue la de Carga explosiva como se dice en TF2 (que consiste de llevar por unas vías de tren un un carreta una bomba y llevarla su destino) pero a qui en ves de ser una bomba es una limusina blindada, la verdad es los mismos  TF2 sin excepción solo con mujeres muy sexualizadas y el publico no ve las criticas reales que son las de los jugadores a mi en lo personal no me interesa una critica de un critico de Ahora por razones de corrupción, lo malo que el juego esta incompleto solo ONLINE en serio a pero eso si puedes comprar skins que para mi es como si el juego lo hubieran echo hace 6 meses no loan terminado por falta de dinero y como se lo gastaron mas en propaganda de todo tipo si hasta contenido para adultos por que esos artistas no cobran barato y debió ser un buen trato, pero volviendo al tema del Gaming es igualito al TF2 y el TF2 es gratis y la comunidad genial pero esto que esto no es un juego real esto es un juego reciclado y pagar como 999.00 pesos mexicanos no lo vale y creo que sera de esos juegos como TF2 que antes fue de paga y después Gratis y como deje antes ami se me hace un juego incompleto y que aparte sera terminada después de recaudar dinero con los skins . Personajes:Los personajes de OW para mi y en verdad 2 o mas hacen a uno del TF2 como un ejemplo: WindoWmaker+Hanzo=Sniper del TF2 pero por que miren para los que no han jugado TF2 el sniper tiene varias arnas pero se dividen en 2 Sniper y arco y tiene la misma jugabilidad hasta las dos armas de Window que son el sniper y rifle de asalto eso los tiene el mismos Sniper pero del TFClassic y así con todos Tracer+Lúcio=Scout, Spy=Genji+Reaper+McCree(El spy tambien depende de los disparos ala cabeza), Ingeniero=Torbjörn+Symmetra, este he visto en el juego de OW 4 Heavy=Roadhog+BASTION+WINSTON+Zarya, Medic=MERCY+Zenyatta, Pyro=Mei, Saldado=Soldado: 76+Pharah,  y al final mi perosnaje favorito del TF2 que es DEMOMAN que se comforma 2 uno repetido que son: Demoman:REINHARDT+PHARAH(de nuevo)+JUNKRAT ere fianl es el mas copiado por si lanza bombas lapa y su famoso sticky jump, mismas mecánicas en todos los personajes y por favor antes de critica mal o bien un juego comparen los 2 tanto como OW y el TF2 que tiene suerte de ser gratis y no pierden nada Motivos por que su éxito:1.- Mucha publicidad de cual quier tipo sin perdonar.2.- Gaming reciclado de un FPS real que es el TF2 que lleva mas de 9 años apenas en este año.3.-Personajes femeninos muy sexualizadas tanto como en FanArt como en el Juego.4.-Mucha prensa Corrupta.5.-Una jugabilidad muy fácil como en PC y en consolas que la verdad lo puede jugar un niño que juega COD o Splatoon sin tanta experiencia.6.-El juego esta dirigido al publico masculino de 12 a 25 años.7.-Texturas muy infantiles y no tiene Gore.8.-Y personas que compran jugos pro moda. Gracia por ver este comentario y piensa lo 2 veces por que como dicen en steam no hay devoluciones Saludos :D! PD: Estes es un mensaje para todos los jugadores de OW o fanboys que dicen a los de TF22: juégalo antes de criticar al OW pues mira yo te dijo los mismo con TF2 juega primero TF2 compáralo con el OW y tu dime cuales mejor por que eso de decir que por que tu juegas al OW y muchos estén de acuerdo con eso argumento no se me hace una excusa ni aceptable por que el TF2 ya cumple en este 2016 sus 9 años desde su entrega y se me hace una tontería de decir eso pro que el OW es de paga y por que uno que no le gusta ese juego lo va comprar para hacer una critica buena pero en cambio los de OW puedes criticar al TF2 en total por que es un juego F2P y muchos jugadores le dan de User Score 9.1 t los críticos 9.2 en cambio el OW tiene miren que es raro decir esto un juego reciclado de un juego de VALVE que por los críticos: 9.1 en pc 9.1 en Xbox one y en Play Station 4 es de 9.0 he pero esperate esa son de los críticos pero la que en verdad importa es del consumidor osease el publico y mira que hay un cambio drástico: PC:7.0, y las mas fatales XboxOne:5.7 y Playe Station 4:6.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Levin,negative,4,The attempt is not bad. Its a game based on tons of fun and interesting characters.

Kurushi,positive,6,Overwatch has the makings of a great multiplayer shooter, but in its current state, overrated. It's lacking in content, has a large portion of imbalanced characters, which are spread across the roster too thin, making some of them feel useless if you're the 'wrong' class, with illogical strengths and weaknesses in some cases.

It's lacking in content, has a large portion of imbalanced characters, which are spread across the roster too thin, making some of them feel useless if you're the 'wrong' class, with illogical strengths and weaknesses in some cases. The most interesting mode, Escort (where you push or defend the cart TF2 style) doesn't have enough maps, where the other modes rely on lazily made symmetrical/mirrored maps with not much scope. Overwatch aims to be casual fun with your friends as well competitive if you want to be, but the skill floor is so high it doesn't take much skill to use certain abilities that you can't do much about unless you're a specifically  hard counter character - which is a poor excuse for balance if you ask me (whatever anyone says) Overwatch WILL be a great game eventually, when it's balanced properly and gets more content. All future content will be free, and with over 10 million players already, it's worth being part of the movement if you have the money burning a hole in your pocket. If you don't, wait a year or so until it's fixed I will probably be giving it a much high score, we'll see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, from this point of my review I want everyone to understand that what I'm going to say are completely my opinions and takes on how I enjoy video-games overall, so don't take this to heart.First of all, I'm a very competitive person, I have been playing fighting games and arena shooters for almost two decades, and what I enjoy the most of the games I play is how high the skill ceiling is and what your character's limits are and what you can do with him but, when I watch Soldier 76 mauling everyone without having to aim with his ult, Reaper's Ultimate and Bastion players sitting in one place shooting and killing everyone in sight with apparently no recoil whatsoever it's really off-putting for me.Now, I'm not saying that these particular heroes are over-powered since you can easily counter them with another hero, I just don't like the little effort that you have to make to kill someone in this game.I also think the maps are not that good with poorly placed health packs specially if we compare them to TF2's extremely memorable maps. TL;DR:The art-style is definitely my favorite aspect of this game and it is super fun with friends but, from a competitive standpoint this game doesn't appeal to ME, I know everyone is enjoying it and that's fine. The content is very lacking too.Kudos to Blizzard for such an extremely successful game. Peace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
supermanultra,negative,5,It's okay, but not for a full priced game. Not much content, extremely repetitive after ~5 hours, and the skill ceiling is insanely low.

I loved playing Genji, Tracer & Bastion.The problem is that there is not enough content to justify its price tag. There may be 21 characters but none of them can be further modified (save cosmetically). There are lots of maps but most are repetitive.Another problem is with the PS4 controls. I may have not gotten the sensitivity settings right (used default, then tweaked every 4 games) but I found it more difficult to to track enemies with the cursor compared to COD, Destiny, Borderlands. The cursor usually ends up overshooting. Like I mentioned might be due to the settings.

It's a game based around 20 or so Heroes that all have 'unique' play styles, you will spend all your time either bashing your head against a brick wall as you throw yourself against the enemy in an attempt to escort (Yes.. escort missions!!! So much fun..) the payload to a destination or completely stomp the enemy into the ground, all the while playing on escort maps that become ever more choke-points that render the enemy team an even greater advantage. There is also capture the area (Most balanced) and a combination of the previous two game modes leading to a hybrid of sorts. All be told there are a whopping ... three game-modes to play in. As with most games where you're locked into a character with unique skills and attributes there are some  who are exceptionally strong and those that are .. well.. In need of a minor buff, some tanks don't feel 'tanky' at all and support characters that are capable of dishing out the pain like a pure dps character. Almost every match-up I've had so far (It is early days yet I'll give the game that) has almost everyone choosing the sniper/dps hero's leaving me to have to pick up the slack and choose the support and/or tank. Since all the Hero's have unique skills it follows that there is a champion who counters those skills and enables you to progress as a team, it becomes extremely monotonous when you have to rock paper scissor your way through a match, although you can buck the trend and have a team made up exclusively of one hero (Yes hero stacking is a thing, blizzard didn't learn from league of legends), which on some maps is extremely broken. It does have it's charm however, the characters are all quirky and interesting (If lacking in the lore department), some having that edgy, dangerous look about them others are charming and cute, while some are a combination of the two, all of which are rendered in a very beautiful, stylized graphics engine. You have various vanity unlocks for each of them, from in-game emotes, skins, lines they can say and various different sprays, there is enough useless junk to collect that would give Ubisoft games a run for it's money. All in all I would wait for the price to drop before purchasing this game, it's fun in short bursts but it has it's issues to say the least, but seeing as this is a blizzard game the price wont see a drop until sometime in the next decade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This means that Blizzard cheaped out and is using a netcode model that was popular back when dial-up was still a thing. It also leads to a lot of unnecessary and frustrating deaths as the low update rate and their server prediction algorithms kill you because your own reactions to situations fail to register in time. Considering the fast-paced nature of the game, this money-grubbing decision by Blizzard makes the game frustrating for anyone with any kind of FPS experience and skill. It is currently one of the most hotly debated topics on their message boards, which they are ignoring. This issue, if not addressed makes the idea of Overwatch becoming an e-sport a complete joke. -Poor matchmaking (hopefully this sorts itself out as people supposedly have ratings that help them adjust their matchmaking accordingly) and accusations that they are using the same kind of matchmaking as Heroes of the Storm which forces people into games where they get stomped repeatedly if they win rate goes too high over 50%. -RNG crackboxes for cosmetics. This is a pretty blatant cash grab and preys on the psychology behind gambling addition," which some people are susceptible to. They should have kept random loot boxes for leveling but allowed you to buy whatever skins/emotes/sprays you want like they do in Heroes of the Storm and World of Warcraft. This decision was probably forced upon them by Activision who aren't afraid to do anything to maximize profits. -Hero stacking and poor hero balance. Some heroes are quite powerful while others are just meh. ""Pro"" teams stack the powerful ones. Some heroes are extremely cheesy when stacked", like Bastion and Torbjorn," to name two. There is currently no limit on how many of one specific hero can be used. -Missing features at launch e.g. no Competitive Mode. Yet the cash shop works perfectly. -Two-faced policy when it comes to banning cheaters. 2 ""pro"" players were busted for using aimbots in Overwatch competitive play. They were not banned and are still making streams"," playing competitively and making bank from the game. Yet Blizzard states a zero-tolerance policy for cheating and claims to have banned people caught. So it seems like if you're a ""pro"" player and bring visibility to the game from an e-sports perspective and help Blizzard make more inroads into the e-sports scene", you are treated differently from everyone else. The graphics, animations and sound are all excellent. The game looks good and runs well. If they can address the gameplay issues outlined above, the game is definitely one of the best shooters on the market but if they don't, it's going to sour the community fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are a person that can play same thing over and over with great character design this is for you. People still play League of legends but there is item variations so that can be different every match. Cs:Go also have repetitive gameplay but i think people are driven by learning skill and mastering shooting. In overwatch you cant swap weapons and skins are not that great too. Most of them are just recolors. Blizzard knew this game have shallow game mechanics but well polished, they even wanted to put it as free to play. But then they saw hype is building up, and understood they can charge people for that. Usually people who played 4 - 6 hours (total gameplay) say it is awesome. They are expecting that there is a lot more content they did not discovered yet. But in reality that is all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I couldn't take more than an hour a day of this ... shooter. I was trying like 5 heroes a day but in the end you will have to choose the hero that your team need to win. So I always must play heroes with extremly boring gameplay for me in order to get a win.4. It was also surprising for me that a game with small maps and little players number has such system requirements. I can only hope this was and intended feature of the game's engine so that it will develop more efficient or smth like that.3. They were making a free to play game, but when the main development was over they made a f2p game cost 40$! So basically it is a worse quality game because it was meant to be free, but they unlocked donation content so you have to pay for it a lot.After all, I can say that this game wasn't innovative or addictively fun to play. I gave a 6 to this game, cause it also has quite intresting story for each character, but it is completely ignored in the game, when everybody is killing each other with no lore reason and there can be 2 and more same heroes at the same time on the batlleground, so it was the same mistake like in heroes of the storm. I wonder how the game could've be if there were 2 opposite alliances of heroes like in wow, and the battlegrounds were actually some sort of scenarios and had at least some kind of intro for them on the loading screens.Simple version of the review: meh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the gameplay is **** Consistently **** I stuck with it for a week but it was painfully unfun. The flow of gameplay is schizoid; Disorganized to the point of painfulness. It wouldn't be an issue in a typical FPS game, but the format of Overwatch calls for some degree of organization which is not fulfilled by playing with randoms. The game doesn't lack content. It's just bad. Think of it... A lot of FPS games could survive on one or two core maps. Content is then created by player interaction. If those interactions are fun, you have a near endless supply of good content. A lot of people do play Overwatch," but if it wasn't backed by Blizzards advertising wallet it wouldn't be popular. (Or maybe perhaps if their current formula didn't ""work"" they might be more consistent with their products.) I won't deny that Overwatch is fun when teams ""click."" It's probably a blast with a regular team. Maybe it'll be more fun when the playerbase has more experience", and the metagame matures... ...But in my eyes Overwatch is ****e right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gameplay is good, the game is well polished, and Blizzard has worked hard to balance the heroes since launch. I had a blast with overwatch when it first came out and for a few months afterwards. The problem is player population. As the months have gone by, the shrinking pool of players in my country has caused the matchmaking to become worse and worse. It is now common to spend 3-4 minutes waiting for a match, even during peak times in the evening on weekends. These long waits are more often than not followed by an unbalanced match. I have no problem losing games, what I have a problem with is getting steamrolled by the same team 4-5 games in a row, then steamrolling another team, or getting backfilled into a losing game with no chance of winning. I understand that online matchmaking is not a perfect science, and the algorithm is probably doing the best that it can to provide good matches, but there simply are not enough players to make it happen. The $70AUD price tag for a multiplayer only game almost a year after it's release is almost certainly the cause of this problem. This game deserves a 9 for it's gameplay, honestly, however Blizzard's desire to gouge Australian gamers is killing this game, at least for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great Blizzard, just great, that's a perfect way to introduce people to your game. That doesn't mean the game isn't without positives, it looks great, it runs great, the heroes feel pretty well balanced, there aren't really any duplicates in the roster. But since there are no dedicated servers that you can run yourself that's it end of story you're stuck with the enforced 50% win rate, as opposed to interesting games or good teams or even being matched up with players of a similar skill level, nope 50% win rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Titanfall had an effective online story campaign in which ending scenes depended on who won the match for that scenario. Titanfall doesn't have the character appeal of Overwatch", which baffles me that there isn't a story mode at all for Overwatch. Overwatch feels like an updated version of Team Fortress 2 with Smash Attacks borrowed from the Smash Brothers, and skills you can use reminiscent of a MOBA. They integrate all of the abilities seamlessly, and it works so well that it's currently holding the entire game together. Overwatch is a good team-based FPS, but for it's own longevity it simply needs more content to explore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That being said, its a free to play game - that costs 40 to 60 dollars. Blizzard has an insultingly low amount of content within this game, and I found myself becoming bored and looking for things to do within the game after about 15 hours or so. Playing a little over 20, the first 10 - 13 were glorious," then it quickly turned ""monotonous"". Polished fun and addicting gameplay can only be fun and addicting as long is it keeps itself fresh", but sadly, overwatch does not have the feet to stand on a justifiable price of 40$, or 60$, if you are playing on console. I don't play on console myself, but its simply insulting for blizzard to make console players pay larger amounts of money for the same content. Not to mention there is a 60$ version for pc as well, which includes some skins, emotes, voicelines, and some small bonuses like a hearthstone card back. By buying this special edition you are paying 20 dollars extra for what I believe to be non substantial rewards. Overwatch suffers in many of the same ways evolve does, granted overwatch is better than evolve but they still share the problem of value. Neither has a campaign or single player, overwatch has 3 modes with one of them essential being a combination of the other two, spanning across a grand total of 11 maps (may be wrong on the maps but thats coming from memory). Blizzard and it's fans are claiming the game to be worth because of its upcoming content, but Blizzard has done nothing but promise future conent. the only future content that we have heard any details of is the upcoming competitive mode (which should already be in the game). The lack of content has often been explained by Blizzard saying that all the dev time went into polishing the game, but I don't buy that, considering the game is not balanced on any  level of play. I've said a lot of bad things about this game but its really not a bad game. It feels like an early beta game, but the graphics and gameplay are fun. The fact of the matter is, I'm already bored, and this doesn't have the legs to be a decade lasting game like Team fortress 2 was. There is a reason tf2 has had an active player base for about a decade now, because its its smart business model, its variety of modes and playstyles, and custom servers. Overwatch has none of these (excluding variety of playstyles), and I think the game will die down eventually unless blizzard either decreases the price of the game or puts all of its effort into seriously pumping out new content for this game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

See, this is a game where teamwork reigns supreme. If you can't work as a team, your side will lose, horribly. Like, embarrassingly bad. So when you join a game where your team refuses to work together (whether through character roles or just playing together) not only will you lose, but you won't even have fun. You will start to dread playing solo. And then you play as a pre-made group with communication and all of a sudden, this is an awesome game! You're having fun, you're winning and losing games, and before you know it, 4 hours have passed and you're wondering where the time went. But like anything, you'll remember the negatives more than the positives. I can't recommend this game to people who don't have a dedicated group already. Solo matchmaking is a gamble you'll more often lose, and winning doesn't even feel that rewarding anyways. Its stomp or be stomped, out of 194 matches," i've had 2 that I would consider anything nearing ""a close game"". Plus", an event in which no one could have possibly saw comming some characters are in need of a bit of balancing. Who would have guessed? I give it a 6. The good games are fun, let there be no doubt. Playing as a team, against other teams, is fun and rewarding, but playing solo is such an infuriating experience. I imagine some people will quit just from that alone, and I wouldn't blame them. Good teams are rare, but the bad teams make you regret buying the game in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High polish! More gameplay, more ways to enjoy! Awesome looks! High skill cap! And for a while, I enjoyed the game hard enough to give this game a 10. I had a blast learning every corner of the maps. I had a blast learning most of the heroes. I had a blast experiencing the full circle of human emotions, from joy after a hard win, anger and sadness after losing. It really is an investing game, .... or so I thought until I hit a problem TF2 never had. TF2 could switch up the ways one could enjoy the game. You could play the way Valve meant it to be played, but not only. If you wanted to go for a more casual experience, you could. If you wanted to be really competitive, more than intended, you could. If you wanted to improve some skills while still having fun, jump maps or sniper only maps were there for you. The list goes on and on.... Overwatch doesn't have that. Meaning that no matter how great the game might be, if you're looking for more than the simple package given by Blizzard you'll have to pass. But the real problem I had after 300 levels in Overwatch was the skill ceiling. After they removed edge dashing with Genji, there are no more tricks you can learn to get any kind of advantage in the game (they are legion in TF2)These kind of tricks, while giving you slight advantages, used to make me feel like I was progressing, that I was getting better at that game. Having no such thing in Overwatch means that you will feel powerless, like you're not progressing at all. The fact that you depend so much on your team doesn't help that feeling neither. In short,if like me you've REALLY liked TF2 and its diversity, you will be left disappointed in Overwatch. If you were looking at TF2 for a competitive experience, you found your game.If you never played TF2 and have no clue what I am talking about, go for it anyway!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gamemodes are almost a copy of TF2 involving either moving a payload or attack/defense control points. The way play these modes is through quick play, the weekly brawl, vs bots, or competitive(I will get to later). The game as of July 24th has 22 characters with there own ability's. Most of them are fairly generic like a sniper(widowmaker), a engineer(torbjorn), a scout(tracer), a soldier(Pharah), a medic(Mercy), and a demoman(junkrat), but the still differ themselves enough from there TF2 counterparts. The other characters though very one dimensional are fairly unique and offer a wide variety of gameplay styles. Each character typically only has 1 gun, 1-2 abilities, and a special. The guns control fairly well except they lack any recoil and really have a low skill ceiling to use most of them. Most of the abilities are cool like creating a ice wall or providing armor to teammates. The problem stems from the specials. Some of the specials are nothing much but the others are downright ridiculous. Here is where competitive falters, the specials not only are OP and unbalanced but take little to no skill to pull off.  Wallhacks, aimbots," Invincibility all sound like hacks but are REAL specials for some of the overwatch characters. That's not competitive nor fun to play with or against. To add to that there are broken hitboxes for most character and weapons making any chance to be competitive pushed to the side. Also you have to be level 25 to unlock competitive which takes far too long to achieve. The game even in casual is ruined by these ""Specials"" due to there limited skill to use and overall cheapness when you get killed by one. The soundtrack of this game however is great and fits the heroic mood of the game very well. I always enjoy booting up the game and hearing the music as I prepare for battle against...overwatch? Yea", the lore is fairly week as well as the gameplay doesn't correlate at all with the lore made for the game making you wonder what the point of having all those cool short films to advertise the game. Luckily that does little to affect the game play. The  last thing is the in game cosmetics which do look cool and don't affect the gameplay and it is fun to be rewarded with when you play more. The loot boxes are overpriced if you want to buy them but there really is no point. In conclusion Overwatch does have some great things going for it but as a competitive shooter it falls flat. Hopefully it goes for a more casual approach like TF2 did or a competitive approach instead of this frustrating middle ground of a unbalanced annoying mess. There is still going to be more updates so I'm eager to see what Blizzard does with the game in the future. 7.4/10 -Infinite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There definitely needs to be more maps, champs and game modes. But the good news is when you pay for the game you pay for all the DLC that will be coming out as well. If you're on the fence, wait a bit. It'll be interesting to see where this game goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cleglaw,positive,6,in first look its a very fluid, well paced good game with unique characters... but as you explore it more, you just realise it has big flaws in it. 1- some characters are so easy to play.its super annoying that you know you just got killed by some random clicks. for example, there is a bomber and all he does is randomly spamming infinite granades across the map. no aim, no wellin first look its a very fluid, well paced good game with unique characters... but as you explore it more, you just realise it has big flaws in it. 1- some characters are so easy to play. its super annoying that you know you just got killed by some random clicks. for example, there is a bomber and all he does is randomly spamming infinite granades across the map. no aim, no well spend ammo and fairly low cooldown of reloading. this isnt only character does this kind of things, many characters, in fact, requires no real thought or skill to play good. blizzard apperantly wanted a easy to play, casual game but i think they did way too over the top. if you can walk and click you will for sure, get kills eventually. its that much easy. 2- it too dependant of teamplay, and game doesnt help you to have a good multiplayer experience. there are roles such as like tank, support etc etc, and people can pick anything they want and actually this is a huge problem. why? if you value teamplay like me, half of your games will be about filling empty role spots in team. noone picked tank? you know you should pick a tank.. irresponsible players wont be sharing duty and you will sacrifice your fun more times then you can guess. also, you can encounter players who insist on playing characters they are bad at till forever, and its annoying that you know there is nothing preventing it. you see this guy, picking hanzo and playing terrible with, but still insisting on playing it for hours and hours, game doesnt provide any options for you to handle this frustration... it just lets it... because well blizzard wants it casual as much as it can be. 3- some hitboxes for abilities, or attacks, are ridicilously large... its too casual. at first i had great respect for some hanzo & roadhog players but later i found it was just too easy to make headshots with those caharaters. hanzo, the character which is supposedly a sniper, hits your head just by aiming your upper body. 4-it doesnt matter if you spend your coins carefully on legendary skins and content alike. they sometimes give free and absoloutly super looking skins that makes your legendary skin look thrash compared to it. for my genji, i purchased most expensive skin but blizzard recently decided to give away a brand new better skin for everyone who plays a few games in Heroes of the Storm. why did i even tried to collect all that gold then??? casualness of blizzard destroys a brliiant potential... if you are similar to other recent blizzard games its a common thing now. daiblo 3 suffered same things. my final score: 6/10. blizzard builds it and destroys it all by themselves. i dont reccomend spending money for this game, its allready overpriced and its not good enough to keep you playing if you look for replay values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FluffyBunnyBro,positive,7,I was pretty hyped for this game and now that I've played it its good. BUT it is definitely not without flaws.

One of the most annoying things though is that half the time I cant play my favoriteI was pretty hyped for this game and now that I've played it its good. BUT it is definitely not without flaws. There are many unique characters with their own play style and lore. which is probably the best thing about this game. The characters are awesome and each one feels different from the others. One of the most annoying things though is that half the time I cant play my favorite characters because everybody just uses the offensive characters and go off and do their own thing. Sometimes your teammates don't even pick healers and you feel the need to pick a healer and your team ends up with 5 McCrees and 1 Mercy. Also the balance is good but there are a few OP characters IMO: Bastion, McCree, Lucio, Roadhog, and D.Va. As long as you have a good team though you can beat your enemies easily (Unless you're up against 6 McCrees, then your screwed). The MAIN problem though is the price. This game cost $40 dollars on PC and $60 on console. Not to mention there are microtransactions. The microtransactions are just for loot boxes which can give you character skins, voice lines, emotes, player icons. Also there are Overwatch points which you can ONLY GET FROM LOOT BOXES! You should be able to get these points from playing the game. You can get loot boxes from leveling up but that takes a long time and most of the time you just get useless sprays and crap. Hopefully Blizzard makes a better progression system because if you could purchase JUST overwatch points with real money I might actually spend money to get Explorer Winston. Also $60 and even $40 is just too much for what your getting. Its fun but I really think it should be $30 at most. The end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although I'm not the biggest fan of Blizzard, you can tell they really wanted this game to succeed, so they put millions of man hours into making sure it at least worked properly. Character balance and map selection is still something that can be worked on, but there's always hope that the game will get better. With that said, I don't quite think it's worth 40 dollars.

TheWaffle,positive,7,Overwatch: Spam the Game. After putting in several hours of gameplay in the beta and the release, there's no doubt that this game has great potential. It's simple, accessible, and well-polished. It is Enemy Territory polished to a mirror sheen. However, it is very simplistic. The game evokes Enemy Territory's gameplay, but lacks the experience and talent development system of that game. ItOverwatch: Spam the Game. After putting in several hours of gameplay in the beta and the release, there's no doubt that this game has great potential. It's simple, accessible, and well-polished. It is Enemy Territory polished to a mirror sheen. However, it is very simplistic. The game evokes Enemy Territory's gameplay, but lacks the experience and talent development system of that game. It also lacks any kind of inventory or character customization. That would be fine, except the classes are extremely barebones. The fact that most abilities cooldown within 2-4 seconds leads to crazy amounts of spam, and the winning teams almost exclusively include some combination of Mei and Junkrat. Ice wall spam ruins the fun and Junk Rat is easily able to get his ultimate and get 2+ kills every time. It would make sense to work off of the audio cues to try and dodge, but since his bomb-tire has so much health and can be controlled and has a massive blast range, it's hard for all but the most agile heroes to dodge. Roughly 50% of my deaths in game came from that one ultimate, even after I learned the audio cue to spot it. Allowing multiples of the same hero on the same team, while often touted as a deep strategic choice, only encourages spam. There are enough characters with enough tactical overlap that it would not be detrimental to limit teams to one of each character. Allowing people to change characters mid-match is also a bit goofy, since the matches are only about 10 minutes long, while players are locked into the same class for 20+ minute games of Heroes of the Storm. I look forward to the game after some balancing changes, specifically: increasing the cooldown on Mei's ice wall and reducing the damage or radius on Junkrat's ultimate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key issue is- where is the rest of it? 21 heroes is plenty for release, and the interplay of direct counters (such as snipers hitting the large bodies of tanks with ease) make the strategic elements in the game great. However, you get 12 maps and only 3 game modes. THREE. I played this game thoroughly throughout the beta, and I had a fantastic time testing out characters, understanding tactics for each objective and so on. The issue is, once you have got to grips with it all, what else is there? No ranking progression, no single player," and merely vague promises of additional maps and heroes coming.. as usual for blizzard ""Soon TM"". If you are the kind of person who can play the same experience for hundreds of hours on end (which admittedly is likely a large portion of the FPS player base)", then sink your money without care. Those of us who enjoy variety might want to steer clear until a more appropriate price point is settled or more content has been added. I think the life span for the game is an issue, and it could go the way of most other AAA purely online shooters- barren within months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maps are poorly designed, with multiple chokepoints which result in long lasting stalemates (even up to 10-15 minutes because of the overtime counter).

But after they finish the review, they stop playing the game. So in their mind, the game will always be that much fun and rewarding, when it fact it will not as it currently stands. But they were left with a good impression just based on the first ~40 hours or so they played it and they will move onto other games to review. RIGHT NOW, yea, the game is fun. But there is an eventual problem: -After a couple weeks, when you're taking a lot longer to level up, the Loot Crates take much longer to come by. You won't be seeing any rewards for just playing the game. That EXP bar will be moving in very slow chunks. You'll be tempted to spend MORE money on Cosmetic Loot Crates in the Blizzard Shop. -Blizzard better add a HELL OF A LOT MORE GAME MODES - NOT JUST MAPS OR NEW TOONS. THREE game modes?... That's it? That will get boring and repetitive real fast. In fact, it's already boring and repetitive. -The game is not worth $40, much less $60. It should be free-to-play. It is very light on content, has zero class/loadout customization outside of cosmetics and they have a Microtransaction Shop to let you BUY Cosmetic Loot Crates if you don't even feel like playing the game that much. These review sites are completely ignoring the long-term value of the game, of which there is very little to look forward to at the moment. They've been sucked into the intro experience and are not weighing what's to come, which appears to be just more cosmetic additions to the game. My review? 7/10 until Blizzard adds something more to this game. Maybe even some sort of co-op PvE mission-based stuff. Only reason I'm scoring it this high is because I do have faith in Blizzard to update and improve the game down the road. They have dramatically changed games like Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft with patches over the years, so there is hope. But how far down the road?. The core gameplay engine is solid, but there is very little to do with it in this game except run around in circles shooting at other people running around in circles. And your only rewards are a random assortment of cosmetic clothing or decals for 21 different characters, some you might not ever bother playing. It's not enough to give this game legs, IMO. 6 vs 6 is already tiring. Blizzard can do better than this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UI is a mess. Balance: The game is far from balanced. Tracer triple dashing for a ""mine"" then going back have a very low counter play. Same goes for Bastion", the turret of Tjor or whatever the **** his name is. Hanzo throws random arrows for the hope of a bounce/ricochet that gives a kill. D. Va launches her robot for kills since her weapon range sucks, and once robot is destroyed you are almost a siting duck. Sometime you die to random **** that is being thrown as there is no initiatief to safe abilities/throwables. Free kills! Also, since the ammo is infinite, and loading is like 0.5 sec.... there is no reason not to hold the fire button down. Hold the button down and wander around killing people you face, since they die way too fast anyway. Map design: The look of maps is great, but maps aren't balanced at all. Maps almost always favour 1-2 types of heroes and discourage other types. Ofc," support is always needed. Invisible walls are also to be found. Why? No reason. Sometimes you hit a ""wall""", and cannot fly/dash over it, or past it. The game itself is kinda boring after a long time. There is no much difference between matches. Maps do change, heroes not so often. Bastion, Widow Maker, Tracer, Mercy and Hanzo to be found everywhere. Match Making: This 1 plain sucks. Played 12 matches with 8 of them with the same people being thrown from team A to B and back. I cannot believe i'm getting matched with the same people over and over and over again. From time to time 1-2 players join/leave, but it's almost always the same people. Loot Boxes: These are expensive as hell, RNG as **** and you will never be able to get everything from just playing the game. It's a Buy2Play game, but you still need to pay to unlock skins.

Gowther,positive,8,"Overwatch is a fantastic new game from Blizzard which does a lot of things just right.Coming from a background of TF2 where I clocked in over 500 hours I knew that this was going to be right up my alley from the moment  that I saw the cinematic- and gameplay trailers.Something that seems to go unnoticed by a lot of people is the games' excellent sound design which makes sure that asOverwatch is a fantastic new game from Blizzard which does a lot of things just right.Coming from a background of TF2 where I clocked in over 500 hours I knew that this was going to be right up my alley from the moment  that I saw the cinematic- and gameplay trailers.Something that seems to go unnoticed by a lot of people is the games' excellent sound design which makes sure that as long as you pay attention then you can hear just about anything going on in the game; everything from ultimates to the enemies distinct footsteps.It seems like a fair amount of people are complaining either about the business model or balancing issues so I might as well comment on both of those ""issues"". ""TF2 is free and has more content"": TF2 hasn't always been free"," I remember buying Orange Box twice specifically for TF2 (once on 360 and once on PC) and at that time the game had significally less content than Overwatch did at launch. Loadouts wasn't even a thing at that time (let alone hats) so it was much closer to how character picking in Overwatch is at its current state. ""This hero is OP and keeps one shotting me"": The overall balancing is fine with some very few exceptions (McCree and Widowmaker) but those two do still have counters. Character switching is strongly encouraged in the game simply because it works on a ""rock", paper," scissors"" system. Having problems with an enemy Widowmaker? Pick Winston", D.va, Genji, Hanzo or simply a mirror Widowmaker. Albeit not as content rich as TF2 is at its current state," Overwatch has a lot of potential to grow. If you're looking for a ""new"" TF2 or just a fun team based shooter then you probably want to give this game a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GroundStatue,negative,5,Within 30 minutes I felt like I've played this game years ago after spending a decent amount of time with TF2. You cannot select which game mode you'd like to play.

You cannot select which game mode you'd like to play. The game is so reliant on both a competent team composition, as well as competent players behind those selections. It's difficult to ever feel good at playing this game since you're not given the opportunity to select the character you enjoy or want to learn.  Rather, you'll need to pick the tank or healer role most of the time. The alternative is that everyone is a sniper or Reaper and you'll lose the game within 30-45 seconds (this has happened to me more than once). Unless you're a huge Blizzard fanboy, more power to you if you are, this game gets old extremely fast. The $60 price tag for consoles is ludicrous," and Blizzard has the audacity to bring in microtransactions on top of that price. Every one of my friends I've played with has gone right back to whatever game they were playing after about 2 hours of Overwatch. P.S. A game being ""polished"" is not a feature"," it just means the game is actually working as intended.P.P.S. A game cannot be credited for ""world building"" when the only lore exists outside of the game. Where are all the former Destiny critics on this one? Winston says the world needs us? Somehow that translates the world needing us to push this car from point A to point B. Things can't be too bad in this world if the worst problem they need the Overwatch folks to solve is a flat tire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

darkaoron,positive,10,Overwatch is a Objective/Hero based FPS game created by Blizzard Entertainment that takes an approach to the heavily saturated genre of FPS in a similar fashion to team fortress.

The gameOverwatch is a Objective/Hero based FPS game created by Blizzard Entertainment that takes an approach to the heavily saturated genre of FPS in a similar fashion to team fortress. The look, feel, and game-play elements of the game however are nothing like that of the popular F2P titles of TF2 other than its core aspect and a couple of game modes that have been cleverly renamed. The game modes may have the same objectives as other FPS but unlike other FPS each map is designed around a specific game mode and does not have to share other game modes into its boundaries. This allows for each map to have elements and spawns that are designed around that specific game mode in mind. Each map evolves as you play through the match as the offensive team pushes through to their ultimate goal. Cleverly placed choke holds allow for strong defensive counter play, but hiding spots, and holes in the map allow for sneaky Hero's to pry the defenses away from the choke point but getting behind the enemies front lines. Each character has several abilities that give them flavors and counter plays to specific encounters, and a game breaking ultimate ability that must be charged through damaging enemy players, or waiting long enough, allows for hefty changes in the dominating forces. Each game provides a chance for the loosing team to somehow pry themselves a win last min with an overtime clock, giving the game a close win/loose feeling at the end of every game. Aesthetically this game is a world of its own with how well the art styles is done and how well the music and textures tie into the game play. Characters feel alive as they each have a personality that is reflected with every bullet they shoot, or ability they activate. This game is polished, clean, and balanced and is one of those rare titles that you can say is flawless. This game might not be the best game out there, but it can certainly be considered a perfectly designed game. Each element was hand crafted by the developers and molded into a game that is a perfect representation of what the developers wanted it to be. A game that truly deserves a perfect score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game has no long term playability, its not competitive at all.. the game doesn't even have a scoreboard ffs! (Pretty sure it doesn't even have ranked play yet either, but I tell you now no one will take seriously the game is so low skill.)  What FPS doesn't have a scoreboard, as a result games feel boring, bland and you have no reason to get better when you can't compare yourself to other players. The skill cap is so low you literally can destroy teams camping in a corner playing one handed as Bastion. Skill-less game for the casual market that will be dead in 6-12 months time. I actually had high hopes for the game coming from a TF2 background, but sadly Overwatch is just a bit of casual fun that gets boring after a few hours. I tell you now the only reason a lot of people are liking at the moment is because it makes noobs feel like they are pro with the pointless plays of the game sh*t that you can get by just pressing one button. Game is a joke tbh. Its definitely not worth its price tag, its literally looks, feels and plays like a free 2 play game. This is also coming from a big Blizzard fan.. played WoW for over 5 years. since its beta... that also started to cater for the casuals and literally ruined the game. Looks like they have still not learnt. £££ comes first I guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TitaniumDragon,positive,9,Overwatch is a team-based objective-based first-person shooter which relies heavily on highly differentiated characters for its diverse and dynamic gameplay.

There are four broad classes of characters, though in practice, twoOverwatch is a team-based objective-based first-person shooter which relies heavily on highly differentiated characters for its diverse and dynamic gameplay. The game includes 24 characters, each of which has a distinctive gameplay style and unique weapons and abilities. These characters are what make the game special. There are four broad classes of characters, though in practice, two of them are often treated interchangeably. There are “Offense” heroes, characters who are focused on high mobility and dealing out lots of damage quickly, and “defense” heroes, who are more focused on zone control and dealing damage at range. There are support heroes, who are healers (plus one character who feels more like a defense character and is treated as such by the player base), and tank heroes – big, tough heroes who can take a lot more damage than their comrades and who can protect other heroes in various ways. Within each of these, there is a lot of character variety. Offense heroes include heroes such as Tracer, a fast character who teleports around the battlefield and who can use a “recall” ability to rewind to her previous position and hit point status, whose gameplay centers around teleporting around enemies at close range and unloading her close-ranged weapons into them; Pharah, a character with a jetpack and a rocket launcher who can fly and shoot rockets at people; and Soldier 76, a fairly “normal” hero with a long-ranged assault rifle, the ability to sprint, and the ability to throw down a healing station on the ground and heal all nearby allies. Defense heroes include sniper characters like Widowmaker, who uses a Batman-like rappel hook to get into high spots and whose weapon can transform between an assault rifle and a sniper rifle; Bastion, who can transform between a walk-around mode that fights sort of like a standard FPS hero, and a sentry form, where it turns into a gatling gun and rapidly mows down its adversaries; and Mei, a character who can create temporary ice walls, freeze enemies with her ice gun (slowing, then stunning them), and shoot icicles from range. The support heroes range from Mercy, a character similar to the Medic from TF2 who heals a single nearby ally by pointing her stick in their general direction and holding it down to produce a healing beam, and who can fly around to allies in need of help, to characters like Zenyatta, a floating robotic monk who throws metal balls at his enemies while selecting individual allies to passively heal or enemies to passively debuff by causing them to take additional damage. Others include Lucio, a character who can ride off of walls and passively heal his allies by standing next to them, and Ana, a sniper who heals her allies by shooting them with her gun and who has a powerful tranquilizer dart which can temporarily put enemies to sleep until they take damage or as much as 8 seconds elapse. The tank heroes include Reinhardt, a huge man in heavy metal armor with an enormous hammer, no ordinary ranged attack (though he does have an ability to launch a fireball every once in a while), and a huge shield that his allies can stand behind; Winston, a genetically-engineered gorilla who rapidly jumps around the battlefield zapping people with an area of effect gun and dropping large spherical barriers to hide under; and Roadhog, a gigantic man with a hook who punishes enemies for approaching too close in the open or attacking his allies by dealing heavy damage to those nearby. These heroes work together as a hopefully coherent whole to try and complete map objectives. The game is heavily reliant on teamwork, and all of the heroes have their jobs to do. While everyone can deal damage, the specialities of various heroes result in different gameplay, with some characters acting as harassment, others as anchors who can protect their team and claim areas, others healing, and still others laying down large amounts of damage or inconveniencing the enemy team. The game revolves around fairly simple battlegrounds; there are maps about capturing points while the enemy team tries to stop you; there are maps about both teams trying to capture a control point between them; and there are maps about pushing a payload through them which heals attacking heroes while they stand on it while the other team tries to stop their progress. In competitive mode, the teams switch between offense and defense on the same map, first attacking, then defending, or vice-versa. Like all such games, this is not for everyone; after the first few hours with this game, even despite all of its seeming diversity, you will have seen just about everything the game has to offer. From there," it is all about mastery. How much enjoyment you get out of Overwatch is heavily dependent on when it goes from ""fun with mastery"" to ""tedious repetition"" for you", personally. If competitive multiplayer games bore you quickly, this will, too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hanzo is obnoxious with his arrow hit box and ultimate.-Some levels have awful chokepoints that are overly hard to break through.-PoTG... the worst idea conceived  by man since the Nuke and Justin Beiber.  It's a team game which rewards ONE person who managed to press Q the right time.  If only it was skippable.-Hero balance in general.  Some heroes (Mcree, Hanzo, Widow,) are too strong while others are so rarely played that it's hard to tell.-Match making is abysmal.  Apparently 6 man teams on coms should face teams of solos and pairs... and is perfectly fair.  Solo play in this game has little redeeming value.-Some character repetition in certain maps make them very very difficult to deal with.

With the game only having my two favourite TF2 modes (king of the hill (Dustbowl stylee) & payload) this game looked like a total no brainer.  My first pre-order since the Burning Crusade , I had a bit of something I needed to sort out that week so I took the launch day off as a holiday from work, great call, lovely day, sun shining - sat inside all day with the curtains closed!  So far I've put about 7 or 8 hours and currently sat at lvl 11 or 12. The game play - it's fun.  There is no denying that.  I found it a struggle last night to go to bed on time," was always the ""just one more match!!!""", the heroes all play differently, the weapons hit with impact and audio and visuals are great.  Seems to be well optimised too, I'm running a (I think) 3.6ghz i7 with 32gb RAM and a GTX 780ti, a rig that is a good couple of years old now, however it ran all day yesterday at a solid 60fps with the graphics set to ultra.  Fantastic.  Experienced one crash (while tabbed out of the game) which required a full reboot - may or may not have been the game, also updated the graphics driver earlier on in the day.  Other than that everything appears rock solid. After playing through a few of the heroes, I was delighted to see that the game healers  were seriously fun to play.  Got a few hours in as Mercy then finished off with Symettra, missing my ubers abit but that mass res is awesome. The main problem I see with this game, and for me it is a huge deal breaker - the match making.  I hate match making systems like this, COD & Battlefield like.  With TF2 I have a specific server I play on (donate to also) and as such I play with the same group of people every night.  Usually there is about 70% regulars and 30% tourists.  When you log onto the server, people say hello.  You know who are the good players and who to avoid, who plays what etc.  The voice chat banter can be fun and entertaining," depending who's on.  With this your just thrown into a group of total randoms.  Unless your running premade groups.  I can see the pre-made groups of friends steam rolling random groups.  Think TF2 with permanent team stacking and no scramble. Also there does not seem to be any ""skills"" like sticky jumping & rocket jumping etc.  Everything just seems to be button bound.  Which is a shame", I may be wrong here though. How big these issues actually are, only time will tell.  Right now, I can't wait to get home and rock a few more matches.  A month down the line...  I'll probably have gotten bored with this and gone crawling back to TF2 - not because it is a better game (it is though, in my opinion), purely because - all my friends are there and the game just feels more skill based. They really need to enable mod support too. I'll put a few hours (maybe months) into Overwatch, do I think it will knock TF2 off my top spot?  Not a chance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a major turnoff for me with other franchises (*cough* COD), and it feels great having a fair chance in every match rather than losing to someone just because they've been playing for 30 hours more than me to get the best weapon- Switching characters allows actions and reactions to every team composition, sounds weird at first, but you'll never go back after experiencing it.- Blizzard adding all future gameplay content (ie: everything but skins) for free. Plans for maps, modes, and heroes coming in the future. Cons:- MP only can still be daunting for some, although I contest that it is fun even for players new to FPS- Maps are specifically customized to be best for one mode, so no control on Route 66- Ranked play not up until June Overall I'd say definitely give it a try, you'll most likely end up loving it and purchasing it for yourself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a potentially good - no, great - game here but it is wrapped up in a myriad of poor design decisions such as questionable character balance, poor map design, poor netcoding, and the allowance of hero stacking (which exacerbates all three of the other issues). There are tons of complaints about individual characters but the issue really is a combination of all four problems always happening at once. Sure, the complaints about Bastion's sentry mode with no slow down on aiming, no spread on shots, and no ramp up before firing are valid but they're almost always a problem BECAUSE the maps are designed to heavily favor defending teams by either providing too few pathways for attackers, by allowing blatant base camping," or by putting an easy to defend choke point right outside of the defending team's spawn base (while the attacking team usually has to run a fair distance from their last checkpoint after death). Now add that the game allows multiples of the same character and one can see how the issues become multiplied. There's also the fact that Blizzard themselves have confirmed that the game's servers only run at a 20 tick rate (less than a third of what's considered minimum standard) and also includes a baked in latency delay to ""favor the shooter"" (read: prevent the need for leading shots) *on top of* each player's normal latency. Cheap"," unavoidable deaths (such as being killed as Mei while in Ice Block or as Tracer after Rewinding because the server simply didn't ""see"" it relative to your opponent's latency+built-in delay) are frustratingly frequent. The matchmaking system is just... bad. I generally split my time between running in a small group of 3-4 people or running solo depending on time of day. Not that it matters", mind: Regardless of running solo or grouped, either you're going to steamroll the opposing team or you're going to get steamrolled. In 213 games played so far, I can say that two dozen (or less) of those were close matches where the teams were really fighting to win. As for the rest, we either won by a large margin or lost by a large margin and very few last longer than 7.5 minutes. This might seem fun at first but it quickly becomes mindnumbing. I'm not sure what they use to determine rating for matchmaking but it feels off and it certainly doesn't help that some maps are designed almost entirely to promote steamrolls by the defending team - maps like Temple of Anubis and Route 66, both of which my usual group now leave any time they pop up in the rotation. Not because we can't win on them (we can and have) but because they're simply NOT fun to play on EITHER side. There are very few elements of skill in Overwatch, mostly found in the support cast of Mercy, Lucio, Symmetra, and Zenyatta. For everyone else, this is a game of luck: Lucky timing on the acquisition of ultimate abilities, lucky placement of the enemy team, lucky netcode timing/lucky connection, lucky map selection, and so on. I would love to say I have faith in Blizzard to deal with these imbalances but I simply do not considering many of them were known as far back as Closed Beta and still went live at launch (not to mention their 8.5 year long struggles balancing Warcraft's Arena PVP system with far fewer classes).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chipzz,positive,8,I don't normally write reviews for games but after reading some of the negative reviews as well as some of the perfect rated reviews I felt the need to write my own. So what do you get with Overwatch? With Overwatch you get a very well put together, polished, fun to play game that could have been a perfect rated game if not for a few missing pieces. I will start by listing the positivesI don't normally write reviews for games but after reading some of the negative reviews as well as some of the perfect rated reviews I felt the need to write my own. So what do you get with Overwatch? With Overwatch you get a very well put together, polished," fun to play game that could have been a perfect rated game if not for a few missing pieces. I will start by listing the positives followed by the negatives. Positives: -The game plays amazing. Everything about the games actually gameplay is perfect. The game plays really smooth. None of the very unique characters feel hard to control or awkward. Yes some characters are more powerful than others but the ability to change characters in mid game allows you to counter whatever mismatch your opponent throws at you. Most people who are calling one character or another OP are simply not educated on how to play the characters that counter that one. In all honesty if I see a player rolling with one of the popular ""OP"" characters it makes me grin because chances are they only know how to play that character and will be helpless when I counter them. - Playing with friends is a blast. Obviously this applies to almost any game but Overwatch is just a blast to play with friends. This game is chalked full of strategy and those hilarious random moments that make for an awesome laugh with a team of friends. Like others have said yes you sometimes run into that stubborn random who picks a character that doesn't fit your teams needs but for me at least that has been rare. Others mentioned that most games are blowouts one way or another but I would actually say the opposite. I have easily had more games that come down to the wire making for some epic clutch moments. - More content is on the horizon and will be free. While I could mark the lack of maps/game modes as a negative I won't simply for the fact that Blizzard is saying they are dedicated to growing this game through free content. It's my belief that they watched so many recent games have terrible launches and decided to hold back content on launch to avoid that (the game did launch very smooth). Although it lacks content in maps and game mods though the 21 characters at launch is a big number especially with how unique they are. Negatives : -There is no story mode. Obviously you have heard this already. Normally I wouldn't really care about this in a FPS. The only FPS I have actually played the story for is Halo. However with Overwatch this bothers me because the characters are so well made it makes you want something more. You want to know more about them", you want to play a campaign with them. They have released little bits of story but frankly it's not enough for a fully priced game. - Loot boxes are terrible and this whole new trend of gaming just needs to stop. I 100% support the idea of having cosmetic items that you can purchase for your character if you want to. However those items should also be unlocked by grinding or completing an achievement. Then to make matters worse you are not actually spending money on the stuff you want. You are spending money on a box that contains a slight chance of giving the items you want. I could even get behind the idea of loot boxes if I at least got to pick a character specific loot box that then gives random items for that character. Why would I pay money to get a loot box full of stuff for characters I don't like? Unfortunately I don't see any change coming to this. There are just too many people willing to pay for Blizzard to pull out of this money scheme. In closing it absolutely baffles me that people claim this game should be free. The game could be rated a 10 on the gameplay alone but the lack of a story and the micro transactions have to bring it down a few.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nataraja,positive,8,Overwatch is essential the updated version of Team Fortress 2, but in my mind is more polished and varied.  Its also a great experience that is simply fun.  Unfortunately it is online competitive multiplayer only and unless you get the PC version ($40 for the base game) you are stuck with the Origins edition for consoles with a $60 price tag - which is definitely $20 more than it shouldOverwatch is essential the updated version of Team Fortress 2, but in my mind is more polished and varied.  Its also a great experience that is simply fun.  Unfortunately it is online competitive multiplayer only and unless you get the PC version ($40 for the base game) you are stuck with the Origins edition for consoles with a $60 price tag - which is definitely $20 more than it should be! With that aside, Overwatch is a great FPS competitive multiplayer game that is easy to pick up and play.  Each character is very unique and fun to play. GRAPHICS: Great detail and love in the maps and to the characters - its very upbeat and lighthearted and works very well with a smooth 60 FPS. SOUND:  Great sound design with good banter and indicators as well as source to reception variability. SOUNDTRACK: Not amazing but fits with the game for sure. VOICE: Well voice acted with small tidbits of sayings and emotes - not a big part of the game but is well done none the less and adds to the enjoyment. GAME PLAY: Incredibly varied and fun but released with only 4 modes and 12 maps. REPLAYABILITY: Very replayable and is is built for replay and hopefully free updates will expand the content, but this is Activision that is publishing it and microtransactions are already present - so one will most likely have to pay for every piece of additional content. For me the game is worth $40 and I will get $40 worth of enjoyment out of it.  If you are on the fence, see if you can try it on console or rent it for a console to see if it fits for you.  If you like Team Fortress at all, then I think you will really enjoy this title.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dikiyKOPEK,positive,10,            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I've put over 50 hours into this game. Many people have put in more - because they've had fun playing it. Got hooked on the beta. If you haven't played the beta, that's probably the only reason you don't already have the full game. In all seriousness, it does something that no other shooter on console has done successfully - created a fun, truly team based, engaging, competitive game that has a high skill ceiling with a low barrier to entry and lovable characters. On the surface it is simple, but play it for a while and you'll understand why Overwatch exceeds the hype.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It deserves this for a few reasons.  It looks like Pixar quality, is the first game to do females right without forcing feminism but gives women role models that aren't total sleazes.  Blizzard is the master of making characters equal that are completely different.  This is the same, like they've done masterfully with starcraft they have made each individual character unique yet somehow able to defeat any other character given the time and situation.  That quality limits the total number of players, but 6v6 is a good start.  The game is complete bang for your buck at 39.99.  Console versions are 59.99 at the request of fans.  Blizzard didn't have to do this and release it for consoles as they are mainly a PC focused company, but they purchased the resources and charge 20 dollars more on consoles.  If you don't like it, don't buy it, but I think it's a reasonable request and it makes fans happy that they were willing to fold and get the game onto our televisions with a controller.Gameplay took me a couple of days.  At first I admit I was minorly dissapointed.  I then started going through the reccomended tutorials and learned how to use a couple of characters.  I started to notice subtle advantages like the last bullet doing more damage than the others.  Slowly I found out that characters had great advantages if played a certain way and focus on timings.  My friend logged in and we played on a team as Mercy and Sabastian.  The fun factor exploded and we had many joyous moments as we almost died but didn't and barely overtook the team in several matches.  It was really fun and seems like a game most would want to consider keeping in their library.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primarily my reasoning for this is due to how easy it is to jump into a game and have a unique experience every time. With that said, like all things, this game isn't without its flaws. Although having a solid gameplay experience, clever backstory and smooth interface, I still find it to be lacking in a few aspects such as maps and game modes.

Blizzard never marketed this game to have a campaign. If you saw any article pre-release, which was pretty hard to avoid, as advertisements were (and are) everywhere, you'd know that Overwatch is a multiplayer-only game. No one EVER said that this game was going to have a single player campaign. 2. People are complaining about the game having no competitive mode at launch. This is a valid point, although the strategy Blizzard went with isn't horrible. Many people gave feedback during the beta about how to improve the ranked and spectator systems, and Blizzard are still working on it. As a personal opinion, I don't mind that they launched the game without competitive ONLY because it is launching so soon after release; competitive's release is slated for the end of June. I've been having fun in quick play learning how the game works and how the characters play. Even if Overwatch did come with ranked at launch, I wouldn't have jumped into it without being adept at the game anyway. 3.  People are saying that the game should be F2P (free to play) but they must not know what that actually entails. F2P games give you a few free characters, with other characters on a rotation that shifts every so often, and the rest (often the best ones) are locked behind a paywall. Also behind this paywall are downloadable content and everything else. Blizzard has promised all upcoming DLC (characters, maps, etc) will be free. In the end, a one-time payment with all content included in the purchase is better than a F2P model. 4. I've read several reviews about the game being aimed at casual players and/or lacking content. These arguments are misguided. First off, this game has a lot of depth and a high skill ceiling. In the coming months, people are going to start finding new tech and new ways to use characters that will only push the ceiling higher. Like Rocket League or Super Smash Bros Melee, Overwatch can be a sort of party game that low-level players can enjoy, but also a game with huge esports potential. If Blizzard can listen to the community and get the ranked/spectator systems right, Overwatch could gain a large esports following. Second, the game has one unranked mode, training, custom games," and an ""arcade"" mode", which some suggest constitutes a lack of content. I agree that the game is lacking content, but what people fail to understand is that a ton of content =/= a ton of replayability. The core game mechanics of this game make every match feel fresh. The objectives are the same, but the way I've been approaching them is different every time. There are so many different viable team compositions and ways to play that Overwatch's replayability is massive. I'll use Rocket League again as an example, and this counts for all sports games as well: The maps are the same, the objectives are the same, but every match feels different because the games' mechanics allow the player to be creative in how they approach them, and it's past-paced and just plain fun. This is my unbiased opinion (I've never played a Blizzard game before and therefore have no company loyalty) and I hope this helps people to understand why this game is so good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RipTide098,positive,8,Overwatch is a fast paced, colorful, First Person Shooter, with a diverse cast of playable characters to play as.  The game is a lot of fun, but has a few glaring problems that keep it from being truly great. The first thing to talk about is, the game just looks amazing.

Environment designsOverwatch is a fast paced, colorful, First Person Shooter, with a diverse cast of playable characters to play as.  The game is a lot of fun, but has a few glaring problems that keep it from being truly great. The first thing to talk about is, the game just looks amazing. The fantastic art style and bright colors make every part of this game just stand out so well.  Environment designs have enough detail to make each area feel distinct and alive without feeling overly cluttered or distracting.  Character models look fantastic.  Each of the 21 characters look unique and yet are instantly recognizable at a glance, and every inch of them is bursting with character. In a world where games with muted grey brown as their only color have become the norm, it is nice to see colorful games that aren't afraid to be games again. Gameplay is fast and fun.  The maps are very well designed with plenty of large open areas for ranged engagements and many side paths to flank and get the drop on opponents.  Even within the same map areas can feel wildly different, with one section being a wide open combat arena and the next being tight corridors, and the rest being anywhere in-between.  The heroes all stand out gameplay wise as well, with even characters that are considered to be of the same class playing completely different.  The diversity of skills and weapons available from the cast of heroes is enough to keep the game from ever feeling stale.  Some may complain about the lack of customization, but I for one, prefer the massive differences form class to class than the minor differences from load out to load out. Now to the bad parts, the game is a little content light.  There are only three real different game types and a forth that is just a combination of two of the others.  There could have been a few more on launch, even just adding a fully fleshed out death match style game mode would have gone a long way to remove this as a concern.  Though to be fair the large roster of heroes does do a bit to cover for this, personally I would rather extra characters to an extra game mode or a few maps. Now for my biggest problem with the game, the free to play style loot system.  The slow rate of gaining crates, the random factor ensuring you have virtually no chance for getting items you want, the high rate of duplicate items, and the low 20% of value credit gain from said duplicates all add up to make this system just terrible.  Even though all the items are purely cosmetic, this system is designed to trick people into spending more than they want to and does not in any way belong in a full price game. Over all Overwatch is a fun game that looks great and is a joy to play.  Right now thought, it is held back by its lack of diversity in game modes and atrocious free to play loot system.  If you can wait for the additional free content that is coming, and can look past the free to play elements, it is defiantly worth the cost though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That being said, the game is solid. Graphics are cartoonish and stylish, especially noticeable is that you will always understand what is going on on your screen and that's really important in a game like this. Content-wise there is not so much right now but I do think that is not a real problem, first because Blizzard is always updating their games, second because what is important is the gameplay.Gameplay-wise is where Overwatch shines the most. Fast-paced, skill-based and team compositions are fundamental aspects of the game, so it is highly recommended to play with friends. Each character feels unique and needs a different degree of training to be properly used, also the idea that you can swap characters during the match makes counter attacks much easier and avoids unnecessary boredom from people who cannot use that specific hero, if you are not good, you just change to someone more suited and go right back into the action. Apart from balanced issues (get ready to be headshoted everywhere by Hanzos in a few weeks) one problem is the absence of the sprint button for all heroes (apart Soldier 76), this leads to long walking times, but at the same time," it allows to be careful to engage because you cannot run so quickly off the action. Maps are pretty easy to memorize but have some nice ""twists""", like certain areas can be access quicker only by some heroes," increasingly the importance of a balance team.I still have to understand how Blizzard was able to develop a game that feels ""easy"" in both the mechanics and the settings while still having a lot of depth", the game designers are pretty good at their jobs I would say,Overall, Overwatch feels like a really polished game. Matchmaking is fast (only one time had connections problem and always zero lag at day one). Grab a couple of friends and jump in, this game will stay on the market for a long time so no worries about new content.ps:I guess there is no need to say how user reviews with score 0 are useless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SSSamus,positive,9,Overwatch is probably the most fun I've had with a shooter in, well, forever. Seriously.

Seriously. Now, this isn't saying all that much, as I'm only 15 and I'm generally not a huge fan of FPS titles, but this is a really, really fun game. For those of you who just want my score and a quick summary, I won't make you scroll down to the bottom of the post, here you go:9.5/10 Overwatch, is fun, frantic, and charming, with some of the best balancing I've ever seen in a shooter," and incredibly well crafted ""easy to learn"," hard to master"" gameplay. There are a couple of characters that are no fun whatsoever to try and fight", and the game is slightly lacking in content at launch, but knowing how much effort Blizzard puts into the longevity of their games, I'm sure these issues will be resolved, and we'll be left with one of the best arena shooters ever made.Presentation: This game looks fantastic. The graphics are great, the art style is unique and eye catching, and it's extremely well optimized, at least on PC. The thing that really stood out to me, however, is the level of detail put into the environments that bring them to life. There are semi-destructible vending machines and arcade cabinets, little references to other Blizzard titles, and even a few games of Hearthstone left running (I would assume at Rank 20, as everyone is still running silverback patriarch). Props to blizzard on some of the most amazing looking maps in a game to date.Gameplay: Ah yes, the most important thing in any shooter, and I'm happy to say that this is perhaps Overwatch's strongest aspect. Everything is fast and fluid, the maps and team sizes are designed in such a way that you feel like you're having an impact but never that you lost because of one bad player, the level design is great and gives each hero unique ways of traversing the map, and I hardly ever feel as if I'm just running into a kill trap over and over without a way to do something about it. The only thing I would suggest in this category is that occasionally it feels as if one team has advantage over another simply based on level layout, usually with the payload matches.Balancing: Overwatch is incredibly well balanced, which is impressive given that it just came out. Many heroes are direct counters to each other, so that one player can't dominate the match. It's extremely well thought out. Probably my only complaint in this area is Bastion, who needs a really big nerf very soon. His DPS is insane, and he can wipe out an entire team in about 6 seconds. But overall, the game feels very fair.Content: My only real problem with the game, but even this I'm not that worried about. There are quite a few modes I'd like to see, as well as better friend options, and given how cool the game's lore looks, I'd love to see a singleplayer or co-op campaign introduced sometime down the road. But, knowing blizzard and how well the handle DLC and expansions, I'm confident we'll soon have more content than we know what to do with. Overall, Overwatch has a ridiculous amount of potential, and a developer who I know is willing to explore that potential. Buckle in, everybody. We're in for one hell of a ride.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to try the open beta prior to release after hearing the hype around the game, I was soon hooked. Overwatch is one of the most solid games I have played at launch and of of the most enjoyable multiplayer games I have played. The graphics while not mind blowing are still beautiful and the art direction has the Blizzard charm that they are known for.  All the character play differently from one another and are fun to play with enjoyable personalities to boot. the gun play is arcade like  but in a good way, all the mechanics are well balanced among the 21 heroes at lunch. My only issue with the game as of right now is map variety and game mode variety. None of the maps are bad but since they are small compared to other fps games it would be nice to have more locations. It would also be nice to see some more game modes down the road maybe ctf  of something similar to conquest with slightly larger maps. My issues with the game are minor gripes and are something that will be addressed as the months and years roll around. I encourage many people to purchase the game, particularly on pc since the base game is 40 bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However to simply call the game a first person shooter would be a disservice. Blizzard has crafted a game in this emergent genre of 'hero shooters/arena shooters; that borrows the best ideas from other games in the genre like Team Fortress 2. Blizzard has put their own spin on it to make it a fresh experience. The art style is fantastic too and is primed for a feature length film. It really is some gorgeous stuff and I don't think its an stretch to say that the visuals themselves would look at home in a Pixar film. The performance is rock solid as well. The game has been incredibly well optimized and features one of the most robust suites of options I have seen in a PC game. This feels like it was built from the ground up for PC. You can customize damned near any key. You also can adjust key-bindings at the hero level. Yup, you have a set of key-bindings for each of the 21 heroes currently in the game. You can also customize the shape, and color of the on screen reticle. Its this attention to detail that shows in just about every area of the game. Overwatch centers its focus on its heroes and how their abilities can be used with and against other heroes. Its focus on team composition and allowing you to swap heroes gives the game incredible depth and an underlying layer of player choice and strategy. The game features a variety of modes such as training, practices vs. AI, as well as quick play. Within these modes the actual game types themselves can consist of things like payload (familiar to fans of TF2), capture point and King of the hill style matches. One of the criticisms leveled against the game is lack of content. I would agree with this statement if it was in regards to the number of modes themselves. But not every game needs a single player campaign. I feel that with the number of heroes on display here," a single player campaign would have diluted the multiplayer experience. Jeff Kaplan of Blizzard also pointed out that support heroes like Mercy would be tough to work into a single player campaign because of their nature as support heroes. I would like to see more modes added over time. Perhaps Capture the flag. I don't think Team Death-match would fit well either. Blizzard has smartly decided to de-emphasize kills and kdr in favor of promoting team play. What is odd however is that the majority of the 'play of the game' are from people/heroes who rack up a lot of kills. The game features a commendation system which on its own doesn't really mean much. But it can be nice to get commendations from your team mates if you do a good job of healing. It also has things like ""damage blocked."" It is a way of saying hey look how well you did your job", or performed your role. The game features a progression system that gives you a loot box when you level up. These drops can be anything ranging from currency to skins, avatars, sprays, voice lines or victory poses. Its all superfluous but it is a nice way of customizing your character and making it your own. The game does have micro-transactions but these are only for loot boxes which are at the end of the day cosmetic stuff and don't impact the game itself. My initial concern is that the more games you play the higher the chance you will get duplicates from loot boxes. Fortunately those duplicates  do reward you gold which can then be used towards something else you don't have. In the end Overwatch is a fantastic well crafted game despite needing a few more modes. Blizzard have created a solid platform to build upon and have stated that future heroes and maps will be free which is very welcome indeed. Multiplayer only games can struggle to find success. Overwatch however has enough depth in its gameplay that it never felt repetitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game has the perfect amount of content right now.  21 diverse heroes all with immense strategic depth.  There are 12 maps," and I haven't played any of them thinking ""this map is meh"," I don't like it when it comes up.""  They are all amazing.  Each part of a map is a strategic opportunity for a hero.  There are 3 game modes.  This is an excellent recipe for a COMPETITIVE game---which is exactly what Overwatch is.  In a competitive game", you don't want 10 different game modes and 30 different maps.  With that much content, it is hard to learn map layouts and game modes and their respective strategies.  And by learn," I'm not talking casual learning where you feel like you know the game pretty well after several hours of play.  I'm talking about hundreds of hours of play on each map and each game mode and with each hero.  This is how you are supposed to approach competitive games.  You need to embrace the ""lack of variety"" (although Overwatch is the polar opposite of lack of variety) and instead focus on being better than everyone else at maps", modes, heroes, and other elements of the game.  A good reference for this concept is League of Legends.  That game has been out since 2009 and for mainstream competitive play (so not counting Twisted Treeline) there is only one map and one game mode---and that is a large part of LoL's competitive success. People also complain that this game has no single player element.  Well it actually does.  The Practice Range.  It's a great place to study a hero's mechanics.  This is a must for a competitive game.  What this game doesn't have is a single player campaign.  It doesn't need one in my opinion, however if Blizzard added one in the future I wouldn't complain.  I know it'd be pretty dope.Now for the review of the game itself.  Not going to spend much time here.  It's extremely fun.  The replay value is insanely high (per the first paragraph).  Each hero is very unique and plays in their own way.  You can dump hundreds of hours into a hero and will still need to work on other heroes, since the game is designed to encourage switching heroes mid-game depending on the situation at hand.  Even if that's not the case, you will want to benefit from a diverse team so only sticking with one or two heroes will still stifle your playing potential.  The gameplay is very fun and diverse as well.  No two matches feel alike. I have found nothing wrong with this game.  Absolutely nothing.  I like and respect Blizzard but I'm not a fanboy by any stretch of the imagination.  Their only other games I've played are Diablo III, and was only into that for a couple months (really really fun game though), and Hearthstone.  As a competitive character based game, yes some of the heroes are annoying as heck to play against but this isn't something that's wrong with the game.  This is present is any game like this, League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, Team Fortress 2, you name it. So I'm just going to list all the generic good stuff about this game that you are probably here wondering:- Graphics/Art Style (the art style and character design is what drew me to this game).-Gameplay-Music/Sound (really love the soundtrack, a lot.  I'm a sucker for game soundtracks)-Replay value-Honestly, any other game review parameter you can think of, this game meets it. Overall this game definitely warrants all the hype.  If you're still on the fence then I guess this just aint a game for you OR you should just watch more gameplay videos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weng,positive,9,After waiting over two years for this game I can finally say the wait and excitement paid off. I've never really played a Blizzard game before this as they've never produced anything that really has much appeal to me but here Blizzard have created something that I can finally sink well over 1000 hours into.

I've never really played a Blizzard game before this as they've never produced anything that really has much appeal to me but here Blizzard have created something that I can finally sink well over 1000 hours into. The gameplay is fun, fast and frantic and there's never a dull moment. The game is also quite cheap when compared to most AAA titles these days, the game is about £30 with £40 for the special addition. On top of this the micro transaction system is perfectly done with them being completely optional for those who want to get cosmetic items fast. My only gripe with the game is that there is no voting system currently in game so getting rid of an afk person or mic spammer is near impossible. There is also a strange leavers penalty system that I don't feel belongs in the quick play section of this game as it feels very drop in, drop out, I can understand why it would be there in competitive mode but not in the casual ones. I myself am also experiencing strange connection issues where I suddenly lose connection to the server but this seems to be happening to only a small amount of people and Blizzard have stated they are working on a fix. TL:DR - Games good, buy it, like, right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The team-play is fantastic, the lore and heroes are amazingly interesting and robust, and the gameplay is still riveting literally hundreds of games later. Blizzard has knocked it out of the park with this game. And by the way, he's not a monkey, he's a scientist.
May 24, 2016,J33P3R5_CR33P3R,10,This game is amazing and another homerun for Blizzard. It looks fantastic on all systems, is perfectly balanced, and has a character for every style of play. With a focus on a level playing field, the game is more about skill and hero choice than who has the better gear (as all unlocks are cosmetics only). With promised free heros and maps on the horizon, this is a must own.
May 30, 2016,zzzsheepyzzz,8,two things remain constant for this game: it can be very fun and very addicting.The characters and team dynamic allow for many different revisions in strategy as well as having the ability to switch characters within the same match allows for a lot of customization.

Itwo things remain constant for this game: it can be very fun and very addicting.The characters and team dynamic allow for many different revisions in strategy as well as having the ability to switch characters within the same match allows for a lot of customization. A lot of time and care went into designing the characters and levels for this the game should be very much commended. I especially love the voice acting and artwork throughout. The game, however feels incomplete. To me, having the story branch out through internet articles and youtube videos is interesting, but also seems... lazy as opposed to having a campaign style story line, or any single player for that matter. I understand that the game seems to be catered towards Esports, and if that is the intent, it has been doing a tremendous job at that. This game, as it stands, reeks of meta-game, and for the style of play that includes small tinkering to your strategy and game style to optimize your win chances this game is fantastic. You basically roll through the same maps and game types over and over again and this becomes apparent after the first few weeks of gameplay (depending on how much you play). It's a fun game, but it's limited. However I feel that I have gotten my money's worth with the gameplay that has been released. I give this an 8/10 hoping that new content will continue to come.

So basically does what is supposed to do. It is not a game changing in any way. From that perspective it couldn't been worst because nobody knows how is going to be before the end of the year. It can change for better or not change at all, if that is the case I will be very disappointed, thus making it a just-for-the-moment experience. Blizzard is risking a lot with this game at the same time we are too by putting our money into it. So the game is a bomb just hope for the best to keep it out of our side because we don't know when is going to explode.

Since launch, I have put in more hours than I am willing to admit and I am very happy to see this game come to life with such strong community and hopefully developer support. From here, everything is set in motion for overwatch to both become a popular PC game as well as an eSport title - it comes down to how Blizzard will handle future updates, the inevitable cheaters (they already announced a zero tolerance policy so hackers are banned forever, no excuse) and many other aspects that make a good game great. The other part I am REALLY happy about is the pay wall"". If this was a free2play title", we would see a huge amount of brazillians and peruvians ruining our games (i.e. dota 2, league, etc). This way, you get decent players and less of a chance of hackers buying 20 copies of the games (i.e. csgo steam sales). tl;dr: great game, get it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's easily my favorite team shooter. While you can't make your own loadout, the number of unique skills across the characters makes it so that there's more depth than any game in this genre. You're picking from 21 sets of skills and traits that are each meticulously balanced, and no two play alike. Even within the same category of hero, each one can be completely different. As far as innovation, aren't the ultimate abilities innovative enough? They're so varied and constantly change the flow of combat, making any encounter unpredictable and never boring. Could someone unleash an ultimate that wipes your entire team if you're not prepared? On top of this, the game has an insane level of detail put into each character's backstory. It's fun to simply be these characters, and it makes me eager to see these characters used in games in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was unsure about this game until I played open beta - I even let my closed beta invite slip since I was preoccupied elsewhere. But after playing open beta - I couldn't wait for the game to be released. It's just a lot of fun. Most of the heroes are very easy to play - although this is also complimented by the fact that how well you perform depends drastically on your skill. I think this works well for both casual players as well as more serious competitive players. I can't see how people are complaining about lack of content. It's a blizzard game - this is only just launch and it has shipped with a whole bunch of maps and heroes. With more coming in the future. Some people were under the impression that the game would release with more content than in beta. Of course developers are not likely to be trying to push out new content than their BETA version of the game - being busy with bug fixing and extra polishing (after all that is the purpose of a beta).Another negative point that really annoyed me was a whole bunch of people who gave it lower scores as it had no single player or campaign. I find this on par with someone complaining about TF2, CSGO, LOL etc. as having no single player campaign - it's just ridiciously. There are a ton of multiplayer games only - I could understand people complaining about this in the days of dial up; but otherwise all I can say is - if you're looking for a single player game then of course this game isn't for that. A few reviews and people also are under the impression that all the heroes are OP and it only takes one ultimate etc. for automatic kills. To be honest, I felt the same way when I started. But eventually you hopefully realize that different heroes have different counters. And that avoiding certain ultimates is not that hard. I mean - this is just an example - if you ever felt that Pharah's ult is OP; then you should try play her. Her ult leaves you completely vulnerable and covering only moderate-small spaces.That's not to say the game is perfectly balanced obviously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Would you like beeing on the offence with one useless guy on the team? NO YOU WOULD NOT. Thats like asking for SC2 to be a F2P game where you must unlock units for your faction. IT IS THE STUPIDEST IDEA EVER! 40$ ain't even much when you get all future updates and heroes for free. CHAPTER 3 ""But it is micro transactions in the game!!!111!!1! derp derp""Is it? I didn't even notice. It maybe because i don't give a rats arse about skins and voice-packs that you can unlock for free just playing the game. ""Oh **** i paid to enter the soccer club"," but now i need to buy blue shoes because i want blue shoes? Why can't i get the custom shoes and shirts and **** for free now!?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frigidman,positive,8,Overwatch is Blizzard's first new IP in quite a long time, and boy did they succeed. As a shooter, Overwatch has a little bit for everyone. I almost guarantee that anyone who plays it will enjoy at least one of the many different characters it has to offer. Whether you enjoy soaring through the skies as Pharah, healing and reviving teammates as Mercy, playing a more typical FPS characterOverwatch is Blizzard's first new IP in quite a long time, and boy did they succeed. As a shooter, Overwatch has a little bit for everyone. I almost guarantee that anyone who plays it will enjoy at least one of the many different characters it has to offer. Whether you enjoy soaring through the skies as Pharah, healing and reviving teammates as Mercy, playing a more typical FPS character like Soldier 76, or just sitting in place as a robotic turret holding down your mouse button for hours... You will find one at least. In terms of content, Overwatch has four gamemodes in its standard quick play (Capture the point, King of the hill, Payload, and a Point-Payload hybrid), a vs. AI mode, custom lobbies, and a mode that changes each week which features crazy or fun rules on standard gameplay. And Blizzard has stated to expect a ranked mode sometime in mid-late June. In terms of microtransactions, those are purely for cosmetics, so they hinder the game in no way. You'll never be disadvantaged against someone who bought 50 loot boxes... unless you get distracted by their pretty skins... Plus Blizzard has stated all future maps and characters will be free upon release. I would definitely recommend Overwatch to anyone in the market for a good FPS, or even just a fun as hell game to play with your friends. With the standard edition only being $40, the pricing isn't that bad. If you fear there is too little content, I would say the game's replayability more than makes up for it as I have yet to be bored at all while playing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once you start to incorporate some basic team work and stop trying to solo your way through then some really fun mechanics open up; the meta is also fun with the ability to swap characters in and out at a moments notice to overcome team combos your enemy throws up.I've always felt that FPS games couldn't hold my attention for long enough due to a few basic things which became standard (Not having a level playing field being a big problem...due to one thing or another.) In this once you learn all the characters fairly well (think of it as learning all the tricks with each weapon.) the  playing field is then level, this will only take 10-20 hours depending on your familiarity with moba like character systems.Trust me if you grew up playing DOOM on a floppy disk and know what a .wad is and what it felt like to destroy a whole team with a redeemer blast, then this game is well worth trying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the diverse cast of fun and colorful characters from across the world, to the intriguing mythos of the surrounding global catastrophe, the game is incredible, easy to play, hard to master, and insanely fun for players of all skill levels. Seasoned vets will be intrigued by finding strategies to take down even the toughest of heros, learning each character and their strengths and weaknesses, while new players will be attracted by the ease of play, and just straight up fun. there is one flaw though, and this is the flaw that is always with this kind of team based shooter, and that is the Team Fortress curse as i call it:4 tank players,no medics,2 offensive players. this is every team ever and that's because everyone wants to be the big robot that wrecks everything, and no one wants to be supports. The way Overwatch attempts to fix this is by offering kick-ass supports that even early learners can play and that actually function as viable characters.

As far as reasonable expectations go, Overwatch is a damn fine steak, though. The hero roster is great, the maps are well designed, the gameplay is very fluid and satisfying. Although there could be more game modes or some extra dynamic events on the maps, the package is quite solid as it is. While cosmetic offerings do not come fast by leveling, you hardly need more than one (favorite) skin/voice line/spray for any character.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the worse reviews mention the lack of content, there are only 21 heroes and 12 maps and the price is 40$. But as far as i know Blizzard said there will be contentupdates which will be free. If youre not supe hyped you probably should just maybe wait a bit and see how the game expands. You also should reconsider tho buy this game if you plan to solo-que, teamplay is really important in Ow so you probably will get steamrolled a lot by premate-teams. I didnt play that much solo, but i can say it happens like every 10 matches.(easy solution: just search for people on ts-servers or somewhere else.) Overall i think Overwatch is a well polished game with a fresh idea and even with good lore, plus the lack of content will be solved over time. (btw, i think its really sad that people give Ow a 0 because they think 98 is to much and blizzard payed for the reviews," or because they are ""dying over and over again to other players who obviously aren't anymore skilled than you"" or because its to fast for their taste)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The movement is awesome and game play is intense. I saw some people complain of it being slow? That sounds ridiculous to me, I feel like this game is a lot faster than other FPS's out there (not. incl. Arena Shooters).

People quote Team Fortress 2 being free to play, but what most people seem to forget is that Team Fortress 2 was originally not free to play.  Team Fortress 2 also had just as many single player options as Overwatch does. I have a lot of fun playing this game. The characters are diverse and the maps are generally well designed. The only complaints I have is that a few characters/maps need to be balanced a little. Sometimes when you're attacking a point that has a big chokepoint, it's almost impossible to get through when there's 2 turrets and 2 bastions Guarding the entrance. It's still a lot of fun trying to push through it though, so I can't even truly complain about that. Overall the game is well made and a lot of fun.

I particularly love how Blizzard was able to use ideas from MOBA style games and flawlessly blend them into a regular team fps. All of the characters are unique in both their appearance and their play style making every game you play a different experience (in a good way). Negatives: Now with (almost) every game there is at least one negative and despite how crazy fun the multiplayer madness may be, it's still just multiplayer with not much of a backstory. Now i'm not just complaining about the fact that there is no story mode to play through I am referring to a lack of overall backstory in the game in general. Now of course you can always use sources like wiki and polygon's timeline (definitely recommend the timeline) to get the story but that is unfortunately the only way. Now don't let this discourage you to much because the game is still super fun to play and the gameplay does not get hurt by this but it is a feature that a lot of people wish were there. Verdict: 9/10. A must buy for any fan of fps multiplayer. The lack of story content is not enough to make this game not worth the price of admission and you will certainly agree after you hit your 100th hour of gameplay with no sign of slowing down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whatever their reasons, they are entitled to their opinion. The price may seem a bit steep for what there is, but it's also important to consider that every single map and character released in the future will be free, so that makes it worth it. The characters and worlds are amazing: each one feels unique and well-balanced. The visuals are gorgeous: It's not just another generic gritty brown military shooter. The music is great: it feels epic and inspiring. Overall, if you like team-based FPS games where teamwork actually matters, then you should play it.

Maybe for most, the answer is all those things but for me, its about the personality each character holds.There stories that just scream to us for more exploration of Blizzards beautiful world they have created. On launch day most of us players can recall that Overwatch had a Huge shortage of content," being the only option for players to play was ""quick play""", but that was all we needed to be hooked into the game. Though what we didn't realize is that the story would soon grasp us and claw at our minds to learn more. 21 hero's (Playable Characters) on launch day with more to come, a character for everybody seemed to fit the Blizzard motto. Each character well equiped with very well crafted abilities, stylized looks, with most importantly there very own unique personality. Given that the game play feels damn near flawless its no wonder a game like Overwatch grew to be so successful, but that's not where this game shines its brightest, at least not in its entirety. Blizzard Entertainment actually put forth the effort to create a story on there Competitive Based FPS. Though there are no single player campaign element to the game Blizzard still continues consistently gives us information on the universe and characters of Overwatch, Through comic shorts or there cinematic shorts which always perks the interest of all fans of the Overwatch universe. Seeing these consistent updates and new content being added to Overwatch one might think there is a budgeting issue within there team or some sort of annoying DLC available for purchase within the Overwatch game/website, well Im here to reassure you that is not the case. Everything that is Overwatch you can get with just one Purchase of the main game, though there are micro-transactions in game you may only purchase skins in game that you may still unlock via in game currency. This effectively lets Overwatch have a very respectable and financially profitable business model that the fans and I have grown to love.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pros:-◾-Beautiful aesthetic, impressive sound design and animations as well as amazing character and level designs.◾-Very unique playstyle for each character out of the 21 available now, there are classes (tank, support, offense, defense) like in all team-based arena shooters but even within each class every character feels like a whole different beast to learn and master.◾-Impressive assortment of cosmetics, character skins, player icons, sprays (you can put them on walls in-game), character intros, emotes and victory poses for every character.◾-Blizzard seal of quality, game is super polished, had a very smooth launch and plays like magic with zero glitches or problems (there were few glitches in open Beta but they are gone now), expect long years of support and free content as well, after all Blizzard still release patches for their decade old games like Diablo 2 and Starcraft: Broodwar. Cons:-◾-Few gameplay modes, sure you can play custom and Brawl where the rules can be dramatically changed but still in Quick Play (the main gameplay mode) there are only three gameplay modes (Point Capture, Payload and Assault) and one Hybrid, it would have been great if the game released with more modes but they surely will add more in the coming updates.◾-Some game systems could use a bit of tweaking like Play of the Game (a cool feature that saves and replays the best moment in the game for everyone to watch), a lot of times it's something awesome and exciting, other times it's mundane and even nonsensical and comical (like showing the Engineer Torbjörn dead on the floor while his turret is doing all the kills), a few tweaks to the algorithms of how PotG is selected would prevent such silly things from happening. Two last things regarding the idiots panning the for the most stupid and retarded reasons, all of the cosmetic stuff in the game you can earn by just playing and leveling up, if you are impatient you can buy extra loot chests to get stuff faster, but nothing obliges you to do so, basically don't listen to the idiots who are whining about loot boxes shop, it's 100% optional and the game offers loot boxes at a steady rate every level up (there is no level cap, level exp requirements flatline at lv.22 and reset every 100 levels), Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer used the same exact system and it worked great, that money will help keep the game alive for years and support all the costs of adding new free heroes, new maps, play modes and features  (and pay server maintenance costs), i don't see any reason whatsoever to complain about the loot boxes shop, unless you just want to troll. 2nd, i can't believe this site still allows zero score reviews, it is beyond ridiculous how some people acting like 5 years old bullies who might not have even bought or played the game can just write a pile of hateful crap and it somehow that **** counts as a review, the one affected most negatively by this utter lack of criteria for reviews is actually the site itself. If you like Team-based arena shooters, a big fan of Blizzard games or just want to try a multiplayer game that's fun, polished and addicting go buy this game right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jmc8888,positive,10,Lots of idiots with agendas judging the game and dropping the score unfairly. Or the usual idiot that scores games a zero because he wants to negate someone's 10. You can usually tell by the fact these idiots say it's a full priced game... $39.99 is NOT full priced. But they are morons and again they have an agenda.I don't play Blizzard's other games, they just aren't for me. ButLots of idiots with agendas judging the game and dropping the score unfairly.

But they are morons and again they have an agenda. I don't play Blizzard's other games, they just aren't for me. But for what they are, they are quality. This game IS like Team Fortress 2, but new and fresh. If you liked TF2, you'll like this. It's like Payload and Capture point. This game is fun, polished, and quite simply breathtaking. So many twists and turns can happen in a match your jaw will drop. You think you are winning, nope, someone tactically uses one of their abilities, and bam... the momentum flips. Then it flips again, then again. This IS Overwatch. Amazing game, easy to get into, and fun. Get hooked and you'll be coming back for more... and more... and more. This game fills a great gap that has been overlooked by other FPS games (which I love too). Again, this game is ultra polished. With 21 characters, you'd think it might not mesh. Wrong. This game meshes, and so many characters are made so teammates can piggyback off your abilities to create one helluva dynamic game. Also with so many characters you can easily switch to one to tactically neuter someone on the other team and even things up. 12 maps have all sorts of crazy pathways.  They are not small maps, is a TF2 payload map small?  I don't think so. Oh you play Winston, jumping all around going APE taking out the other teams support healing character like Mercy, well you can place down that shield and your teammates have a few seconds to stand in it laying waste to those outside it. Or you can have a Reinhardt with his shield up and you stand behind it laying waste and slowly advancing to the control point or shielding you to some nook and cranny pathway to get behind the enemy. Tracer can warp in front of Reinhardt throw her bomb and use the playback (or whatever) ability and warp back behind the shield.  Teamwork definitely works in this game. You have Junkrat who is like Team Fortress 2's Demoman. Except he also has a super ability which is like a big explosive wheel that you can drive into your enemies. But of course they can shoot it a few times and destroy it.  I've taken out an entire team multiple times before with that explosive wheel.  Talk about a momentum flip. You have Torbjorn which is like TF2's Engineer, except instead of building a dispenser and trying to constantly upgrade it as you build a turret, you can upgrade the turret easily without any spare metal and let it be while you are using your molten lead gun. Then you can use your super ability which upgrades you and the turret to level 3 laying waste for about 20 seconds. You even got D.VA which looks like a Japanese Mecha whose super bunny nuke explosion super ability is great. If the mecha gets damaged, you can eject (or when charged up that nuke a real momentum flip) and then you can run around still alive and if you get a few hits, you can Titanfall another Mech really fast. Mercy can heal and is a great asset.  She can also raise an entire team from the dead. This game has so many play styles via it's characters it's insane. I can understand people trying one or two characters and saying it's not for them because they didn't know what they were doing and lost, but these people really didn't give the game a chance. Right now I feel like I got 5 or 6 characters down and each one is different and fun. So many other characters to master along the way. People that complain about leveling up, getting loot packs (which is the only thing you get from leveling up), and getting COSMETIC items that have NO BEARING on play and that some people can buy them are morons. This does not mean F2P, only morons think so. So check the low scores. They are from morons who don't know what the hell they are talking about. They think this is F2P,  say it's Full Priced, and bag about online only games. Or they barely played the beta. They overlook the FACT that this game will be getting FREE modes, FREE characters, and FREE maps. All for $39.99 This game is going to be around for a long time, and the content will only grow. Get in now, enjoy the game, and enjoy the content drops as they come. It's a 10 because it does exactly what you hope such a game would be. It does it well, very polished, and free stuff will keep it fresh for years to come. Most importantly, it's fun. Some people just can't accept games that are online focused.  They don't care if free maps and characters are coming.  They hate on RB6: Siege.  They hate on SW:BF because it was made in less time then your average CoD but COMPLETELY new.  They hate because there's no SP.  They forget to look at what the game IS! People that hate on this game are going to look really stupid soon. Like people who didn't see the 08 Economic crisis coming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One big thing that dropped it's rating for me as well is the lack of progression, which is an understatement. There is literally none. Levelling gets you loot crates which give you new cosmetics, that's literally it. But as I said before it has to be one of the best shooters I have ever played in terms of gameplay, not only does everything work, but it works so well together, they also fixed the few overpowered things from the beta, so no real issues in terms of balancing. If you like FPS games you would be insane not buying this, if you don't like FPS games I am confident this is the FPS that will change your mind!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ExpositionFairy,positive,8,A surprisingly great take on FPS by Blizzard which, in my opinion, lives up to the hype. Here's why: Pros:- The game is easy to get into, yet hard to master. There are characters suited to all kinds and levels of playstyles - which I think is great! Each character feels unique to play, offering a diversity of experiences.- To win in Overwatch, you need to have a good understandingA surprisingly great take on FPS by Blizzard which, in my opinion, lives up to the hype. Here's why: Pros:- The game is easy to get into, yet hard to master. There are characters suited to all kinds and levels of playstyles - which I think is great! Each character feels unique to play, offering a diversity of experiences.- To win in Overwatch, you need to have a good understanding of how characters work together or against each other tactically, and how team comps compare to each other, as well as how you can strategically use the map to your advantage. However, your reflexes also make a contribution - for example, if you're good at aiming AND strategy, you can really shine with a hero like Tracer. Overwatch has just the right balance between these two contributing factors - it's not like a MOBA where almost everything is decided by tactics; and it's not CS:GO where aim is the largest influence.- Because games are quite short, losses generally don't feel punishing, yet winning can be very exciting.- When compared to a MOBA or a game like CS:GO, where your previous success has an influence on your future success (e.g. whether you have enough money to buy the items you need), in Overwatch this factor is eliminated completely, making last-minute comebacks possible and extremely satisfying.- Overwatch's pay-to-play model guarantees that there will be no game-breaking factors in the future, as well as free content updates in the future as stated by the developers. It also ensures that people will be less prone to purchase new accounts in the future and break the game for newcomers. Finally, the P2P model holds a promise of a better community. Cons:- Netcode. In my opinion, this is the game's biggest issue at the moment. Currently, issues where you receive damage after you are already in cover or have used an escape ability are quite frequent. Blizzard will certainly have to do something about this when it comes to ranked play.- Ranked play. It has not been released as of yet, so it is not fair to judge on this yet; however, if ranked is anything like the closed beta was, it will certainly need revisions if Overwatch wants to see a future in e-sports. Neutral:- The game is very fast-paced, which to some will feel very fun, yet to others may feel overwhelming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mewthree,positive,8,When you think about Blizzard, two words come into mind: polish and optimization. This is particularly true for Overwatch. The game runs absolutely fantastically and the gameplay feels very satisfying, responsive and smooth. On top of that, the game has a lot of attention to detail with the maps, sounds and heroes. It's easy to miss how much work has gone into the polish and not give itWhen you think about Blizzard, two words come into mind: polish and optimization. This is particularly true for Overwatch. The game runs absolutely fantastically and the gameplay feels very satisfying, responsive and smooth. On top of that, the game has a lot of attention to detail with the maps, sounds and heroes. It's easy to miss how much work has gone into the polish and not give it the credit it deserves. One of the best things about the game is its heroes. They are all so unique and very fun to play. I honestly don't dislike any of them. Some balancing still needs to be done, but the game is surprisingly balanced, considering it just came out. But I am a bit disappointed in the amount of mechanical skill required to play most of the heroes. Luckily, there's still a lot of skill involved in the game, strategic-wise. The heroes aren't the only thing that's expertly crafted, though. The map design is superb. Not once have I felt frustrated because of the maps during my 30 hours of playtime. Unfortunately, there are some aspects of the game that are causing a great deal of controversy. First off, is the game worth $40? This really depends on your definition. If you look at the amount of content (btw, there's 3 game modes, not 2, and yes, although two of them appear to be similar, they play out very differently) and compare it to some other games, the price seems way too high. On the other hand, if you look at the amount of fun you're having and how many hours you can happily spend with the game, $40 feels like a bargain. In the end, it's everyone's own choice whether the game is worth it or not. That said, you do get all of the upcoming content for free when you have the game. This includes competitive mode (=ranked), new maps, game modes and heroes. Knowing Blizzard, there will be a lot of content and support coming from them, but we're essentially paying for content that's not (yet) there. Nonetheless, it is absolutely mindless to give the game 0/10 because it is multiplayer only and doesn't have a lot of content. Look at CS:GO and LoL, for example. Not a lot of content there, but there's TONS of players who have thousands of hours spent in the game. Granted, the skill ceiling in Overwatch may not be quite as high, but the game is clearly designed to be an esport. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. The progression system is essentially about lootboxes that grant you skins, voice lines, sprays etc. I can see this not being to everyone's liking, but personally, I like it. It does seem like a F2P mechanic, especially with the micro-transactions, but contrary to some people's opinion, the game isn't a F2P game, nor should it be. Bear in mind that everything in the game is obtainable without real money AND you get all the heroes (including the upcoming ones) instantly for free. For the record, you can not buy anything that helps you in the game in any way. It's all just cosmetic. In the end, the game is a lot of fun and it's very addicting. The amount of polish and detail is really impressive, but unfortunately we're paying for content that isn't yet there and the mechanical skill required is a bit underwhelming so I have to give it an 8/10. Still, I'd imagine that somewhere in the future, when more content has been released, the game might deserve a 9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The balance is pretty good in the main game, and if you're not into a balanced shooter you can hop unto the weekly brawl which uses various modifiers to create a new and entertaining gamemode every week. I've seen a lot of people complain for the lack of maps or gamemodes, and honestly as to this point I have no complaints over the amount of content in this game. Just keep in mind that this is a multiplayer only game and I don't believe that a lack of a story mode is a good enough argument against this game. Nobody complains about the lack of a singleplayer in other competitive shooters and besides, the way the game is designed I don't believe a singleplayer mode could actually be implemented well. Overall, I'll give Overwatch 9/10. I trust Blizzard will update this game adding new heroes and maps constantly as they've promised, but the ability to purchase loot boxes just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. That said there is no advantage to skins or in-game currency so it is in no way P2W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well I am so glad that I downloaded the beta and got to play because this game is EPIC! i love shooters like bf/cod and I absolutely looooove this game and here's why.1. the mechanics/movement/ are superb in my opinion. all the characters play/feel different since they are all differentI played the battleborn beta and didn't like it so I came in thinking that OW would be just as bad. Well I am so glad that I downloaded the beta and got to play because this game is EPIC! i love shooters like bf/cod and I absolutely looooove this game and here's why.1. the mechanics/movement/ are superb in my opinion. all the characters play/feel different since they are all different sizes and have different abilities so there is a character for everyone, which brings me to my second point.2. Diversity. the fact that i can choose from 21 completely different characters that have different looks, feels, abilities, play styles is probably one of the best features about this game. your not just a generic soldier amongst other generic soldiers, each character was well thought out by blizzard.3. art style: the art style and animations of each character truly bring them to life and make for very interesting personalities.4. gameplay: the gameplay in my opinion is really really fun because you can play however you want. I'm not the type to go all out and be in the front lines so a support character like Mercy is the one for me. I can do my part by standing in the sidelines and provide support for those who need it. The good thing is since there are offense/defence/tank/support everyone will be able to find a play style that suits them.5. one price: so far blizzard has said that for the $60, all the dlc and heroes will be includes which is refreshing to hear since companies want to charge up to $50 for new maps/features which is ridiculous (looking at you cod). overall i do think this game should be played with people you know because you have to have a well balanced team with different abilities. can't wait for Monday :) let the watch begin!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CDysonSphere,positive,10,Overwatch is worth $60. There, I said it. You can cry about your fantasy where it's F2P and has a 40 hour story mode and Blizzard personally delivers the game to your doorstop on a silver platter, but I'm too busy telling a dragon to consume my enemies.Cavalry's here love. Now shut up and enjoy your game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Construc_,positive,10,Its easy to learn, but hard to master.  No games studio ever aspires to be more than that.  the characters are diverse and interesting, the swaping of characters mid-match is a nice twist and really shakes things up, and the gameplay is snappy and fun.  while the maps and game modes are sparse, they are interesting and well designed to the point that more maps would only add clutter.  iIts easy to learn, but hard to master.

Darkwasp,positive,10,If any multiplayer game deserves 10/10, it's definitely Overwatch. I've been playing this game since the very beginning of closed beta in October, and 10 minutes were enough for me to understand: this will be a huge hit. Playing this game in beta and writing feedback on it were a whole adventure for me and a lot of other people, but now it's history and a subject for another discussion.If any multiplayer game deserves 10/10, it's definitely Overwatch.

Playing this game in beta and writing feedback on it were a whole adventure for me and a lot of other people, but now it's history and a subject for another discussion. Let's talk about current state of the game, when it's already released!But first, let's discuss the most controversial topic of all - game price. Why it's bloody $40 bucks (that is if you are happy PC gamer; it's whooping $60 on consoles)? Simple, because you're getting everything from the start. No locked abilities, heroes, maps, modes. Just think, what's best for you: pay up $$$ now or bleed money throughout the whole time you'll be playing? $3-$5 bucks per character, $10 for some monthly exp boost is already enough to end up with the same $40-$60 bucks paid just in three-four months. And it's not all, obviously, you need to pay more to keep up with the game. More characters on the way, more months coming... And it'll never end, just admit it. But here, in Overwatch, you have everything from the moment you launch the game for the fist time, and you will get future content updates, because you already paid for it. You have to understand that Overwatch, like many other games today, is work in progress, it'll never stop to evolve. Maps, modes, heroes - you will just have access to all of it once it'll be released. And it's awesome; for me it's easier to pay fixed price ahead and never worry about money for future updates.Alright, let's talk about the game already. It's class-based shooter, which means, to simplify things, a hybrid between Quake and some modern MOBA. You have an awesome, skill-based and fast shooting merged with variety of abilities and mechanics, different from one hero to another. While first part, shooting, is basically the same as in other arcade shooting games, second part, different classes with different abilities, deserves deeper explanation.Imagine, that you are playing Zarya, a tank by in-game definition, designed to push enemies back, withstand some considerable damage and shield allies for a short time. Her weapon has two modes: particle beam, which does damage if you pointing it on enemy, and projectiles, which explode and do some damage in an area. You can charge weapon by absorbing damage with barriers, which are in a short cooldown, and increase damage output by 100%, which puts her damage in line with offensive heroes, which do same damage by default. Pointing beam accurately on an enemy and hitting them with projectiles, plus absorbing damage with barriers requires some skill, at least it's not that easy to do, but once you master it, you can really outdamage everyone in your team, being both a tank and mvp-damage dealer. That was the shooting part.Now for class-based thing: you are a tank, which means you are tough; half of your health pool is rechargeable shield, which restores really fast while out of combat, and most importantly, you have barriers, one for you and one for your teammate, they help you to stay alive and charge you weapon in the same time. But the most important thing about playing Zarya is utilizing her ultimate ability. Ultimates are different for each hero, they are charging over time and in combat, and once used properly, can literally change the flow of entire round. Zarya's ultimate is one if the most useful for teamplay and combines really well with a lot of others. What it does is simple: it grabs every enemy in an area and holds them together for 4 seconds - more than enough time to kill everyone who got caught. And thing is, using this ability properly is crucial to break entrenched enemy position, and Zarya player and his/her teammates will be very well rewarded if they coordinate use of this ability very accurately.I've wrote all this to show you that game is not that simple as it looks if you glance at it for one or two minutes. Every hero and every map requires studying and learning," you can't get to the bottom of this game in two minutes of playing. It's essentially ""Easy to learn"," hard to master"" - famous motto of all Blizzard games. I've played Overwatch for more than half a year now", and I still finding some little things to help me improve my game even more.Also, it's the most fun game to play with friends I've ever seen. Admittedly, Overwatch is really un-fun to play alone; I suspect that's why so many reviews are negative. During open beta I've managed to get full six-people premade, and omg it was awesome. The best two hours of gaming I ever had in my life! Hoping to repeat it some time.P.S. And didn't even mentioned many other pros of this game, such as incredible overall quality and breathtaking art, but those 5000 character coming to and end.P.S.S. Sorry for more than possible grammar errors, English is not my native language!
PbFarmer,positive,9,After an extremely smooth launch, playing the open beta extensively and now the launch let me just say the game is incredible.  If you want a single/solo experience, it may not be for you seeing as there's no campaign, but the reality is the mechanics are fantastic, the teamplay dynamics are stupendous, and the characters are so varied and unique that there's a reason to pick up and playAfter an extremely smooth launch, playing the open beta extensively and now the launch let me just say the game is incredible.  If you want a single/solo experience, it may not be for you seeing as there's no campaign, but the reality is the mechanics are fantastic, the teamplay dynamics are stupendous, and the characters are so varied and unique that there's a reason to pick up and play everyone at some point.  There's a play style for everyone. The game emphasizes team work and going for the objective as opposed to straight up eliminations and the game is all the better for it.  You have to work strategically and try to fill gaps where your teammates roster has them, or swap to characters who can counter your opponents (see Genji as a counter vs. Bastion).  Matches last a nice amount of time ranging from 5-15 minutes which is perfect, and having loot/micro transactions locked purely to cosmetics is a welcome point.  There's no reason to do a micro transaction unless you really want to try unlocking stuff faster but otherwise you'll be all set. Hard not to recommend this game as it scratches every itch I have for a multiplayer shooter. TL;DR, if you love Team Fortress 2, you've found the next iteration for the new generation in Overwatch.  Buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A story mode would be fine, but Blizzard never planned for one in the first place, unlike Battlefront, and we do get story in the form of Disney-level quality animated shorts, and comics that they periodically release. Everything about the game, from the emphasis on team play, to the marketing campaign is lovingly crafted for us. People complain about the price tag, but this is one of the few times I personally can say the devs deserve it. I went and bought the Origins edition simply because I felt the developers did everything they could for the PLAYERS, and not for themselves, and thus did deserve more than virtually every other triple-A company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BeryFPS,positive,9,The game itself is awesome. very dynamic, fast and competitive. the bad thing is the game doesn't have advanced training systems," like ""deathmatch"" mode (servers)", custom maps to train yourself in aim/flicks etc. would be better also if blizzard allowed to hide the viewmodels, like we had in TF2 and change the HUD. those are some minor problems, but still, this game is totally sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly they will same some rubbish like this game is terrible because of Micro transactions... its just cosmetic items people relax. Anything that can be bought over micro transactions can be obtained in game. So the good about Overwatch, it's a nice escape from the usual FPS games you normally play (call of duty, battlefield etc). Overwatch is a nice change and is a truly enjoyable experience also if you bored of the same kind of gameplay just switch to a different character because each character plays differently and is just as fun as the next (use Roadhog... best ever). Overall Overwatch is a good fun time and is a must for all those that enjoy FPS and is wanting to try something new and different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With original heroes, own traits and unique special abilities, the game is like nothing before to the gaming industry. This game is an amazing addition to my Blizzard library! The game succeeds in almost every category. The graphics and design are eye-candy and the combat is extremely balanced, fluent and fun to play. Every time you level up you get loot boxes, which you use to unlock character skins, sprays, victory poses, voice lines and more, really making your hero feel unique. There are just over a thousand items to unlock in total! The game has 3 gamemodes as of now which includes Training, basic online 6v6 and weekly fun-game which even though limited is very fun and can result in hundreds of hours of gameplay if you don't get bored easily. The gameplay makes you feel like no matter who you are, you're contributing to the objective! Overwatch is well-rounded for anyone, if you're a casual to a competitive player i'd highly recommend this game, it's worth every penny!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second, the creative and technical standards of Blizzard unapologetically catapult this game into the present with such confidence and force that you wonder what the hell other developers even do with their time and resources. Beyond the superficial experience of audio-visual mastery lies a surprisingly deep mechanical foundation that demands the player's intelligence and resilience in learning its nuance and complexity.  It's one of those games where you're constantly assessing yourself and those around you to learn, critique, and improve.  This game deserves your consideration if not your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granted there isn't a boat load of content for it RIGHT NOW. Having said that many people don't look past their initial impressions and dive deep into really looking game they decide to pay $60 dollars for. I have read reviews of people who when into Overwatch having not played the beta, having not seen game play, having not done any sort of research whatsoever and rated it obscenely poorly because they felt gypped when it was clearly their own fault for a poor allocation of their funds. $60 dollars is a lot. Is this game worth that much? I can't say that everyone would feel that way at least now but that doesn't affect that I feel the gameplay, the visuals, the score and the fun isn't worth the time and money I have put into it. There is more to come and many consumers haven't bothered to check that there isn't going to be 'only' 21 characters. They will be releasing more as the game's life cycle grows completely free. I can't imagine that the map count would be any different especially since that seems to be the way map content in games is shifting. I didn't see anyone complaining about 343 giving out all of their maps in Halo 5 for free. Another gripe I have been seeing is the lack of anything unlock-able. I get that. But if that is all that drives you play Call of Duty, play Battlefield. Don't come into a game with preconceived notions that have no basis because you decided not to check it out before you blew your money and called it a crap game. It just makes you look stupid. All in all, this game is great. $60 dollars is a lot for a game period. For this game maybe a little more than that but wait it out. Do your research. Feel it out. Play it at a friends house first and if you don't like it, don't get it. If you do then sweet! You have a ton of people to play with that I know will be enjoying it just as much as you. This game is great. Lacking in a ton of content at the moment but when has Blizzard not been known to put out more? It'll come soon™. Definitely worthy of a high score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On top of all this, you have Blizzard backing this game and they have a history of supporting their properties way better than any other developer/game company out there. So if you're concerned with the lack of bells and whistles to start, just know it'll all be free down the road.

All maps feel unique, the huge amount of characters to choose from caters to people with different play styles. e.g If you like slow hard hitting tank then you'll love rienhart, if you love being the nimble damage dealer who is a pain in the ass you will love tracer, if you like camping bastion is a great character for that. The best part is every character is weak against other certain characters. For instance, bastion is a death machine but if tracer gets behind him with her ultimate ability then bastion is screwed. You would think after a few matches the game would get boring, but every match is different. I am going to give this a 9 because although it isn't what I would call essential to own, the game delivers what it promises.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I got a chance to play Starcraft: Ghost at E3 a long time ago, but then they cancelled it before it ever reached the general gaming public. Well, after 5 hours of gameplay, and ranked up to 14, I can say that it is very entertaining.  I was a huge fan of Shadowrun on the Xbox 360.

Well, after 5 hours of gameplay, and ranked up to 14, I can say that it is very entertaining.  I was a huge fan of Shadowrun on the Xbox 360.  In many ways, it was a predecessor to Overwatch: different classes, trolls that absorbed massive amounts of damage, nimble Elven samurai that could teleport through walls, dwarves with shotguns, and magic spells that would allow you to create thorned bushes.  But Shadowrun was abandoned when FASA shut down. Overwatch does most of those things and a bit more.  It has highly detailed graphics that have personality.  The presentation of the character portraits have style.  Instead of the generic soldier with different upgradeable guns, you have to learn the gameplay mechanics of each character as if it were a fighting game.  You really need to work together if you want to win.  It does need a bit more variation in terms of game types, but I'm sure Blizzard will add those as time goes on.  The core gameplay is really fun and makes me miss Shadowrun a little bit less, which is a great thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidicus,positive,10,With Overwatch, Blizzard does exactly what they do best. They take an existing concept and refine it to a level of polish that most developers will never be able to match. Some will say that there's nothing new or innovative to be found here, and that the game essentially just takes the Team Fortress 2 formula mixes in a little MOBA flavor. While technically these people are correct,With Overwatch, Blizzard does exactly what they do best. They take an existing concept and refine it to a level of polish that most developers will never be able to match. Some will say that there's nothing new or innovative to be found here, and that the game essentially just takes the Team Fortress 2 formula mixes in a little MOBA flavor. While technically these people are correct, Overwatch is a game that proves that the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts. Pros:- The 21 heroes are all unique, interesting and fun to play. Even tanks and support classes, which are typically unpopular given that most FPS players just want to selfishly hunt for kills, are a lot of fun with interesting abilities. I especially appreciate that, regardless of your preferred play style or level of experience, there is a character that you can do well with. You don't have to be an exceptional FPS player to enjoy this game and contribute to your team. This is a good thing. - The visual and audio design are incredible! I'm not just talking about the art style, which I think is fantastic, but I understand is subjective. What I'm referring to is the visual language and audio cues that the game has to tell you immediately what the heroes do, where the objectives are and what you should be doing. It only take a couple of matches to know that a specific enemy ultimate has been activated based purely on sound alone. The UI is informative, clean and gives you all of the information you need without being a distraction. Finally, the combat, heroes and maps are all colorful and bright without being garish or confusing. You may see a lot of bright effects in the middle of combat, but you know exactly what abilities those effects correspond to. - The maps and modes are engaging and fun to play. While the modes are simplistic in terms of objectives, I think Blizzard was smart to keep it that way at launch. It still amazes me that despite the simplicity of the modes, how many players still ignore them and try to hunt for kills like a traditional FPS. Hopefully more complex and interesting modes will come along after the player base matures a bit and the begins to understand that objectives are more important than individual performance.  Where the maps really shine are the hidden paths that each contains to allow certain heroes with movement abilities to back cap objectives or avoid meat-grinder choke points. These paths are not immediately obvious, but once you learn them, it's incredibly rewarding. - The hero interactions and how they compliment or counter each other, coupled with the ability to swap heroes on the fly," really make this game shine! If you're the kind of player who wants to come in and ""main"" a single hero", you'll probably be in for a bad time. But if you treat it like a MOBA and can master a handful of characters across each of the roles, then Overwatch will be a very enjoyable experience for you. - Depth without complexity. People often confuse these as being the same thing, but they aren't. Overwatch is very simple to pick up and play, even with heroes you may have never tried before. But you'll constantly find new ways to use them based on your team, the enemy team and the map you're on. - In game purchases are limited to cosmetic items only, and are completely optional. Don't care about them? Don't buy the loot boxes. You can earn them simply by playing the game. It's about as non-offensive as micro-transactions can be. If you don't care to purchase loot boxes, then don't. Buy the game once, and never pay another dime. - 60 FPS at 1080 - even on consoles. Cons:- No single player. I personally don't think this is a huge deal, or even necessary. There are fantastic games that *only* have single player, and Overwatch is a fantastic game that *only* has multiplayer. The only reason I list is as a con is because the heroes are so great that I would love a campaign. - Symmetra should really be a Defensive hero and not a Support. She doesn't heal, and her shields are not enough to really carry a team as a solo support. Her kit is really better aligned with the Defensive role, but again, this is a very minor and personal complaint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blizzard did a great job in making this game accessible to both the casual and hardcore gamer, and even if you're a complete novice you feel like you contribute and can pull off some amazing feats at times. I'm having a lot of fun playing with my friends, even when we're losing horribly. That said there are some cons. First of all this is a team oriented game that relies heavily on teamwork, so it can get a bit boring and frustrating if you aren't playing with a group of friends. Random teams just have random results so you're better off with friends. Second is the lack of a solo campaign. With Blizzard's incredible world building, with backgrounds for each character and INCREDIBLE animated shorts it feels like there is more to this game then there actually is... and I could understand that some people might have initially thought there was more to it.All this lore is actually developed for the IP in the whole that they may or may not get into with games or DLC further down the road. Third is a.. semi-con. Collectables and loot boxes or rather how they work.Blizzard has a way of tapping into the completionist in many of us. They do it in pretty much all their games, a reason why some refer to blizzard games as digital crack. Every time you level up you get a lootbox... which has a chance of giving you a few items, which can be skins, intro animations, character emotes, sprays, player icons and voice lines. These lootboxes can also be bought in-game via blizzard's store. While opening these boxes give you that exciting uncertainty of what you'll get.. it's COMPLETELY RANDOM. This means that, potentially, you could open a great deal of boxes and only get sprays, icons and voice lines and perhaps some currency while you really just wanted that one legendary skin for that once character you love to play. Also, while legendary skins cost 1000 ingame currency to unlock, if a lootbox happens to contain a skin you already have, it will only award you 200 currency. I could go on and on about this but lets just say that the RNG is strong in thisone. For some this turns out gloriously and for others it's a random generated nightmare. those are my 2cts on the game. Overall I give it a 8... a solo campaign would probably make this game a 9 or even a 10. I can't wait to see what Blizzard does next with this new franchise, there's a lot of potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zep188,positive,10,Overwatch, a game that, for some, feels like a complete rip off of TF2," has others enjoying the game for what it is and how it takes old ideas and refreshes them in Blizzards new arena shooter.

Some people have problems with the tick rate (20)  some have problems with blizzards ""favor the shooter"" mechanics", some have problems with ultimate abilities and the new cosmetic crates that blizzard wants you to pay for (although you get them passively through just playing the game and each crate costs under a dollar if you're impatient) but nobody can deny that the game is fun without sounding a little spiteful I'm here to tell you like it is, and this comes from a TF2 player with roughly 2000 hours of TF2 played, from the beginning (0 itemization on TF2 characters, no hats, no metal, no keys, no crates, etc.) to roughly 2 years ago, when the game became a drag for me. When I look at Overwatch I see a lot of characters that are deeply rooted in TF2 characters simply because of how the character works and what role they play. However, these characters are generally acceptable because they have abilities that distance themselves from other playable classes in other games. I will not be drawing direct comparisons because if you look at the characters you can draw these lines for yourself. What I am willing to say is that imitation is the best form of flattery. What I will also say is that what happened at Blizzards round table is obvious. Blizzard took a look at old games, took what they enjoyed best and what worked best to them, and decided to implement those things in their WIP; and there's nothing wrong with that. What you will mainly see in these reviews are people that are mad about characters that are obviously easier to play for new players (bastion," reinhardt etc.) and call out the nerf hammer or just say ""it's a rip off and it costs money oh and I'm bored already"" and just dismiss the game", which 350 have done, and they have every right to, but in my eyes it is a great injustice. The first time I played Overwatch, which was in the free beta not too long ago, I played solo most of the time, as i still do. I swapped my characters when I felt I should based on the enemy team and found who I was proficient at and who I wasn't, which I feel should be every new players intention. I did draw conclusions as to who acted similarly to TF2 characters and was amazed at the new abilities and new ideas that blizzard brought to the table. Yes, you have Roadhogs hook which is like Pudge from Dota, or Blitzcrank from league, but this is new ground in an arena shooter, and it is equally as satisfying. What I didn't do was become bummed out at similarities that I found; I actually enjoyed these similarities because that's what I enjoyed from previous titles as well, even if they were from different devs. What I noticed next was the fluid motion of characters and how smooth everything played out. Yes, I was flash banged by a Mccree many times, which causes a break in the action, and Mei did freeze me quite a few times, but it didn't make me rage, it made me want to think. Instead of figuring out which hat i was going to wear in TF2 I was actually thinking about how i can get around certain characters and what character I should play in order to beat the opposition and win. NOT get the most kills. One of the last things I noticed was the play of the game (POTG) which, sometimes, I admit can be a let down," but ultimate abilities are very satisfying to successfully use. You will find many players getting upset at ""broken"" ultimates but as time passes players adapt", this is also where individual player skill comes in, yes, even with Soldier76's aimbot. In short, even the most seemingly broken ultimate requires timing and a bit of finesse in order to catch more seasoned players out. All in all I'm having fun with Overwatch and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. I endorse both solo play and playing with friends. I enjoy the graphics and the mechanics. I enjoy the learning curve and most if not all of the maps currently available. Blizzard may not have made the most original arena shooter ever but it doesn't deserve the rap it gets from the peanut gallery. TL;DR, don't listen to the angry TF2 fanboys, trolls, and naysayers who caused this game such grief simply because they outright dismiss the game for having a few issues, and certainly don't let it put you off of getting the game. This game holds its own. In reality this game is a 9.2 in my book, but i'm giving it a 10 to counteract some of these unbelievable reviews and dismissals. Ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CavernClub,positive,10,I haven't felt this much joy and desire to play a video game in a long time. Overwatch is a breath of fresh air. My desire to play shooters had been slowing down for more games like smash bros and rocket league that had a little more new and unique ideas to them, so seeing another shooter being released just made me think I'll run the routine of buying a shooter, playing it the firstI haven't felt this much joy and desire to play a video game in a long time. Overwatch is a breath of fresh air. My desire to play shooters had been slowing down for more games like smash bros and rocket league that had a little more new and unique ideas to them, so seeing another shooter being released just made me think I'll run the routine of buying a shooter, playing it the first week or two, trying to find friends who have it so I'll have people to play with I know, and then getting bored/forgetting about it until the dust settles so high on it that giving it away isn't even Worth it. But I gave Overwatch a shot and I can't believe I hadn't been excited about this before. Upon loading up the game and starting with the tutorial, I struggled a bit with the controls. My shooter experience started with mainly Halo, Call of Duty and games the like, so not having sprint(or with the tutorial character Soldier 76 being tied to a button press) made things a little foreign. Realizing that every character was a completely different play style and had his or different kinks and actions was daunting at first, but it remind me of picking a fighter in Smash Bros., and Like in smash bros where basic such as jump, move and the buttons you press to attack so will every character control in a constant way. The defining and differentiating factor being the unique and creative abilities I've only dreamed about in shooter games.Having so many options to choose from and learning how all work with different team makeups makes this game so refreshing. Every game brings you a new ever changing puzzle that you and you team must solve. I have never been able to play the every level the same way and I love that. I don't want an experience in a game where I know the sniper sits up here and the turret always goes here. In games like Call of Duty where people end up using the same gun because it way overpowered, the balancing so perfect in Overwatch you will almost never blame it. Every character can be countered and if the situation calls for it you area me to change characters at anytime. If a team is dominating it's because they have a well organized group and are strategizing with each other. It is up to your team to figure it out how to take the opposing team and Objective. And I can't stress enough how much your team is the most important thing. So many games try to promote teamwork but it never works they way they say. I honestly feel like if any game has a team deathmatch mode you start only worrying about how you are playing, trying to get a positive k/d ratio and you will never be able to promote teamwork. Overwatch does not let you focus on yourself. It's not about you, it's about you working with others. I found myself constantly changing characters and trying to find the best for my team and for the situation and we started dominating and the other team didn't adapt, we would win in what felt like a heartbeat. I could go on for awhile about how I don't care if you are the best Hanzo player out there, having 2-4 of them on a team while we are attacking will rarely ever work. And I say rarely for a reason; because there is no definite way to play this game. There's no easy always win team combination. Sometimes a strategy might call for 4 Hanzos' and I love that Overwatch allows for a discovery that most shooter games have never gotten close too. You can feel the love and passion of the developers in every single detail of this game. There is nothing out of place. Every match I had, menu I scrolled through made me just feel like a kid again. I never wanted it to end. I have obsessed over this game. From something I had almost no interest in, to now wanting to spend all my free time with my wife and friends playing this game. I have a game I truly love and has refilled my passion for a genre that I believe has been getting stale. Thank you Blizzard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you don't want to slog threw unlocking through level up then you can buy loot boxes PSN.  The unlocks do nothing and are only for cosmetic purposes not to strengthen. Story Mode: Yes the game has no story mode mostly because the characters stories and what Overwatch is explained in the cinematic movies on Youtube. Polygon recently made a timeline for the game on its site so you can probably find it on Google by typing Overwatch timeline. Blizzard has confirmed all update content free as Blizzard stated in an interview with Ubergizmo. I only have one con about Overwatch and that's your team fighting over who has to be the team Medic. If you don't have a team member who loves being the Medic then you’re going to have problems. I like Overwatch and I like the fact of knowing that any content that comes out in the future is free and I don't have to pay for it so I know that I’ll be playing for a very long time as the content comes out.

I have found a lot of variability in this game", through the different maps and different characters. Your gameplay is constantly changing, as you have to pick different characters in order to hold off an enemy team's push if your original team composition wasn't working out. This game, although it doesn't feel like it, requires at least a little bit of thinking," such as ""When is a good time to use this ultimate?"" Or"," ""What can I do or who can I pick to really support my team more?""Now", to story-line. It is understandable that, as this is a Blizzard game, it is almost expected for them to have a campaign of some sort, and any type of backstory, and it really does. Each character has its own unique backstory into the whole story of Overwatch, before the setting of the game. The backstories make for great reads. Also, Blizzard is working on very detailed animated shorts that explain each characters' backstories were, in a more engaging way. This is easily one of them most engaging FPS' I have ever played on PC, in it's own unique way. I'm not saying this is any Battlefield game, or more similarly, Quake arcade-like shooter, but it's still so engaging to it's audience. The 98 rating, as of right now as I write this, is extremely justified. I have played north of maybe 15-16 hours of this game somewhat, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. The only reason why I haven't given this game a 10/10 is because you will not enjoy it as much if you aren't playing with at least one other friend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meanrock,positive,9,Amazing game that doesn't take it self too seriously. You can sit down and play this game for 10 minutes or 3 hours- an important feature as I grow older and have less chances to marathon a game. The art is polished to Blizzards' high standards. The game modes and maps are very intuitive(huge +) but have less variety. This game has one big trick up its sleeve- this isn't a team shooter.Amazing game that doesn't take it self too seriously.

It has a roster of 21 well balanced characters, huge when compared to other FPS games but average for a MOBA.  Any team fight depends on character run back and death timers, character ultimate abilities have huge potential for synergy - and a skill gap if you don't understand that. The micro transaction are only for character collectible items and aesthetics, no impact on game play. Blizzard did everything right with this game, its longevity will only depend on additional maps and game modes being added in the months/years to follow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

La non esistenza di un servizio per la segnalazione di pessimi giocatori od un sistema per consigliare ad altri quel determinato soggetto, ogni partita è solo pura anarchia.

PlaysGames,positive,6,Over all Overwatch is a very pretty and mechanically decent multiplayer shooter. The biggest reason it gets such a  low score for me is the poor hit registration.

The kill cam doesn't show me moving at all," even at very low (>20ms) ping. It feels like Overwatch uses a ""favor the shooter"" approach to discrepancies in hit registration. Making twitch reactions or last second clutch plays impossible. I've also had issues with people leaving my games", or being put into games as they end. Someone leaving basically gauntness victory for the other team, and joining a game where a team was one player down for a few minutes is no fun either. There do't seem to be any penalties for leaving, and as far as I can tell its actually encouraged in some places. If a friend invites you to play while you are in a game, a message comes up on your screen inviting you. If you accept you abandon the current game and join a lobby with your friend, screwing over your teammates from that match as they are now down a player. Other than that, the game modes and maps aren't super special but it is still a pretty fun game to hop into every now and then and blow off some steam. I would not recommend taking the game to seriously or trying to play competitively as there are too many things out of your control that effect the outcome of the game. (Poor hit detection, a couple unbalanced heroes, people joining and leaving games, lack of information about team, etc.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I see a lot of people complain about the lack of competitive modes or complaining that the game should be F2P. competitive is coming and the idea that is should be F2P is just absurd, yeah there aren't very many maps yet," but Blizzard has stated that all future content will be free. I also have no idea why some people are complaining about ""micro-transactions"" the only thing that would qualify in this game is buying loot crates", which would be dumb of you anyway since you will literally get 99 free crates just by playing the game and by then you'd have enough in-game currency to get anything else that you really want. I should also mention that the only thing you get from loot crates is cosmetic items. That's it," it's not like TF2 where you PAY to open a crate in hopes of getting an arguably better weapon. I've also seen people complain about a ""minimal"" player base", that's just pure BS. The game has about 7 million players right now ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I am surprised to find that some people think that the devs don't deserve 40€ (or according to some, no money at all) for this game simply because it's PvP and because of the low number of game modes. I don't know why it should be a set standard that every PvP game needs to be F2P or can only cost a certain amount of money. In my opinion, the characters are well balanced and well designed, and the characters that need a slight nerf or buff are already in the process of being subject to that change. I love the diversity of their functions in the context of teamplay. I love the gameplay and the sound design. And after 40 hrs of playing this game, I have as much fun playing it now as I did when it was released only a few weeks ago. Already now, I feel like I have gotten my money's worth and Blizzard did an extremely good job of delivering a new and addictive FPS experience for me.

The second problem is some balancing issues, where certain classes just outshine. But other than that, the game provides a lot of fun, especially if you are tired of the downward slope that TF2 has been on. Updated: A lot of the negative reviews are heavily outdated and most of the complaints here are no longer valid, including such claims as there only being two gamemodes (there's a lot more than that in the arcade section alone), hackers (I have not once played a game with a hacker), and other issues that are no longer prevalent. It's a shame to see a metascore be so unfairly affected by outdated issues and people who have no idea what they are truly talking about.

But it's basically a hero based arena shooter where each hero has something that makes it unique from the rest, This causes some heroes to be stronger against others or vice versa. Your success in Overwatch is directly related to your teams lineup and how well you work together. Playing solo may result in some very bad games if your team isn't wanting to work together. Playing with groups of friends will be much more enjoyable. Currently Overwatch only has Quick Matches and personal ranks but they plan to add a full ranked mode for people who want to take it seriously.The design behind Overwatch is done so perfectly, Everything from sound to characters it all just works so well together. Audio queues will let you know if someone is using a Ultimate or even the foots steps of a specific hero. Not much bad can be said when it comes to this aspect of Overwatch.One of the only things you can complain about with Overwatch is Matchmaking and team builds. Nothing is more discouraging then getting destroyed by a full grouped team over and over or getting paired up against people much higher level players. This will hopefully be fixed with the addition of competitive mode. Also having team stack one hero can make a game unplayable...some of the builds you can make up are nothing but torture.All in all if you enjoy multiplayer games like Team Fortress 2 and you are able to keep your cool give Overwatch a try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chars are all so fun", charismatic and unique that you want to try out all of them...and keep on switching during your gaming sessions. Only downside (so I would quote 9) are the character models. Don't get me wrong... The graphics are beautifull but I kinda feel like they're a little bit to manga-ish for me (I know manga fans will think otherwise and say they aren't manga at all). The fact that this is a game WITHOUT A SEASON PASS let's me add 1 point to my quotation! We want extra content yes, but don't publish a half-done game like SW:BF just to be able to ask people money for season passes right away...

Joy-Energiser,positive,9,The game certainly has lived up to its hype, I haven't felt the need to log into a game and play so much since CSGO first came out.

GabrielKD,positive,9,To get it out of the way, if you're mostly looking for any semblance of PvE content, you might as well not even touch this game.

I had no interest in Overwatch for the many months that it was in Closed Beta," then the open beta came around and I gave it a whirl. I knew beforehand that it's a purely team-based pvp game with a diverse cast of ""heroes"" with a coupe of abilities. I had no idea how the game felt when played thou. I was blown away", the responsiveness is great and it feels amazing, you feel in control of everything you do and when you fail you feel you could've done better and not blame the controls or mechanics. The heroes are amazing, the character design and art style is stellar and all of it feels very polished (in true Blizzard style). At launch you get 21 unique heroes on 12 maps with 2-4 game modes. I say 2-4 because there are basically only 2 game modes with slight variations that could be considered an extension to 4 game modes. The game revolves around team play," all modes are centered around 6 vs 6 and coordinating with your team on the fly can be very rewarding. Naturally quick plays with random people can and will often end in disaster with a ""fluster cluck"" of people doing everything but what the objective is on the map. The game also revolves around being able to change heroes on the fly every time you die in order to counter whatever your enemy team throws at you. There are some iffy plays such as 6 of the same heroes (yes you can have more than one of one type of hero in a team) that require an almost full team of hard counter heroes to pummel into non-existence and that can be difficult to agree on with a random array of players. Each hero has a few abilities unique to them with an ""Ultimate"" skill that for many/most classes can turn the tables in a match if played out right. Very satisfying to pull of your skills just right and throw the ultimate just right (each ultimate is different and has its own role and synergy). Exploring the synergies between heroes makes for endless", potentially satisfying, plays that keep you going from match to match.Speaking of matches, the extremely fast pace of the game makes for a very small average match time of about 7-9 minutes which is great and lets you get past that bitter defeat (that you will likely run into..) and move to another match. Many reviews I've seen here from disgruntled users talk about how the game lacks content for the price point of 40/60 dollars (40 on pc, 60 on consoles). I was slightly inclined to agree when it dawned me that I actually consider it to have enough content for the 40 dollar price tag on pc at least. Firstly the game was advertised as a purely competitive pvp experience and no pve," even thou the cinematic ""trailers"" could lead you to believe it might have....The closed beta has been going on for ages and anyone interested in the game should have already known this", and what the game will launch with, this was common and basic info available to everyone. Secondly," when people say ""I got bored of the same modes on the same 12 maps in a few hours"" I don't understand it", does a FIFA fan get bored of the same exact mode of play ? Does a CS player get bored ? This game is hugely varied by comparison to most competitive, no progression (no leveling, no items) games out there. I and, I assume, many like me," play for the situations I'm put in with my team mates. I'm trying various classes in various situations and having a blast. One thing to note is that there is some alleged net code ""issues"" discussions floating around. Those are actually Blizzard's choice on how to approach the netcode of their game", weather it's the best choice or not remains to be seen and if needed I'm sure Blizzard will tweak it.

The game is really casual-friendly and toxicless compared to other online games I've played in years, queues are fast," matches take only around 5-10 minutes and people can't even see each other's scoreboard. The biggest problem is that this game relies heavyly on the MOBA mentality while being buy2play (which is ""let's focus on making addictive and fun online-only gameplay in certain type of map to cover how repetitive and content-lacking the game actually might feel""). So if you're not hyped for Overwatch after watching gameplays or playing the beta", you probably shouldn't buy it. Other problem are microtransactions. I have no problem spending money in games, but I hate to gamble. You can't simply buy the ingame currency and spend it on what you want," the only thing you can buy are RNG lootboxes that are filled with extra ""cosmetics"" like voicelines and sprays on purpose. You can eventually collect the coins from loot and buy what you want", but I bet it will take you at least 20$.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ShineHunter,positive,8,I'm tempted to give this a 7 for the fact that this game has more cheese than cheddar. Meaning that the one shot kills and devastating alts are real.

OK the talk is they removed it because of unfairness, I'm guessing if true someone at Blizzard has way too strong opinions. Did they remove 4K support or higher frame rates or 7.1 surround sound or headphones, nope. Graphics could look sharper and more crisp on 1440p. The effects are poor in places. Don't believe me in spawn shoot a canister and watch those great smoke effects. However I couldn't give it a 7 because of the fun gameplay minus cheesy alts taking your skilled kill streak out. I have only ran into minimal bugs since playing and no of which was when playing. The heros are done well and I'm always swapping between them. Controller support is there but needs more aim assist to balance and feels stiff. I did get a 20 kill streak using a pad so you can do well. K&M; works perfect. Performance is OK. I'm playing at 1440p with ultra settings getting 70/85fps with my GTX 980ti clocked at 1400mhz. Geforce experience will optimise the game for better frame rates. The maps are laid out like one large MOBA lane. The modes are fun but limited. The content is poor in my opinion but I believe more skins and stuff will come in time. Loot boxes are fun to open no matter how many times I get nothing of good. Bad news is there is the option to buy loot boxes from Blizzard's store, shame on you Blizzard. To get more fun out of this game, play with friends. Fun is what makes a game and fun at the end of the day is what you get hence my score of 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jounichi,positive,9,I enjoyed the open beta, pre-ordered the base version, and honestly it's some of the best $40 I've spent in a long while.

In my experience defend missions are an easier time than attack missions, but I've both won and lost some close matches so it may not even be worth mentioning. As general policy I don't like giving games (or anything) perfect scores because it discourages improvement, but the game as released has done an excellent job of what it set out to do. I'd like some more modes, and we'll get them eventually. My biggest gripe is there's no way to earn the in-game currency used to buy customization options for characters. Once you hit maximum level you're stuck buying loot crates, and (in my opinion) the occasional repeated drops of the same skin/tag/voice/etc don't award enough currency to offset the loss of something better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RappScallion,positive,9,"Overwatch brings back the fun back in shooters. Remember that? When shooters actually were fun?

Remember that? When shooters actually were fun? Before they got bogged down in military shooters ""ad naseum"""," like COD and Battlefield? Before everything had to be so damn serious and ""realistic""? Before you had to grind levels to unlock weapons and attachments just to stand a chance? Before you had to have reflexes like a mongoose to get a kill or calculate the Coriolis effect when firing? When shooters actually were ""casual"" and for all skill levels", rather than a group of elitist jerks with too much time on their hands? When it was about up close-up mayhem and carnage rather drawn out sniping duels over miles of distance? Blizzard took a long, hard look at the state of shooters and had the courage to throw out the tropes and do something new. Yes, Overwatch borrows ideas and concepts from other shooters and games but Blizzard puts their own spin on them polishes them to brilliant sparkling gems. I haven't had this fun in a shooter for ages and it takes me back to the early days of Quake, Half-Life and Unreal Tournament, it's mayhem at it's finest. It's beautiful, polished and oh so much fun. Two thumbs up! Update! After reading some of the negative reviews here I thought I'd adress some of the, in my opinion, unfair and whiny complaints. THERE IS NO SINGLE PLAYER! Blizzard made it very clear from the start that this was a multiplayer game ONLY so whining about single player makes no sense at all. That's like going to an Indian restaurant and then complaining that they don't serve Italian food. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CONTENT! What? 21 superbly crafted characters, 12 maps and four game modes is not enough? I'm sorry, I'll take a highly polished gem over a dinosaur-sized turd any time of the day. Quantity does not equal quality. Also, remember when TF2 was released? It only had 3 game modes, 6 maps and still only has 10 characters. THE GAME IS UNBALANCED! Not it's not. Granted, a character might need a minor tweak here and there but for the most part I'm astounded how balanced the characters are. However," one of the core concepts of this ""rock-paper-scissors""-game is that you must change character as needed during a match and a team must have a balanced composition. Only offense characters in your team with no tank", healer or defense? You don't want to change character from your precious Reaper/? Then expect get beaten, often and thoroughly and you deserve it. MATCHMAKING IS BROKEN No it's not.  And no, there is no Blizzard conspiracy to keep you at a 50/50 win/loss ratio. Game Director Jeff Kaplan addressed most of these complaints in the Blizzard forum and they turned out to be nothing but conspiracy theories and hot air. Remember, level does not equal skill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As for the maps, each invites characters of multiple playstyles to have at it, tackling each differently. Finally, the characters are no more alike than my shoe and Donald Trump, each unique and exciting in their own way. I have not once been bored of the game and have played hundreds of matches. Also unlike some games (*cough* BO3 *cough*) loot boxes only contain cosmetics and items that do not change stats, making microtransactions for them completely harmless. Plus more maps and characters are on the way as free DLC, so I eagerly await them, as should you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SaviourI,positive,9,I'll start by saying this is the most FUN I've had playing a game in many years. It reminds me the days I used to play Super Smash Brothers 64, or the first year I played league of legends. I'm 60+ hours in, and I'm still having an amazing time. I believe i'll still be playing this on into 2017.

It reminds me the days I used to play Super Smash Brothers 64, or the first year I played league of legends. I'm 60+ hours in, and I'm still having an amazing time. I believe i'll still be playing this on into 2017. Here's why: A lot of people writing these reviews are giving this game poor ratings simply because they want a niche competitive shooter where they don't have to rely on teammates to win," and they can ""main"" any character a pull off a victory. If you're looking for a game like that", then obviously overwatch is not for you. You do need to work with your team to achieve victory, and you'll have to play lots of different characters along the way. This may sound like a bad thing, and it would be if all the characters were not so interesting and fun to play. The beauty of Overwatch is that it IS still fun even when you are not winning. This may be due to the fact that the game is very new and that I have not played enough matches so that I require myself to win in order to feel the gratification needed to feel like I'm having fun. (as so many people do) Overwatch was made with the casual gamer in mind, so you can be successful at this game even if you've never played a shooter before. Pick up a support like Mercy, or a defense character like Mei. Both require very little skill and can have a huge impact on a game. For offense, try Reaper, or Soldier 76. Again, both require little skill. This doesn't mean that Overwatch is simply about being easy. If you're looking for a more challenging experience, you could always try characters like genji and hanzo, both of whom require a great amount time to understand and appreciate, and will never truly be mastered. It is especially rewarding to play these characters since you can feel more accomplished in making a big play with them because you know it requires more skill. Matches are generally very short if they are one-sided, so if you're being crushed by the enemy team you know it will be a quick game, but if it's a close game they are usually very intense and can last a long time. This ensures you are rarely 'stuck' in a bad game for very long, and spend more time in the 'good' games. Another thing I love about this game is how little down time there is between matches. I've rarely had to spend more than a minute between matches, and on average I spend about 5-10 seconds between one game ending and the next game loading up for me to pick my hero. This is huge for those who play moba's, (I played both league and heroes of the storm) where down time between games could average about 10 minutes, which got agonizing for me. It's a really nice change of pace. What about the cost? Is 40 dollars too much for a game like this? I would say no, but I could understand why some would say yes. Many want to keep pushing games being free to play, but it's ridiculous for us to expect no investment on our part when these big companies put in millions of dollars of investment on theirs. Overwatch will continuously be updated for free. Free new characters, maps, and modes. All you have to is drop that initial 40 dollars on it, and you have game that will entertain you for the next year. (at least) What about microtransactions? How do they affect the game? They don't at all. Microtransactions are only for buying cosmetic items. You have no reason to spend any more money on this game unless you simply gotta have something cosmetic that makes your favorite character even cooler. There are some negatives to this game: There is pretty much no story in game, since there is no single player campaign or co-op mode exploring characters background. For some people this may be a deal breaker, but who's to say that such will not exist in future patches. There are only 2 game modes right now. Another thing that could be fixed in the future. Summary: Overwatch can be enjoyed by anyone. Casual gamers will love how easy it is to get into and have fun. Hardcore gamers will love the challenge certain characters bring, and the reward of playing them well. (I respect anyone who can play hanzo and genji well) It's a game that's only gonna get better with time, as new characters, maps, and modes are promised for free. As far as arena based shooters are concerned, Overwatch can't be beat. Pro's:+ Lots of different characters to play of all different skill levels+ Gorgeous graphics, sound, and atmosphere+ Very little downtime between matches+ Once you've both the game you don't need to spend any more money+ Free updates planned for the future ensures game will be fun for a long time at no cost Cons:- No story in game, only multiplayer (no single player campaign, co-op mode, or anything of that nature)- Only 2 game modes (Payload, point capture) Hope this helped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything from the art, to the level design to the balance is very good and it only seems to be improving and will likely continue to improve for a long time. It's also just a lot of plain ol' fun to play. Also, just get it for PC. Mouse and keyboard work much better, it only costs $40.00 on PC ($20 less than on console) and just like TF2, Awesomenauts and most other online multiplayer games that get a PC and console release, the PC version will likely be relevant for much longer. It scales pretty well on pretty much any mid-range laptop bought within the last 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definitely gonna blow the dying TF2 out of the picture, honestly that game is becoming garbage nowadays.Anyways, I played the beta and it was a blast. The 21 heroes are all unique and varied, they all have great abilities, and the lack of equippable weapons will make the game feel fair and balanced through the years.Some of them feel a bit OP, but I'm sure Blizz will balance the characters so everyone's on a level playing field.There are currently 4 gamemodes, control points, payload, hybrid, and king of the hill. They're all fun and getting objectives done with teammates is fun.The overall game design is also fantastic, the visuals are sort of cartoonish, but with a bit of realism mixed in, and it looks very good. The game is also well optimized on PC, which is honestly the best platform to play on, as I feel reaction time and being quick to counter an enemy is best done with a mouse and a controller joystick is rather clunky and less accurate for a shooter like this,.The customizability options are really good, too, many sprays(not stickers), skins, voice clips, emotes, and victory poses are incredible.However, the game is not perfect, and I have a couple complaints.The PotG is not good at all, and focuses mostly on killstreaks, and forgoes plays by, for example, support pushing a team and overall being very helpful. They're there, but few and far between.Also, the loot boxes are poorly done I find, Blizz is notorious for putting terrible RNG in their games, which is a total minus for me, loot is random, poorly, I might add. You'd be hard pressed to get little more than a boring spray most of the time. At least the loot boxes are only for customizability, and not for game changing additions like more powerful weapons or something. I just wish the customizability wasn't so hard to come by.those nitpicks only knock the score to a 9/10, but this is still a great game, well worth the $40.Also, I've seen some very poorly made reviews here. You don't give the game a 0 or 1 because you expected a single player when the game was MARKETED as a Multiplayer only shooter, not to mention most of Blizzard's games are online-only. Also, complaining about the game being only f2p, are you freaking nuts? Competitive is coming next month and Blizzard wanted it to be good enough for the players, and didn't want to delay the game, also more content will no doubt be added later on, so suck it up and stop complaining, your opinion deserves to be called out if it's made questionably. Also, I understand not liking the game, but giving the game 0s and 1s? Give me a break. Then again, Metacritic is full of people who don't have any idea what they're talking about and shouldn't make reviews at all, so yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No match you play is ever the same.Maps are designed for a specific game-mode which makes them mostly balanced if you have a good team.The competitive mode is coming around the end of June, which gives players lots of time to learn the game.

I honestly do not like Team Fortress 2, I've never liked it and I hate playing it. But somehow, Blizzard has managed to make Team Fortress minus every single one of its mistakes. It's heroes are joyously fun, with loads of personality, the level design on almost every single level is outrageously well-balanced, and every single little detail has been thought through so well. People here are complaining that the lack of content means the price isn't justified, and in almost any other case, I'd agree. But not here. This game so well deserves it's $40 price tag, and not to mention that every new map, game mode, and hero will be free on release. The only micro-transactions are for random loot to customize your character, all cosmetic items, which I am 100% okay with. Buy this game.

At the end of each game you are always begging for more. + If you ever played an arcade shooter like Quake, Dirty Bomb, Enemy Territory, and you enjoyed them," well then this game is for you.  It fits in perfectly with those in terms of arcade fast pace fps. - Although there ""can"" be a high skill cap just like any game there is a limit.  Spells are simple.  Characters like Lucio have a heal and a speed buff.  Outside of timing when to use it", there isn't much challenge and reward into playing the character.  You don't get rewarded for swapping between the speed and heal, or anything of that sort. This follows with all the characters. Characters + There's currently 21 and given how short games are, I was abled and pleased to play them all.  Some of them feel like clones off others games, (Reinhart = Mordakaiser) and others are copies straight from their own franchise (Torbul = Valve TF but uses a Dwarf race as an engineer) + All of the characters seem to have a fun addicting style of game play that keeps the game interesting. Maps + There's roughly 13 (??) I've enjoyed most of them and seem to have the best action in smaller more enclosed areas then the larger opposite. - A lot of maps have HEAVY choke points that when on attack side can feel like a real pain trying to push through 2 bastions and a torbul turret. - Some maps seem to have dead ends (The Chinese one for example).  Also my friends and I occasionally get lost after a spawn has been moved and the walk is a good 20 seconds from the battle. Meta - The current pro scene seems to be playing lot of Reinhart + Mercy setups.  I don't mine Mercy has a main healer but it appear that if you aren't using Reinhart has your #1 tank, you aren't playing correctly.  I hope Blizzard nerfs him or finds away to introduce tanks better. Performance + It's top notched.  The game runs smooth like butter. It feels like one of the most polished games I have played.  Joining lobbies, games, navigating the menu system, is all fluent and quick.  It's a masterpiece by Blizzard. Overall Best way to describe my Overwatch experience ...... It's FUN.  If you want to enjoy playing a game, pick it up. It's missing a hardcore competitive edge to it so it'll never bypass games like Counter-Strike but that's not it was designed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the get go, this gamePresentation In one word: Gorgeous. Truly there isn't anything negative I can say about this game's presentation. From textures to particle effects, from guns to snarky quips, this game is perfect in this category. Overwatch doesn't necessarily have the highest fidelity textures, but this game's unique style makes this game an absolute pleasure to look at. From the get go, this game bombards you with fantastic looking particle effects. Every explosion and ultimate is jaw-dropping and incredibly well done. The sound is amazing as well. I'm very particular when it comes to sound, but I think this is probably the best sounding game I've ever played. The soundtrack is great, the voice actors are great, and every gun sounds unique and well done. Content I guess the thing you should know going into this game is that it is multiplayer only. There is no single player campaign, and there is no co-op mode. There are also twelve maps and every map has its own particular gamemode. To me, that is a reasonable amount of maps, but for a game that only has multiplayer, I'd like to see more. I would wager to guess we will get some later down the line, most likely via a paid map pack, but maybe they will add some new free maps as this game progresses. Again though, this is a similar amount of maps that launch with other big FPS games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Battlefront. There are twenty-one different heroes that all have their own unique play style. I love the amount of variety in them, and with the loot box system, you can customize every aspect of them; like skins, intros, and voice lines, to your liking. Each hero has fifty-four different items to can get via the loot box system and you get a loot box for every level gained. You can also purchase them through the store. If this was a $60 game, I would worry about the amount of content, but the reduced price of $40 makes it worth it in my opinion. Gameplay This is where this game shines the most. Overwatch's unique blend of teamwork and gun gameplay gives it a fantastic feeling and very rewarding shooter. This game certainly will have the longevity everyone was hoping for and it seems like it will make a perfect game for the eSports scene. Like I mentioned earlier, each hero feels and plays differently, meaning you can vary how you play this game every match or every death if you feel so inclined. I don't think any particular hero is distinctly overpowered and every hero does have a couple of counters available. Obviously with every multiplayer shooter, your enjoyment is dependent at least in part on the other players in the game, but I find this game to be very enjoyable the vast majority of the time. I find it fun to be able to tailor my play-style based on the map, or the gamemode, or what my teammates are using to best help us win. With Overwatch, I can do that with the wide array of characters available. What truly keeps me coming back is finding your role within a team, and help leading them to victory. Overall This is the best shooter I've played in years. I think this game is a definite must-buy for any FPS fan. Now If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing Overwatch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rickswan,negative,5,Overwatch is popular, and it scores highly. Is this because it's a mind-bendingly great game? I don't think so. I think it's average at best, shallow and flawed at worst.

I think the shorts are better than the actual game. They've really created a world that is exciting and interesting.3) Blizzard has some pretty devoted fanboys/girls. Many companies have blindly devoted and un-objective fans, and Blizzard is no different. It helps that this is their first new IP in ages, as well as Blizzard's first foray into the FPS market. The actual gameplay? It's alright. I was never a fan of asymmetric competitive shooters, so that doesn't help. In general I find the game to be just... decent. Not bad at all, but not great either. I played every character in the beta for a few hours, and I can tell this will be another game that I play for a few weeks and then slowly stop once the buzz wears off. It is fun to play with friends, I'll give it that. Just don't expect it to be the greatest thing ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tensa2341,positive,8,This by means is not a perfect game and the value in its state is a bit overly expensive but as you reach the core of the main game itself, the gameplay, characters, and production value that was put into it; the game shines in a new identity for itself. In full honesty, I'd say wait for a sales drop, like 30-40 dollars to make this pruchase, otherwise though it's a great game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least Overwatch keeps it purely cosmetic, if you only care about the gameplay this game costs 20 dollars and ONLY 20 dollars (for PC). It's not even like you don't get skins through just playing the game, you do, and most players tend to get a fair amount of legendary skins, the game's most high dollar item...They just don't get the ones they want. Babies, the lot of them. Oh boo hoo," RNG gave you the wrong T-Shirt. Better rate the game a 0 and claim it's all due to the ""high"" price tag and the evil of microtransactions. Try to stick to actual criticism in the future", like how the competitive watch was a complete mess and how the gain and loss of points seems way too heavy on the loss with not nearly enough gain. Or how Overwatch's vibrant cast seems almost focus grouped to appeal to everyone without being remotely controversial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oculolingus,positive,8,Here is what I think Overwatch is good at, and what it's bad at: Positive:- Incredibly fun to play as a team, whether it be perfect balance of defense, offense and support or six Winston tanks running in with primal rage for a super strike.

Everything isHere is what I think Overwatch is good at, and what it's bad at: Positive:- Incredibly fun to play as a team, whether it be perfect balance of defense, offense and support or six Winston tanks running in with primal rage for a super strike. Seriously, it's fun.- Fast paced and easy to maneuver around. Very few times have I gotten bored because the game was too slow. Everything is quick and leaves me with an adrenaline rush when I'm a lone Lucio on the payload in overtime with a Reinhardt-Mercy combo running at me.- Easy to play most characters; rewarding to play those that are not. Bastion, essentially a sentry gun that can move and repair itself, can be used by pretty much anyone who plays Overwatch. While heroes like Zarya can take time to learn and use effectively.- Runs very well on my computer. Not sure if it's just because it's powerful, or the game is very well optimized. Negative:- Matchmaking can sometimes take a while. I've sat in a Skirmish for five minutes before. While that's not a seriously long wait-time, I can sometimes get into a game in five seconds.- Some things feel unbalanced to use and fight against. Reinhardt's shield is incredibly powerful and can defend the entire team while Bastion sets up right behind him and mows every single person down. Very good for both defense and offense, but seemingly unfair to defend or fight against. Overall: Incredibly fun to play and get into, especially with friends. The price tag on the Origin version is not worth the extra skins and items you get for buying it. Stick with the base, $40.00 version and you'll be absolutely fine and dandy. In the twenty hours I've played, I haven't come across any hackers. That's not to say there isn't any, but is part of my experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every Tf2 class has a direct adaptation in overwatch and all of the game modes are the same. However Tf2 (mind you a FREE game) has far more value than overwatch. More game modes, more customization and, more maps and the list goes on and on. Overwatch is simply lacking in value in every aspects. Overwatch still can be fun, there’s a well-balanced diverse cast of heroes and a more completive approch. If I were you I would wait for a sale and just get TF2 for free to wait out that time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's a feat, because I have not had much fun with FPS games since the likes of Halo Reach and old TF2. It has it's cons but the pros outweigh them no question, as I will list now. Pros:- 21 heroes all with massively different play-styles, designs and personalities. More heroes are to be added.-Fair amount of maps, all based on areas of the world in the future like London, Egypt, Siberian Russia, and Japan-Maps are tailored to the game type making play fluid and coherent-Payload, Capture the point and defend the point are all fun, some have both mixed in, like Numbani-Metagame is ever evolving," making ""mastering"" the game an addictive and changing task-Progression is addicting", no level cap, loot boxes unlocked each level, and several achievements to unlock keeps the game very re-playable and hard to stop when on a good run-Skill ceiling is potentially quite high but also fun and intuitive for casuals-Weekly brawl keeps you coming back for more. Can be absurdly fun.-Objective based game-play means you can really feel like you are impacting on your teams success, and stops the game becoming an incoherent deathmatch. There are some cons, however: -So far only two game types- Payload and Capture point/ Defend and attack point, may limit the games long-term re-playability-No single player campaign. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it is a bit disappointing considering the seemingly interesting lore to the game, and the vibrant characters. The animated shirts on YouTube are really amazing, however.-High price for an online only shooter, but future heroes and maps will all be free, and the game is very polished. Cosmetics can be unlocked through earned loot boxes and currency, but also bough with real money.-Lack of team communication can be frustrating, so a ready made team of friends will usually destroy a team of randomers-Custom games can not be put into matchmaking. When joining a quickplay match, you have no choice over game type or map. Also, when opening loot boxes, opening many that you have can be very fun and exiting, but if you open them one by one, the contents of the box can be disappointing. Skins, victory poses and highlight intros are blatantly more satisfying than sprays and emotes. But when you do get them it's even better. Each time you level up you get a loot box but leveling up gets much slower as you go, so the amount of loot boxes you will be earning will go down. Items in the store like skins and emotes are usually 75 credits, which is very little in this game, I assure you. Some cost more at 200, for epic items. Legendary items cost 1000 and I like this, because I don't want everybody to have every legendary skin, it takes the reward out of it. So to sum up, this is a fun and flashy shooter that is fun and addictive in the short term, hard to stop playing in a night. Ranked is not in the game as of now but will be added. The metagame is always changing and mastering heroes is fun. Hero switching means countering heroes gives an element of strategy to the game. The game feels a bit empty right now but I'm in no doubt more maps and gamemodes will be added soon- and new heroes are going to shake up the metagame. A lack of campaign is sad since the lore is very interesting but I have no doubt many shorts and comics will be released- perhaps a movie! Blizzard did it with Warcraft so why not? I recommend for players who like games like TF2, or even other FPS games like CS:GO. Even if you don't like FPS games this is fun enough that you may just enjoy it. Don't be seduced by the adverts, however, they completely mis-advertise the game, know that this is purely an online shooter. The game is also superior on the PC due to the fast nature of the game. Final score of 8. Very fun and flashy, but may not be long lasting if many more maps and modes are added, and I hope it doesn't share the fate of games like Titanfall, but Blizzards loyal fanbase should prevent that happening, especially on PC.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think these guys who are talking about price live in a different world, where everything doesn't need to be paid, even if it's really well made. I have a suggestion for you: simply don't buy it and leave it be. Don't review a game because of its price, but because of everything else it can offer to you, even though these are not even reviews, but just some pain-in-the-ass complainings. Overwatch itself is pretty nice, it all depends of the player-style. Some people might find it boring after some rounds, but others (who are more in a competitive way) will really enjoy the experience. Play it with friends, and it will be a much better experience.The graphics are totally awesome and the gameplay it pretty nice, too.The only downside of the game, imo, is just the lack of a single player campaign, just because I really like to be more involved in the plot. But that's fine, since Blizzard has made some great comics and videos to give us more of the story's background. Really recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IsaacSlade,positive,9,Okay, I'd like to start off this review by reminding everyone that, while this game has seemingly little content, it comes cheaper than a lot of AAA titles in recent years that have roughly the same amount of content.

So I would say, think of it as a longOkay, I'd like to start off this review by reminding everyone that, while this game has seemingly little content, it comes cheaper than a lot of AAA titles in recent years that have roughly the same amount of content. Plus, Blizzard has said that everything that is added to the game from here on will be free (granted that might change, but I doubt it). So I would say, think of it as a long term investment where all you do is pay $40 up front, get eight maps, 4 game modes, and 21 unique heroes. To put that in perspective, $40 in a MOBA like League of Legends gets you maybe half that many characters, with only one map and game mode. So yes, Overwatch costs money for what doesn't seem like a lot of content. But compared to how much some people will spend in a supposedly Free-to-Play game, and especially compared to games that continue to charge you for new content, it's a great deal, and I believe it's a great investment, as well. Now, onto the part most people actually give a crap about: The gameplay. Every hero is unique in how they're played, and every character has their role to play. There are six Offense heroes, who are mostly fast and intended for close range combat, six Defense heroes, designed to remain in advantageous positions and prevent the enemy from taking their objective, five Tanks which have high health and defense (at the cost of lower attack) that are designed to soak up damage and protect their teammates, and four Support heroes which are designed to keep their allies alive and their enemies at a disadvantage. Some Heroes are a little more difficult to get the hang of than others, as they require quick reflexes, precision aiming, excellent timing, or prior planning if escape is needed. I could go into further detail about powers and weapons, but that'd take up more time than is necessary, so I won't. But the gameplay is solid and most of the characters are balanced (a couple of the tanks do more damage than they should, and some Ultimates are a little underpowered), and the game modes, while limited to four different types (payload escort, objective capture, king of the hill, and objective capture w/ payload escort) are all really fun, and so far every game I've played has been incredibly intense. No single player story, but really, what kind of story could you have for a game like this, anyways? On top of solid gameplay and interesting heroes, the game looks really nice, everything is nicely polished and the art style is very pleasant to look at.Not much else I can put on top of that, it just looks great. Overall, it's a fantastic game, and I have a feeling it'll be around for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would like to see major improvements to the competitive system which right now isn't rewarding and just not very fun unless you're playing with a full team which isn't reasonable for most people. Leavers are rampant as the penalty for leaving is so lenient, so you will often lose competitive ranks simply because a random on your team rage quit. Another major problem with ranked is people are too clumped, all the ranks aren't being used fully so you can have two people of the same rank who are miles apart in skill level, this leads to frustration when you're put with teammates who are the same rank but clearly not of the same skill, it's amazing how many people at SR60 seemingly don't care about winning and would rather pick their favourite hero even if it's being hard countered. The current hot topic is loot boxes, Blizzard originally stated all future cosmetic items would be available to be bought with currency, they have since gone back on this, updated their website and basically ignored the issue. Now we have limited edition boxes for the Summer games with unique items which are next to impossible to get without spending real life money, this has angered the community and rightly so, it's extremely scummy of Blizzard and it soured the entire event which otherwise was very enjoyable and this will clearly be their model going forward with future events, so expect to be disappointed every event when you don't get the skin you want because they won't allow you to spend your currency on it and you can't afford to drop £100 on RNG boxes (you can't simply buy what you want, you have to buy boxes and hope to get the item you want from 1000+ possibilities). The game also suffers with a host of hit registration issues which causes endless amounts of frustration, if you've played Overwatch for even an hour you've been hooked through walls, been killed around corners and died after activating a life saving ability simply because what the server sees and what you see are two very different things and the server thinks you never even pressed the key. If Blizzard can back off some of their greedy policies and fix competitive and the core gameplay issues then Overwatch could be amazing, if not it'll have a year or two and then fizzle out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the playable part is very nice. Lore and characters. Well, for people who like to know about the characters and their stories, it's obviously that they can to know it. However, the number of characters is reduced so options are too. But what I could say, they are charismatic and have interesting skills which can be countered if you know how to do it. Graphics: Meh, it's Blizzard, you know. The game is attractive as hell. Duration: We'll see, but in terms of fun, you'll have at least 80 to 100 hours of playing by the time (at this moment the game has no competitive mode and that sucks, but it will eventually arrive) Price: And this is the point because I can't give it an 9 or 10... For that quantity of content, I think 40€ is a very expensive price. But whatever, if people can pay that AND don't have another game to replace Overwatch.. do it. The good thing is that Overwatch will be updated periodically (or at least it's supposed to be) and this includes that the content will be expanded, in order to give the game more life, just as MMOs and others do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every map is polished and has great theming. In most FPS games the maps are dark and boring because it is a war zone, but in Overwatch all of the maps are colourful and vibrant and this makes gameplay way more interesting. Overall I cannot recommend Overwatch enough. Whilst the £30 price tag might put some off it is well worth it for the fun, exciting gameplay.

I've got at least 60+ games on my computer and I find myself forcibly prying this game away so that I can give my others a turn. The constant updates and free DLC make this a model in which all other gaming companies should take note of and aspire to live up to. The fact that it was only $40 from launch makes it a lot more palatable than the $60 norm. The gameplay and graphics style are stellar and feels extremely well polished. The fact that it doesn't include a ""single player"" or ""story mode"" is actually a plus for me", as I've found that a lot of games that have both tend to half-ass the single player and put most of their  development into the multiplayer, or vice versa. I'd rather have a dedicated team to making one truly amazing, and Blizzard has done that for me with this game. Despite the many characters and continuous additions, they somehow manage to keep it balanced, which blows my mind. I am absolutely obsessed and would recommend this to any fan of multiplayer first-person shooters. 11/10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is worth checking out for anyone. It's a video game that's invigorating and just does FUN right, which is something that a lot of games seem to overlook. Overwatch is an awesome game.

The characters feel very different from each other and trying out different ones is one of the fun part in this game. Teamplay is key - you need to contribute to the objective. Kill count doesn't matter at all. In fact, a match is won when the objective is completed, or the timer runs out, not when certain kill count has reached. The playability is top notch. It feels tight and responsive, nothing to **** about. But having such little content (4 game modes) I have my concerns whether this game will entertain me in the long run. I don't know. But so far I'm having a blast and I've only tried out 6 out of 21 characters so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rem,positive,10,It's been 5 hours straight and not once did my eyes leave the screen," constantly glued to the mayhem as my team pulled a victory after forcing overtime.

You won't find a compelling narrative or dozens of quests but what is here easily solidifies Overwatch's mark on gaming w/its perfected mechanics andIt's been 5 hours straight and not once did my eyes leave the screen"," constantly glued to the mayhem as my team pulled a victory after forcing overtime. Overwatch lacks ""traditional"" features that would normally create all time great games. You won't find a compelling narrative or dozens of quests but what is here easily solidifies Overwatch's mark on gaming w/its perfected mechanics and style that have become synonymous w/Blizzard's name. Overwatch’s strength lies in its simplicity and polish. Much like Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends", two teams of heroes battle on a handful of maps, and modes all boil down to some form of escorting, capturing, or protecting an objective. Other modes are available, but the game is at its best  keeping things close to the core, with maps everyone knows and easy-to-understand modes. While expectations today may call for a single-player campaign or a wide variety of modes, Overwatch’s consistently chaotic gameplay stands on its own, giving players the tools to ensure that no game ever plays out the same. These elements form the canvas where players paint unique experiences, match after match. One thing to celebrate about Overwatch is its imaginative cast of heroes, all of which are diverse and amazingly designed. They might not have pages of lore, but they all are insanely creative w/abilities that make sense to their character. Time-traveling Tracer spews quirky British quips as she blinks across the battlefield, while tanky Winston roars and pummels enemies as he leaps about. All of them have interesting personalities, and you'll favorite a good amount just by playing the game, a rare achievement for a multiplayer-only game. These heroes have unique skillsets that ensure no heroes play the same; you’re not just embracing the sniper rifle or the rocket launcher, but ability kits that come together to form each of the 24 heroes. This establishes that each character isn't relegated to a single role, but rather one that adapts to rapidly changing conditions, all without the need for a clunky progression system. Maps are also well designed and balanced, keeping the flow of action constant. This is all supported by controls that are quick and easy to get a hang of, and it speaks volumes to Blizzard's craft that all heroes feel perfect to play, not once did I get frustrated b/c of how a hero controlled. Whether it was playing point defense as Bastion or denying area control from the enemy as Junkrat, neither felt clunky to handle. Team play is the focus, and Overwatch encourages players to swap characters constantly to deal with the ever-evolving nature of a match. You and your friends can assemble a traditional or any combination of tank/support/damage group to push the payload to victory. Rallying together for a last second push to win the game after a brutal team wipe provides an enjoyment level equal if not more to the most engaging of videogame narratives. Actual progression is tied to the unlockable skins, emotes, sprays, and voice lines all earned by loot boxes at each subsequent level up. It's a fair system and the fact that Blizzard is onboard to support the game w/free updates and events in the years to come ensures that Overwatch is going to stay installed for the foreseeable future. Overwatch's visuals are lovely w/its colorful art style and simplicity. While there isn't buckets of gore or a menagerie of special effects, it's distinct and fitting to the universe Blizzard created. This approach also feeds into gameplay. Without an unnecessary amount of visual noise, it's easy to interpret what is going on even in the mayhem. The UI and menus are quick and clean to navigate, a rather underappreciated feature nowadays. The presentation is backed up by a spirited score which enhances the action, I felt like a kid watching his favorite heroes listening to the Victory theme, a feeling of both wonder and kickass unseen in many games. Audio cues by characters are also utilized to inform players of the shifting battlefield and whether or not an ally or enemy is unleashing their ultimate, which coupled w/excellent voice acting, further highlights the personalities of these heroes. For many gamers, it's easy to dismiss Overwatch as another multiplayer title lacking in features. While I do wished for a campaign that tapped into the potential of the story hinted, I'd ultimately rather have a game solely crafted from strong components than have a weak link dragging the game down. What Overwatch lacks in evolution, it exceeds in perfection of game enjoyment. Its profound ability to provide drastically different experiences with each hero ensures that fresh explorations and hours of renewed enjoyment are a single click away. Like watching your favorite heroes, Overwatch feels inspired and instills a genuine sense of fascination all w/o the need for a cutscene. It's polished panache and scores of fun will leave a legacy known for endless nights of entertainment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything is mostly there that you'd want from an arena shooter. I have some particular criticisms that I want to levy here, though.1.

Yet other abilities will 1 or 2 second gib enemies. Some weapons are 1HK! There seems a lack of consistency here, and the power of attacks isn't telegraphed (you'll have to learn all of this by playing many hours).2. The game doesn't communicate to you which weapons are hitscan and which are projectiles. Furthermore, the projectiles and hit boxes are much larger than they appear. It can be confusing for new players who don't understand the hitbox sizes.3. There's little incentive to master more than a couple of characters. they are all very different and you'll find that playing a character you aren't good at can make your team lose the match.4. Lack of competitive mode. It's a shame the game didn't launch with competitive. It's hugely important and will possibly effect the score of the game. The positives:1. Good voice acting. Every character has a good unique voice.2. Well optimized graphics.3. Interesting weapons and abilities. There's something for everyone.4. Good cosmetic purchase options.

But I am giving it a 10 anyway because: - Gameplay is awesome, neither hardcore or casual players get frustrated since team composition is required and encouraged naturally- Sound design is intelligent!- This game's marketing campaign and media released content hasLet me start by stating that my real rating for this game is an 8, due to the slightly unrewarding progression system. But I am giving it a 10 anyway because: - Gameplay is awesome, neither hardcore or casual players get frustrated since team composition is required and encouraged naturally- Sound design is intelligent!- This game's marketing campaign and media released content has to be praised, it was massive! Hype was real for thousands of people (and we all know that hype sells even bad games). This may be the reason for low user scores though, because hype is often the cause of unrealistic or impatient expectations.- Many reviewers are too extreme and gave this game low scores... if this game was a 0, then those really bad games or those that are corporate scams (pay to win, DLC story mode, gameplay affecting microtransactions, unbalanced fights, etc) need a new measuring scale.- The price was adapted here, making me able to buy it. In my case, I live in a country where games are really expensive and take a large portion of the average salary... this game was kind of expensive, but I payed only $8 more than what I payed for Rocket League (RL is actually $20).- I've already spent 22 hours playing Overwatch, which is more than what it took me to finish Far Cry 3 (a full priced game, with non farovable currency adaptation here, it costed around 1/10 of my wage). And I consider myself a casual player (have to work on weekdays and also take care of my home first)- Developers are not ignoring what the community says, I've only seen this coming from indie developers in the past. Cons: You have already read most important ones from the rest of the reviews and from angry gamers;- Progression system could be better (we are waiting for Ranked Mode)- Price is high, I know I praised the conversion here, but globally it is (not a single close friend or coworker bought it, only friends from other countries did). Bad reviews are not deserved and do not help into this matter.- Game needs more skins variety, as well as some fun clothing accesories (Hats!) That's all... An 8/10 with chances to become a 10/10.A childish and unmature 10/10 here on Metacritic because ridiculously low scores are also childish and unfair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is fast paced and very fun. There isn't one moment in a match where I feel like I am doing nothing. All that I ask of the game now is that they have skins for the weapons apart from the skins themselves, so that everyone has different combinations of body skins as well as weapon skins.

It is astonishing to read all these haters on the user review section who just blurt BS out of their behinds... I havent played a competitive FPS for a few years and I am having a blast with this new IP from Blizz.  It is pretty BS to see people giving this the worst score possible of 0 because that score should be reserved for games which are broken to the point of being unplayable...  I havent suffered from any crash or bug in my play time.  It has a pretty good voice chat system.  the characters were well polished and balanced enough at launch.  The match making is quick. My only complaint is the lack of competitive match making at launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YourMumWashes,positive,8,I was sceptical about this game, i thought it would be blatant copy of TF2, and partially i was right, but after 80 hours or so i must tell that its pretty damn good and much better than TF2. It may borrow best parts from other games (classes from TF2 and skills from MOBA games) but it combines them into something better than sum of its parts. Despite some generic game modesI was sceptical about this game, i thought it would be blatant copy of TF2, and partially i was right, but after 80 hours or so i must tell that its pretty damn good and much better than TF2. It may borrow best parts from other games (classes from TF2 and skills from MOBA games) but it combines them into something better than sum of its parts. Despite some generic game modes (attack/defend, push payload or control) its really fun and ejoyable to play. Gameplay is very fluid, graphics are cartoonish in a good way, characters are likable, diverse and they work in a rock-paper-scissors manner, so it encourages to play different classes and wisely change them during matches. I like this. I also like that fact that some characters are quite hard to play and require practice (Tracer, Genji), which is fine considered overall gameplay is quite basic and simple and game caters to casual players. What i dont like? Few things. The first is quite bad match-making and huge number of weak/dumb players, in my or enemy team, which causes majority of matches to be one-sided. Rarely i play good, thrilling match.The second thing i dont like is small number of maps, heroes etc. This game simply lacks content, which is kinda strange considering its high price.Also Blizzard is not good at balancing things, some characters are clearly better at many tasks, while the others designed only for some roles feel underwhelming. For example the last nerf of Mccree was overdone, it made him very weak, which i dont mind, but this also caused other problems, like dominance of tanks (Rein and Hog) and agile assassins like Tracer/Genji, who now have no real counter.The last thing is total lack of any progression system, unlocks etc. Its nice i can choose from all characters without having to unlock them first, but some kind of progression would be nice.But these flaws dont change the fact, that game is very fun to play, addicting and well polished.Its probably not the best game this year, but i bet it will be the longest played game by me this year.8/10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I giveUltimately, what it comes down to with Overwatch is that almost everyone who plays it has a ton of fun with it, and ends up playing the game a lot. The game looks good, sounds good, and feels great to play. It's accessible but rewards mastery. I give Overwatch a 10/10 rating not because I believe it is perfect, or because it has everything that I could possibly want it to have. I give it that rating because I give it my highest recommendation. I think if you enjoy arena shooters, it's virtually guaranteed that you will enjoy and get your money's worth out of playing  Overwatch. And if you don't enjoy arena shooters... you might still love Overwatch. It's a game of superlative quality, and any criticisms you can level at it simply will not change that brute fact. Although I see where a lot of the criticisms of the game are coming from," I think they're mostly off-base. People say the game is ""incomplete."" This is true in the sense that it is in active development. I do not feel that it is true in the sense that the game lacks sufficient features or content to provide a full", satisfactory experience for the majority of players who try it. People say that the game is derivative -- most commonly, they say that it is derivative of TF2. This is true to a limited extent, but does not constitute a substantive criticism. Team Fortress 2 is about a decade old now -- it is high time we've seen a modern iteration on the concept. Further, Overwatch is highly distinct from TF2 in the way it plays, not to mention the way it looks. People criticize the game on its business model -- saying that it should be F2P, or that it should be less expensive, or that it should not feature microtransactions. While I have some quibbles myself with the microtransaction system (I refuse to pay real money to gamble for digital goods), I think the business model is generally a healthy, pro-consumer one that will facilitate active development of the game without bleeding customers dry. Ultimately, you're paying $40 for a multiplayer game that is tons of fun for 100+ hours or easily more, and which is in active development. You can pay more for cosmetic features, but unlocking a fair number of the cosmetics that you want through gameplay is only a moderate grind by, say, F2P standards. Having a progression system that people have some incentive to care about even if they are not serious try-hard players, but which does not affect gameplay is likely good for the long-term health of the game -- as fun as it is, having something to work towards is compelling and satisfying. The game is not flawless, but criticisms of the game's value proposition strike me as misguided. You can ask for a perfectly polished $40 game with 30+ heroes, 20+ maps, a single player campaign, tons of great cosmetics out of the box, no microtransactions, ongoing support and a robust competitive scene... or you could live in reality and appreciate that as far as value for your money goes, it doesn't get much better than Overwatch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have expanded on the character selection drastically and the variation in gameplay comes in the form of your opponents character selections.  with 21 (22 soon) characters to choose from each game feels different than the last. To all the critics yelling about class balancing, they just don't know how to play the game.  Every class has an answer.  The people complaining about imbalances probably have not explored each character to their full potential.  It is an extremely well balanced and fair game. Plus, it's just fun.  Admittedly waaaay more fun if you have a group you can communicate with.  The in-game VOIP sounds very clear, but rarely do you get a pub group where more than one or two people actually talk.  I typically play in discord with a full team of 6, which is always satisfying. If you're on the fence about purchasing this game, don't listen to the negative reviews about it being a TF2 clone.  TF2 is a 9 year old GREAT game, but Overwatch has expanded on that game type immensely.

I also liked the art style. It's friendly, pretty, and very Pixar-like. But the best part are the characters. Some have VERY small balancing issues, but they are all well balanced and each character has their counters. Not only that, but no one character does the same thing, each one does unique stuff. Tracer can dash around and rewind time while blasting enemies with her pistols, Widowmaker snipes and is able to tell the team of enemy locations, D.va uses a mech to be the aggressor, blasting her way through enemies, and Zenyatta is able to turn enemies to butter with his discord orb. And what I really give a lot of credit to Blizzard for is how alive the characters are. Each have a personality that makes them as unique as their abilities. Personally, my favorite is Tracer. So, should you buy it? I mean, I thought it was worth it, and I have a lot of fun with my friends. But it's not a game meant for everybody. Each match can be 5 - 15 minutes long, meaning if you ever have a bit of time, you can play a single match before doing what needs to be done. Just don't get the Origins Edition unless you REALLY want those skins. I got the regular edition for 40 dollars, and it was worth every penny. If you love multiplayer, or want to try and get back into multiplayer, then Overwatch is the game for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seriously, look at the interface and compare it with TF2. You will understand that Overwatch is for people. Thank you, Blizzard Entertainment, for another masterpiece!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

quadratrix,positive,9,I've never been great at competitive multiplayer, always sitting around the bottom 3 in after-game rankings. Yet in Overwatch, I managed to achieve 'Play of the Game' with my Hero, Zarya, on my third night of play. Gamers of all abilities are allowed to shine in Overwatch, and this is its greatest strength.

If you have a team mindset, and know your role, you're well on the road to victory. Where in Halo or CoD, you're dead in the blink of an eye, Overwatch lets you stay in the game longer. Heroes have a generous amount of health, with plenty of opportunity to retreat, recover, and charge back into the fray. The game rewards creative thinking, and hatching plans - not just twitch reflexes. I want to play Overwatch every night. I think about it at work, and before I fall asleep. I talk about it to my wife and friends. Overwatch is pure gaming at its best. Meanwhile, Uncharted 4 sits uncompleted, somewhere in my pile of games, a boring anachronism...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scheelio,positive,9,First, I want address some of the common complaints about this game: 1. No story/campaign - This shouldn't be a surprise. I don't understand how people complain about this, when it's been VERY clear from the start that this is PvP only game.2. Not enough content - I can understand this complaint...at the moment. It is a little light on modes/maps. But, I see this as an investment -First, I want address some of the common complaints about this game: 1. No story/campaign - This shouldn't be a surprise. I don't understand how people complain about this, when it's been VERY clear from the start that this is PvP only game. 2. Not enough content - I can understand this complaint...at the moment. It is a little light on modes/maps. But, I see this as an investment - I trust that Blizzard will deliver with more characters, modes, and maps in the future. If you can't make that gamble, then I guess you won't be playing the game. 3. It should be free to play (F2P) - Couple reasons that I'm glad it isn't: 1) prevents bots/hackers from flooding the game (this is huge), and 2) in this team-based class shooter, I don't know how you could have a 'free' hero rotation. You would see the same heroes in every game and that would limit the team comps drastically. It would also cause this game to be pay to win, as a team that has all the heroes available vs. a team that doesn't would have a HUGE advantage. Now, with that over, I want to tell you what I like and don't like about the game: PROS:- Gameplay is fantastic. Fan. Tas. Tic. After all, this is what make a game actually fun to play, and this game has it in spades.- It runs great. Granted, I have a nice system, so I wasn't worried at all, but even so, I haven't had a single issue with them game. I also have run it on my older system and it played great on that one, too.- Character design is amazing. I can't stress enough to people that haven't played how unique each of the characters are in this game. Everyone excels at different styles of play and none of them feel like they overlap. It's really astonishing how they pulled that off.- It's a Blizzard game. What I mean by that is Blizzard has a knack for knowing how to keep a community going, so I have full faith that this game will be going strong two years down the line (and probably longer). CONS:- Loot boxes. I don't mind loot boxes, in general," but I do think I should be able to ""trade"" a skin for another skin of the same rarity. Or", at least, let me cash in skins to buy the skin that actually want, even if I don't get full value for the traded-in skins. Right now, the only way to get credits to get them randomly in loot boxes and for duplicate items (again, randomly in loot boxes).- This isn't a real con, as it can be overcome with a good comp and coordinated team, but in general, teams on defense have a distinct advantage. I have a feeling this won't be as much of an issue when ranked play comes out, as players will focus more on the objectives than running off and trying to rack up solo kills (hopefully). Overall: I really enjoy this game. I don't come from an FPS background. In fact, I will say I don't play FPS at all. But this game allows me to jump in and contribute in a support role and makes it very fun to do so, at the same time. I would recommend anyone playing this game - even if you don't play shooters.. In the 20+ hours that I've played so far," I can say that I've never had this much fun in an online competitive game. The best/worst part about this game is that it has that ""just one more match"" hook. It melts away the hours and when you're not playing it", all you can think about is when you can play it again. Between this and Rocket League, I might never play another game again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My personal favorite is Tracer, she's a great distraction while my team continues to do the objective. This game is so fun I enjoy playing as a support character, which i'm typically terrible at. Like Lucio doesn't even feel like a support character even though he is great at it with his health and speed boosts. This game really started to get hype and I didn't want to believe it but now I can't stop playing it. The only reason its not a 10 is because it's pretty expensive for a game with no single-player mode. So if you happened to like Team Fortress 2, I suggest buying this game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would like to address the fact that many people believe Overwatch is a ""ripoff"" of Team Fortress 2 but I disagree. Overwatch doesn't truly copy much of Team Fortress 2", with the exception of game types and certain character abilities. Most of Overwatch's characters are much more creatively designed and diversified than all of TF2's characters. Each character has a unique playstyle and varies vastly from that of TF2. I prefer Overwatch over TF2 any day, mainly for the fact that it is much more colorful and it is more fun to play. The atmosphere is beyond amazing and it is an amazing first person shooter set to fit the needs of many different types of gamers. Some of the lore doesn't make sense but the game isn't meant to focus on lore. It requires teamwork and a proper selection and combination of heroes. If I had one complaint it would be that it can be hard to find a good match with players who refuse to compose a team correctly. 10/10 much better than TF2 and has earned the right to be an original game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lone_Wolf_Sones,positive,9,Overwatch is Blizzard's take on the FPS (First Person Shooter). However to simply call the game a first person shooter would be a disservice.

However to simply call the game a first person shooter would be a disservice. Blizzard has crafted a game in this emergent genre of 'hero shooters/arena shooters; that borrows the best ideas from other games in the genre like Team Fortress 2. Blizzard has put their own spin on it to make it a fresh experience. The art style is fantastic too and is primed for a feature length film. It really is some gorgeous stuff and I don't think its an stretch to say that the visuals themselves would look at home in a Pixar film. The performance is rock solid as well. The game has been incredibly well optimized and features one of the most robust suites of options I have seen in a PC game. This feels like it was built from the ground up for PC. You can customize damned near any key. You also can adjust key-bindings at the hero level. Yup, you have a set of key-bindings for each of the 21 heroes currently in the game. You can also customize the shape, and color of the on screen reticle. Its this attention to detail that shows in just about every area of the game. Overwatch centers its focus on its heroes and how their abilities can be used with and against other heroes. Its focus on team composition and allowing you to swap heroes gives the game incredible depth and an underlying layer of player choice and strategy. The game features a variety of modes such as training, practices vs. AI, as well as quick play. Within these modes the actual game types themselves can consist of things like payload (familiar to fans of TF2), capture point and King of the hill style matches. One of the criticisms leveled against the game is lack of content. I would agree with this statement if it was in regards to the number of modes themselves. But not every game needs a single player campaign. I feel that with the number of heroes on display here," a single player campaign would have diluted the multiplayer experience. Jeff Kaplan of Blizzard also pointed out that support heroes like Mercy would be tough to work into a single player campaign because of their nature as support heroes. I would like to see more modes added over time. Perhaps Capture the flag. I don't think Team Death-match would fit well either. Blizzard has smartly decided to de-emphasize kills and kdr in favor of promoting team play. What is odd however is that the majority of the 'play of the game' are from people/heroes who rack up a lot of kills. The game features a commendation system which on its own doesn't really mean much. But it can be nice to get commendations from your team mates if you do a good job of healing. It also has things like ""damage blocked."" It is a way of saying hey look how well you did your job", or performed your role. The game features a progression system that gives you a loot box when you level up. These drops can be anything ranging from currency to skins, avatars, sprays, voice lines or victory poses. Its all superfluous but it is a nice way of customizing your character and making it your own. The game does have micro-transactions but these are only for loot boxes which are at the end of the day cosmetic stuff and don't impact the game itself. My initial concern is that the more games you play the higher the chance you will get duplicates from loot boxes. Fortunately those duplicates do reward you gold which can then be used towards something else you don't have. In the end Overwatch is a fantastic well crafted game despite needing a few more modes. Blizzard have created a solid platform to build upon and have stated that future heroes and maps will be free which is very welcome indeed. Multiplayer only games can struggle to find success. Overwatch however has enough depth in its gameplay that it never felt repetitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I find TF2 to be (for lack of a better word) funnier. I am constantly laughing at the things I see people doing and for a game as mature as TF2 that's amazing. Overwatch which I am still getting used to is a crazy fast game (maybe I'm just getting old) but I find myself gravitating towards the support classes so the young twitchy players can handle the front line offense. The only reason I didn't rate Overwatch a 10 is because it seems to me that there aren't very many people playing it. I'm in Silicon Valley and I was pretty surprised when I found myself playing skirmish for almost 10 minutes before getting dropped into a game. When that game ended I was dumped back into skirmish because there were 'not enough players'. This was not in the early morning or very late night... it was evening on the west coast. I will be playing a LOT more Overwatch. Great game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm just gonna say they're COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY WRONG. Overwatch takes a lot of inspiration from multiple other titles, such as TF2 or MOBAs. It's not ripping them off and if you have played the game, you know this is true. The game itself blends all these influences together greatly, creating an incredibly fun gameplay loop playable for a long time. I have 150 hours on TF2 and it did get boring after some time. Now, I've been playing Overwatch for three months, I have 50 hours and I'm not even getting close to being bored. That's how good the gameplay (which this entire game is based on) is. Even after 50 hours I'm still excited to play the next round. There's more than enough variety for the game to keep being fun. It's much better to have fourteen great maps than 50 pointless mazes, isn't that right, TF2? The maps are also the only thing that gets a tiny bit repetitive. The characters themselves are vastly different from each other, original and so much fun to play. I do not understand why some of the female ones are so sexualized, but I don't let that take away my enjoyment for this game. Plus, the creators care very much about the game and address many of these issues as well as they update the game with new features, events and heroes. The art style of Overwatch is great too. The Blizzard polish works very well for this game and gives it also some originality. Speaking of Blizzard, YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET ABOUT IT!!!

Sometimes other problems take a long time to be fixed, especially problems with the ranked game-mode. Lack of greed/anti-consumerism: 9.5/10: I think the free monthly DLC justifies the hefty price tag. The developers have given gifts to players, that would normally cost 1-5$.  When Blizzard accidentally made it too hard to get the limited-edition cosmetics during the anniversary event, the gave the players a double XP weekend to make up for it. The only reason that i'm not giving full marks here, is that there are micro-transactions in the game. Public relations/Taking community suggestions: 7.5/10: Blizzard is quick to patch bugs, but other flaws in the game can take months to iron out. The lead game director is active on the forums, and frequently hints at new updates, or replies to complaints/suggestions. Design/Long term enjoyment: 10/10: I absolutely love the design of this game. It has always stayed fresh for me after playing for 30 minutes to 3 hours nearly every day since launch. The diverse roster of characters, all with unique abilities and lots of cosmetics keeps me having fun, after multiple hours of playing. One players begin to tire out, a new major update comes and refreshes a game. If you are looking for a game to invest a lot of time into, this is the game. It manages to take the fun mechanics of a FPS game, but not be repetitive, unlike Call of Duty, or Counter-Strike. Stability: 7/10: The servers don't crash very often, but it takes a long time to download updates right after they are released, as the servers are overwhelmed. Multiple times I have had to wait in a queue to join the main servers, which is completely unacceptable in a game that was nearly one year old (At the time), especially if the game costs 40$. There has only been one major bug that required disabling a character for a short amount of time, but otherwise the game it's self has been fairly stable. Dealing with cheaters: 9/10: Not once have I had to deal with cheaters, but there have been some reports of cheaters at very high levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However it is poor of content and some characters are too strong. [Graphic] The game is really good to watch, every character is different, the stages are huge and with cartoon style Overwatch is unique. [Gameplay] Overwatch is a MOBA-FPS style, some heroes do more damage, others heal, build torrets etc.There are four different game modes: quick play, competitive, arcade and find game. I want to discuss about the last two, the arcade has five more modes that can change after some days or weeks, while find game is a custom mode where you can create or join into other matches. Unfortunately in the main modes, quick match and competitive, there are only two types of matches, we have the payload (you can also find it on Team Fortress 2) where the players must escort it until the last position to win the game, while the other team must stops the opponents. The second is capture and defend a point, i don't have to say anything because it is really simple to understand. Too many unbalanced heroes, from the moment this is half MOBA and it is half FPS, it's hard to balance all characters. [No story mode] There isn't a story mode but at the same time, this title has a story but it is hidden, you need to understand the connections between characters and stages. [Conclusions] Overwatch is one of the most famous games," it surpassed League Of Legends on Twitch and sometimes it still the most streamed title on the platform. I don't feel like it is ""Orrible"" from all sides", it has some good aspects and others are bad, but it really is funny to play. If you like the art style and other stuffs i suggest to you to buy it. Pros: Unique game graphic style;easy to understand the game mechanics;a new way to represent a FPS;so many characters and stages;so many unlockable items. Cons: After one year from the release, there only four additional characters;some problems with the matchmaking;from the moment this is based on MOBA style, there are too many toxic players;only two game modes for the quick play and competitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same goes with underpowered/overpowered characters. Many times they ship an unbalanced character into PTR and ship it to the main game without hearing the concerns of fans. The other big issue is the toxicity of the community, especially in competitive. Other than that, the new content being added is great, and the game is generally enjoyable.

What I really like about this game, you have COD character (soldier 76) Red Dead Character(McCree) and now you have skyrim spellcaster character(Moira) so on... This is what sold me on this game. Can't forget about the YEAR OF THE LOOTBOX, nasty those things are. Yes they are cosmetic, but... why do I need to gamble for them? Can't I earn them through in game achievements, instead of grinding for the same spray you have unlocked 5 time... if this game would of left of out lootboxes, might of been 10/10 for me. Been playing this game since it came out, and I've been enjoying all the new content they have been putting out. Helps the game feel fresh and it is technically free content... Hopefully you get that skin you want, because you only have 3 weeks to unlock it. Other then that problem very enjoyable game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

И большинство этих отзывов не имеет никакой конструктивной критики," это просто поливание грязью...Ещё больше меня раздражают комментарии типа :""эта игра должна быть бесплатной"". Почему?? Если OW должна быть f2p", то за игру в CS:GO вам вообще должны платить деньги! Я играю в OW уже почти 2 года, то есть с его релиза (сделал предзаказ). За это время много чего поменялось: добавили новые карты, персонажей, разные облики, правили баланс (хоть и не всегда удачно). Также есть полно отличных короткометражек и официальных комиксов по игре," рекомендую их почитать! Играю на ранге ""Алмаз"" начиная со второго сезона. Могу с уверенностью сказать", что обычно негативные отзывы оставляют, так сказать, нубы. То есть они ноют потому, что не разобрались в механике игры или не умеют контрить определённых героев, из-за чего появляется их любимый дисбаланс. Кстати, негативных людей на низких рангах тоже намного больше. Сейчас в игре почти всё идеально, но как и большинство онлайн игр она бывает сильно выводит из себя, из-за чего хочется винить игру, а не свой скилл или везение. Единственные проблемы: бан за мейнерство, даже если ты играешь хорошо и, пожалуй, небольшой дисбаланс отдельных героев. Но так как меня эти проблемы не затронули, то я ставлю 10/10.

There's not that much in it anyways. The gunplay is ok, not great. most of the guns feel weak. A lot of the game is based off communication, which there usually isn't. There isn't a problem of hackers, but I've seen people completely pubstomp games with 50+ eliminations, usually as reaper, genji or bastion. Bastion isn't OP, it's that he's easy to play and the skill level required to beat him is a bit more substantial than the skill required to play him. Supports are well done, surprisingly. Most of them feel balanced, with a good skill ceiling availible for ambitous players. defense heroes are alright. Bit dull overall, with mei being an exception. I'm seeing way too many ultimates though, and unfortunately I see so many more offensive ones it's usually normal to see entire teams getting wiped out by 3 simultaneous ultimates. while mercy might only pop her ult once per round. Supports aren't building their ults fast enough. Tanks are surprisngly fun, with a lot of tactics involved other than running straight into enemy fire.Graphically i'm split. It looks great, with animation-like models and great environments. The optmization is also really good, running on lower end machines as well. My main problem is that a lot of the effects are too jarring. The screen can easily be filled with all sorts of visual effects, making it impossible to see what's happening.Mechanically it's good. The game modes are fair, with good amounts of opprunity on both sides for most games. I will say that payload maps need a rework. I'm seeing way too many bottlenecks where the game just freezes there until 3 or 4 ults are popped.Most maps are fine. None of them are very good though. It would pay to look at other games that have done maps well before. Please fix the jump animations. They make me feel terrible, like they have bobble heads or rigid spines.With friends? This game is amazing. The atmosphere the game creates is great. However I will say that the servers aren't great, so if some friends aren't in the same country, let alone region, I'd advise against playing with them.the music is ok. Honestly i thought Blizzard could do better but it's fine. it works and the tension is there near the end of the rounds. but it's bland compared to the overall theme of the game.Customization is great. Lots of taunts, voice clips, alternate costumes and sprays, although a good amount of the skins are just different colour schemes. The voice acting is superb, especially when the characters talk to each other during the preparation period.Almost no community made items though. no private servers or custom maps or private matches. A bit disappointed but really I've been spoilt by Valve letting me host whatever i want. L4D2," CSGO and TF2 al have a thriving community creating new stuff. Blizzard could release an Asset maker for us. That'd be fun.It's fun. There's competitive. There are few hackers. Graphically and stylistically it's great.But this score is how much i enjoyed it.And I think it's a great game. I  might update my score after more content is released but right now not much is making me go ""Hey I want to go back to Overwatch"" and play more of it. It's hella fun", and when there's synergy, it works. But most of the time it's as if I've already played this before. i don't know whether the amount of content coming is worth staying on for, or Blizzard is just gonna take the SFV route and delay content but 30 quid isn't getting me much. I look forward to seeing what Blizzard does and whether it updates my score but a 7 is what I think it's worth.EDIT 2018The game has, as i had hoped, significant content patches with new maps n heroes. I can now say you can easily justify the price tag the game has.  However, problems are still there, and I will talk about how it can still improve.my initial review in 2016 said that a lot of the mechanics were good. I feel that it has only improved,with blizzard slowly tuning it so that the online feel is much more cohesive. Each hero feels a bit more consistent, with viability and strategy matching the map and skills you're on. i also appreciate the continued optimization. It still runs beautifully and i think that it does stand head and shoulders with DOOM/Warframe as one of the best running games you can get. Blizzard also gets a thumbs up for allowing server browser, better custom modes, arcade modes. These are the things that every multiplayer shooter should have and I'm glad that these features are now available. Servers are better, though i still recommend only playing with friends in the same region.However, i still have a few problems. Toxic players are part of any online game, but dealing with people who queue together is a hassle and I leave games to avoid toxic groups. The graphics are still far too flashy, making it difficult to pinpoint targets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nel,positive,7,Blizzard usually makes well made games, and this is no exception. However, for me the game feels very repetitive.

Telembrium,negative,2,Overwatch is a game which has a good concept but a bad implementation. Poor map and mechanics design, poor graphics, a serious lack of writing talent, a featureless matchmaking system, and the microtransactions added on top are all factors which have contributed to Overwatch's failure to provide a fun experience. With a single sentence, the closest one can get to describing the massiveOverwatch is a game which has a good concept but a bad implementation. Poor map and mechanics design, poor graphics, a serious lack of writing talent, a featureless matchmaking system, and the microtransactions added on top are all factors which have contributed to Overwatch's failure to provide a fun experience. With a single sentence, the closest one can get to describing the massive amount of illogical, arbitrary, inconsistent, and counter-intuitive design that Overwatch is rife with using an example from the game is," ""Bear traps prevent time travel."" The base design of the game is both unique and functional", but where the developers go wrong is in the specifics. There's the apex of stupidity that is the mentioned example, but the game suffers no lack of design that exists within the same philosophy. I could prattle off countless instances: contact-detonated explosives being reflected with contact, electromagnetic pulses preventing running and yet not affecting rolls or jetpacks, flash bangs which immobilise players and violate the law of conservation of energy by nullifying all momentum while not affecting vision whatsoever—the list goes on. This design causes immense frustration for those learning the game and continues to be an annoyance long into a player's career. The game's graphics are a mixed bag. Textures are blurry and many models could benefit from an increased polycount. Still, the cartoonish art style manages to keep the game looking passable and at times even pretty. Animations are basic, often lacking enough frames to look smooth. There is absolutely no lip-sync and only minor modelling of facial expressions, so characters will not open their mouths when speaking, and those on the brink of death simply look bored or slightly irritated. Granted, this level of graphical fidelity does allow for higher framerates, but crisp textures and higher polycount models should be available for those who have the systems to handle them. Map design in Overwatch is shockingly poor. The majority of the maps use one of two game modes: Attack/Defence and KoTH. Both of these game modes are inherently flawed, as the game balance is wildly skewed without a mobile point of battle. Most A/D and KoTH matches devolve into spawn camping or repeatedly walking into a kill box. Additionally, the developers have added countless bottomless pits to the maps in places that make no sense for the sake of having them for certain character's abilities. The remaining maps utilise a payload game mode, which plays well but is still plagued by random pits. The game's writing is awful. Characters can have their entire backstory described with a single sentence: Mercy is a Swiss doctor that abhors violence, Zarya is a strong, Russian woman, DoomFist is a black man that steals things," and McCree is a cowboy. These sensational designs are among the many ""heroes"" that Blizzard uses as one of the game's selling points. Like the character designs", the story is near nonexistent. The best that can be ascertained is that there was an international policing organisation which was disbanded after failing at their job, and now the ex-members are teaming up with known criminals to fight clones of themselves. By far, the largest issue that besets Overwatch is the lack of a sophisticated matchmaking system. The current system could tentatively be called functional, but even that is a stretch. It lacks basic features such as map and ping filtering, and the matches it creates are frequently unbalanced. It will reconnect players to matches that they have manually disconnected from, making it impossible to escape trolls and cheaters without waiting several minutes for the slots to be refilled. You'll also be punished for leaving matches through the application of a reduced XP penalty. This is mostly irrelevant, but it leaves the player feeling scorned when the reason they're disconnecting is the game's fault. If all the previous failings weren't bad enough, get ready to be milked for every cent you're worth with microtransactions. Loot boxes and loot are constantly advertised. Labels proclaiming 'New!' are everywhere," and even the in-game menu offers you the ability to disconnect from the match (with punishment) to buy or open loot boxes. The items these loot boxes hold are thankfully cosmetic but don't fail to break the artstyle. People running around in gaudy outfits and Halloween costumes and yells of ""Would you like the sponge or the spray?"" are no stranger to the combat of Overwatch. Many items are memes and/or break the fourth wall. In short", Overwatch is a good game concept with bad game design. Arbitrary mechanic design, poor map design, poor writing, well-performing yet poor quality graphics, a barely functional matchmaking system that punishes the player for its failures, and microtransactions as a rotten cherry on top of an ant-ridden ice cream sundae make it clear to label this game with the bottom line of: Avoid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The characters are colorful, the style is amazing, and the lore is deep and complex. The problem is that the characters, lores, and stylized cutscenes are not in the game. No, reviewing this game as a game leaves me feeling a bit offset. As a universe, Overwatch is amazing, simply mindblowing, and brings a bit of everything to the table, great characters, lores, fans, exc. As a game, well it's lackluster. The game itself is a simple first person shooter with two teams of six. That's it. Each hero plays differently and counters another and so on, blah blah blah, we've all heard that before. Point is, as a game, it's repetitive and lacks any sort of story element. It also deals with a full price tag, for which it feels empty. Furthermore, you don't just GET the things you buy. Yes, you get the full game, but getting all the pieces of the game include more than your share of fully duplicate loot boxes, and the pure annoyance that comes from them. This is not a solo game. You do not play this game for an engaging plot or interesting mechanics or deep lore and gameplay. No, you play this game with your friends. And that brings about the multiplayer issues with the game. Put simply, casual is full of trolls (but that's to be expected in any multiplayer game) and the brawls (special gamemodes that rotate in and out) feel unbalanced and underwhelming. So the only real way to play the game is competitively, and that is a mess. In the next season, they say they'll clear things up, but from the beta testers, Season 2 doesn't look any better than the first. The ranking system is messed up, skewed HARD in favor of those with dps skills and beefy computers. Healers get nothing, even though they are integral to winning a game. Ranked is bad. Very bad. Casual is only slightly better. Long story short, Overwatch would be a 0 if not for the extra, out-of-game universe. If not for the cinematics and comics that keep me interested in the characters, I would not play the game. As it is, I only bought it to play with my friends... and I wouldn't keep playing if I had the choice. But after the hefty cost of entry, 40-60 bucks, I can't just put the game down. They promised me stuff, so I'll get stuff. I'll just enjoy the extra universe more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PizzaW0lf,positive,7,Now that the hype has settled I think I should give a fair analysis on this game and whether or not it's worth the $40-$60 you will spend. One thing that I LOVE about this game is how easy it is to play. No confusing menus or other crap I don't care, just simple click what you want which is vital in an action packed game like this. The characters REALLY stand out. I love all of them!Now that the hype has settled I think I should give a fair analysis on this game and whether or not it's worth the $40-$60 you will spend. One thing that I LOVE about this game is how easy it is to play. No confusing menus or other crap I don't care, just simple click what you want which is vital in an action packed game like this. The characters REALLY stand out. I love all of them! (except MEI I HATE HER) All of them have there own charm and make the game even more fun. The art style is also nice but pretty basic. And the maps are seriously the best maps for a multiplayer shooter like Overwatch. But a big problem I have with the game is how lacking in content it really is. Especially for a $40-$60 game. PLEASE BLIZZARD, ADD IN A STORY MODE! Also I think this game really didn't diverse GOTY in 2016. And just for the fact it got THAT award makes this game feel a little OVERRATED. Sorry  ¯_(ツ)_/¯. Overall I would recommend. PS, this game runs SUPER well on most computers that are pretty good in terms of graphical power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EviL-X,positive,8,Very fun game, good looking, gameplay is great. Characters for the most part balanced, Servers are also pretty good, had almost no lag at all. fluid game no lag in the game either always 70fps ? I think It's locked for me but I'm not sure. anyway a lot of fun with that game. Only multiplayer though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thornep,negative,3,The main problem I have with this game is that its matchmaking is AWFUL, at least in solo queue (and holy hell Arcade modes are just unplayable and everything gets even worse after 10pm).

Almost every match is a complete washout for one side or the other, depending on whether the MM has decided you should win or lose. New players, prepare your anus because the matchmaking only (allegedly) tries to match aggregate skill on the two teams. That means that a bad player can and WILL get thrown in a match where almost everyone is much better as long as the magic algorithm thinks that the approximate team skill levels are balanced. Leaving aside the point I made above that matches are almost always garbage in solo-queue, even a near even match between teams will be a complete joyless pain if you are just fodder for the enemy team, and that's what is going on. Try logging on to some of the modes anywhere after about 8pm and watch what you'll get- one team around level 100 (or less) each against 3-5 people above 400lvls of experience. Pre-made teams against randoms. It's not a gg. So what I said before about matching the average skill of a team is BS," they don't even come close. It would be great if the vaunted ""critic reviews"" actually looked at things like matchmaking. ((Oh", and if you encounter the same jack@ss again and again griefing his own team," you can't do anything about it because they took out the ""avoid player"" button because toxic AHs were upset that no one wanted to play with them. The excuse is that ""good players were being avoided because no one wanted to get beaten by them"" but the SENSIBLE solution would have been to make ""avoid this player"" avoid having him on YOUR team. But Blizzard is either lazy", stupid, or loves to keep their games full of idiots griefing each other. Is mei walling his own team? How about teleporters that lead off cliffs?)) see below EDIT 3/25/18: Overwatch has now implemented a feature that allows you to avoid players on your team, just as many have suggested. HOWEVER, they limit you to two people. Two people out of how many players? And it lasts only 7 days. in the announcement they posted they said they are going to look at queue times and might increase the number. Hopefully they will increase it. And unfortunately there is no story, no plot, no solo or co-op play of any relevance so if you are put off by the crap matches you get, there is no point in playing. Really, the only way to play this game and have any fun is with multiple friends- the more the better so that you can defeat Blizzard's garbage matchmaking. But why give blizzard money for their lazy practices? Also, Genji is cancer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TacticalKnight,positive,6,"This is the most objectively accurate game review ever made in regards to Overwatch. That these so-called ""game journalists"" are your typical shills that can't even finish a Cuphead tutorial and try to pass themselves off as gamers. They are the cancerous casuals that plague the gaming industry and are the major reason why the gaming industry needs another crash. I have played over 9This is the most objectively accurate game review ever made in regards to Overwatch. That these so-called ""game journalists"" are your typical shills that can't even finish a Cuphead tutorial and try to pass themselves off as gamers. They are the cancerous casuals that plague the gaming industry and are the major reason why the gaming industry needs another crash. I have played over 9 seasons in competitive only to see a trending pattern that Blizzard has in fact rigged the matchmaking system to give you a lower rating each season and the higher-ups at Blizzard subverted their game into a socialist-utopia where everybody suffers equally except for the very few e-celebs that are placed in a special list to always remain at the top of the ranks regardless of how poorly they play. This could have been a great game but the SJW overlords at Blizzard are busy poisoning everything they touch and it shows that their political ideology is more important than their quality of games. I didn't think it was possible to hate a game company more than EA but they did. For this very reason this is why Overwatch will never become an esport. I even wrote an article solely dedicated to this game on my website. They call it SR as in Skill Rating but in reality it is more like a Socialist Rating. You are forced to carry 80% of your team and if you are part of the top 20%. Blizzard hates nature's law commonly known as the 80/20 rule aka the Pareto Principle. Because naturally 20% of the players will always outperform the rest of the 80% but Blizzard doesn't like that so they forced everyone under their communist rule where everybody suffers equally with their 50/50 winrate. It has now been 3 years and Blizzard downright refuses to release their source code on how the MMR rating is designed. Those of us intelligent enough are fully aware that if Blizzard were to ever release patent this algorithm the average Overwatch player would have no choice but to accept the fact that the matchmaking is 100% rigged against them. The player count is dropping significantly every month as more and more players are catching up to Blizzard's rigging to the point that Blizzard is blatantly mocking their community out in the open. Instead of transparency Blizzard is literally cracking down and censoring their own customers on the forums and on Reddit that dares speak out about the rigged matchmaking system. They straight up delete and ban the original posters without warning as well as the users that receive upvotes that agree with them with guilt through association. Their Darth Vader grip on the forums simply wasn't enough. They literally have a task force dedicated in ""silencing"" aka censoring users for being ""toxic"" aka simply for telling the truth. I have been censored for an entire year for being ""toxic"" simply for disagreeing with their mental illness that is SJW. If you think that I am being hyperbolic Jeff Kaplan openly admitted on his own official YouTube channel on the video called ""Developer Update Popular Community Topics"" on Jan 25"," 2018 that they will track down players committing ""toxic"" behavior outside of Blizzard's platforms. This includes social media",websites and everywhere else on the internet. In their own words they clearly stated: “We now proactively seek out social media sites like YouTube, for example, and look for incidents of very toxic behavior and track down the accounts that are participating in those and action them, oftentimes before anybody’s even reported them or they’ve shown up in any other place. That’s just one example of us being proactive that I think is going to make a big difference over time.” It's even worse than even Twitch is following these self-destructive policies to the point that a class-action lawsuit will eventually take place and put these pro-censorship,illegal activities out into the spotlight much like Google and expose them for what they truly are. A bunch of cowards that use their political ideologies as a means to punish those that simply embrace the truth. Their diminishing playercount is proof that they never take responsibility for anything that the only true toxic players will remain. It now takes 5+ minutes to start a quickplay match and there are fewer experienced players than ever that the double-digit no star players outnumber the experienced players. There is at least 1-2 aimbotters per match and it has gotten so bad that even career gamers that participate in the esports genre have downright stopped playing the game entirely. This just shows that Blizzard is far too corrupt and just as greedy as Activision,Ubisoft and EA to even give a damn about their customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EternalTouch,positive,7,Coming from someone who has played Overwatch for over a year, both for fun and competitively, its hard to judge Overwatch as a game or as a community, as the game itself is an amazing creation, and one of the best team-based games out there today, which has gained a massive following.

That's not to say the community helps its case, and while being one of the funnest games out there right now, the community is swarmed with toxic players, boosting in higher ranks, and griefing: where a player places a lower ranked than what they are placed/skilled yet. i.e. A Master player playing games in Silver. While I do have an extremely fun time playing the game as a whole, the community ruins this game from becoming the perfect game it could be. The Overwatch League, a weekly program from Wednesday to Saturday pits twelve teams against each other, and has definitely re sparked the interest of those who love Overwatch. When it comes down to it, while Overwatch is fun mechanically, the community will leave a sour taste in your mouth, wondering if you're willing to stick through it to simply enjoy the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
