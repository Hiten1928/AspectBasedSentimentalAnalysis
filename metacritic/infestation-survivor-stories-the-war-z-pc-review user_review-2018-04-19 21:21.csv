2,Awful simply awful. the only thing worse than the fact that they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING is the online community. If this is the future of MMOs then I'm ready to get off the train. What do you expect from the developer that brought you the proclaimed worst game of all times Big Riggs. This game is a worthy followup.,0,Trash game is trash. I feel sorry for anyone else that has paid for this game.  I'm doing all I can for a refund.  I have felt robbed since day one.  I have learned from my mistakes.,3,This game begins with a good idea and ends with utter disappointment. I was a big fan but can't stand the constant cheating (Google search it) and the developers inability to do anything about it. For anyone that has purchased the game - go download War Inc. for free and compare. It's the same game with different models. You just paid for a mod of a FREE game.,0,The developers are a scam. The game released as an alpha with no indication it's still an alpha. They're only cashing in on the DayZ hype. They should be sued for false advertisement and much much more. They should be ashamed of themselves.,3,The Game description makes War Z sound like the perfect Zombie game however the Developers lack of fulfilling promises has really gone on too long. With Previous promises of certain features in the "Foundation Release" coming in December only to be met with "1-4 Weeks" until the features listed on Steam may actually be in-game.

With Previous promises of certain features in the "Foundation Release" coming in December only to be met with "1-4 Weeks" until the features listed on Steam may actually be in-game. I could put up with the same models as War Inc and the bugs if only the Developers could meet their deadlines and carry out their promises. Hackers are a problem as well as false bans which have since been corrected. I love the concept - Dislike the execution.,0,I didn't think it was possible for anyone let alone game developers to spew out more lies and empty promises than a politician! The game is apparently in it's "foundation release" and yet looks no more complete than it's initial Alpha release. I would not recommend this game to ANYONE and I actually am disappointed in myself for falling for such a money-grabbing scam,0,While the game had potential the devs and the moderators have abused and suppressed facts and opinions on their forums. They are skirting the line of ethical values and seem to push for a "release title" then to work to finish up the game. This is not a AAA title more like a C title at best. I could go into great detail but this is a game to revisit in a few months. Also the map is aWhile the game had potential the devs and the moderators have abused and suppressed facts and opinions on their forums. They are skirting the line of ethical values and seem to push for a "release title" then to work to finish up the game. This is not a AAA title more like a C title at best. I could go into great detail but this is a game to revisit in a few months. Also the map is a fraction of the size it was going to be and changed the wording many times since Oct 15th alpha. Nothing is on schedule with them and core components are pushed back all the time. The good is if you like a CoD style game with some zombies around play it for the fun of others misery. If you want a survival experience then you will have a long wait ahead of you. Ohh and no friends system set up or away to tell who is a friendly type or a bandit since you have to type to chat and get killed for that. So no VOIP in-game makes it very hard to play with randomly met people.,2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Really really bad. I tried it out while it was in "alpha/beta". I saw great potential in it but as they were getting closer and closer to the release date I basically saw devs that didn't really care about the game but more or less the money they could make from hopping on the DayZ bandwagon. Now that the "foundation build" is out nothing has changed.The map is stillDO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Really really bad. I tried it out while it was in "alpha/beta".

Now that the "foundation build" is out nothing has changed.The map is still buggy the textures are horrible and most importantly almost all of their promises were never met (cars strongholds etc). If the game has been in development for as long as they claim it's been I expected more and I'm basically extremely disappointed. Again this game HAD potential but this game jsut blows.,4,Gameplay is fun but cant say much else. Most unprofessional DEV team I've ever dealt with. Break deadlines regularly called players a **** on official forumsspawn in guns teleport in public servers etc. Check on the game in 6 months IF its still around MAYBE take another look....As for now.. .Stay away.,3,In the games current state it is nothing more than a first person shooter and not a good one at that. No one really hunts the zombies actually the game is more like run in a pack and just kill other players its not really and mmo until the kill on site aspect is addressed.

Hammerpoint is making every attempt to clean out your wallet. They continue to fill the game with broken promises and it seems maybe they cannot deliver what they have actually would be in the game at this point. It really seems that they have spent more time figuring ways to make money than actually fixing the things that are broke in the game e.g glitchy hill drops to your death erratic out of place game sounds bad AI optimized graphics.,3,Does this look like a minority of bad reviews? From the looks of it lots of people are angry. Angry that we were duped by misleading information that the Director stated is ok to do.,3,I like playing the game but their CONSTANT AND CONSISTENT lies have bored me. They have CLEARLY rushed this out no matter what they claim. Has all the potential for a brilliant game if only they spent some of the money from preorders on hiring more developers rather than gold plated suits.

As a developer I understand development hold ups but the problem they face is claiming to have features for "private test groups" that they dont have AT ALL! Its not just delayed features its stuff they have not even started work on! For gods sake the community/clans page does not even refresh you have to LOG OUT to get the new data. From a programming perspective making something like that refresh is the least taxing problem out there just re run the same code that fills it. TLDR;Promising game thats fun to play but constant lies and delays are tiresome.,2,Dreadful. Not being a player of DayZ but aware that my friends and others had enjoyed it I quickly saw this game (The War Z) and made the connection that it was the stand alone DayZ that I had previously heard rumors of. Now I'm willing to accept that I'm at a lot of fault for buying this game on impulse without doing any research and I quickly found out after I had bought the gameDreadful. Not being a player of DayZ but aware that my friends and others had enjoyed it I quickly saw this game (The War Z) and made the connection that it was the stand alone DayZ that I had previously heard rumors of. Now I'm willing to accept that I'm at a lot of fault for buying this game on impulse without doing any research and I quickly found out after I had bought the game but before I had played it that it was not any actual version of DayZ but rather an imitation I was a bit concerned. Still I tried it out with some optimism; it couldn't be terrible but how wrong I was. The game is far from complete. Now this in itself is no real crime; plenty of games are played before they are complete yet they evolve into something much greater over time. The real tragedy here is that it makes no mention of it's Alpha stage before you purchase it. It indeed presents itself as a full and complete game. Now even then that's not to say the game couldn't be fun. Yet while some tend to enjoy it it would seem a good majority does not. (including myself) There's nothing that really orients you towards any sort of goal. Now this is also sometimes a good thing hell it worked for Minecraft but in this case there isn't really too much to actually grasp and adapt to in the game. Focus in the game is not born through the mere playing of it in my experience. Survival quickly becomes a chore rather than a game. On the flip side things look pretty from a distance and zombies in the game do scare the hell out of me so the game isn't totally lacking in potential. Just you know as is don't touch it.,0,I'm not a fan of zero bombing but this is out of principle. This game should not be allowed to be sold at least as it is right now.

Good luck meeting your end-of-2012 launch deadline. I hope the lawsuits don't slow you down.,0,Game has a long list of features none of which are in the game.

This is a company you need to stay far far away from. Anyone interested in this game please be advised anything you see in screenshots or in writing from them is NOT IN THE GAME THEY ARE SELLING.,1,It's hard to explain how bad this game actually is. It is so damn glitch! Also you pay for a Beta game and not a full game!!! Also there are transactions in the game that does not justify the fee you pay for the game it self. Be smart and stay away from this game please!,3,I really want this game to succeed and it does have potential but at this rate the game is barely getting any better and the developers keep pushing back dates for things that they promised beforehand.,3,Big Rigs comes to mind when playing this game. It's unfinished and plagued by bugs exploits and hacks.At first I believed the promises of the developers and decided to just wait it out but Hammerpoint is like that prostitute you just paid and then she admits to you that she has no vagina but too bad she runs off with your money anyways.,3,This game should definatley be in the free-to-play section of steam as it has micro-transactions in it and is in an alpha stage (although said to be the full game in the description with plenty of features that aren't even present in the current build).

Item bought in the marketplace with real cash are not permanent and will be lost immediately upon death - which happens often considering this is a zombie survival game. With all of that in mind I advise you to hold onto your cash  and either wait for the complete game or the standalone Day Z.,1,Not at all what they advertised on steam when i bought it. Not at all what they advertised on their website. Took a peek in the forums and saw all the rage and still bought it. I should have listened. This game may be what it supposed to be in a year but it definitely isn't right now.,0,This is by far one of the very worse games i have ever played and i have been playing video games sense the late 70's it has no objectives or anything resembling a mission all you do is walk around for hours to get anywhere just to die by a horde our get killed by another player when you get to where ya wanna be.So many things are broken about it if you die it can be hours before youThis is by far one of the very worse games i have ever played and i have been playing video games sense the late 70's it has no objectives or anything resembling a mission all you do is walk around for hours to get anywhere just to die by a horde our get killed by another player when you get to where ya wanna be.So many things are broken about it if you die it can be hours before you can respawn unless you pay real money for it and when you do you start without the items you originally started with which is crucial.Warning! don't buy items from market unless your willing to lose them upon death this game is nothing more than a money maker.,0,This game is dreadfully bad! Probably one of the worst games I've played this year. Clearly not finished by any stretch of imagination. Not to mention the Dev's bad business practice and their immature anti-consumer behaviour. This game will get zero points from me!,0,This is a buggy uninspired mess which looks like it was made in 1996 and runs about as well as if it had. The developers were caught out selling it as a complete and full featured game and even when it is clearly an alpha at best.

That is how much they respect you the Consumer.,0,The idea of the game is good. But overall With the current developers this game is doomed. They do nothing but create more ways for them to make money. They have a HUGE hacking problem and they fail to address us about it.  Every time ANY criticizes them they ban their account.

To all who have bought into this stop playing..,3,I bought this game a few days ago with the understanding that it is primarily a zombie survival MMO with pvp elements. This could not be further from the truth. This game is a fragfest free-for-all where the zombies pose a small threat in comparison to the large amount of "bandits" who play the game primarily to ruin other players' experience. Almost none of the promised features have beenI bought this game a few days ago with the understanding that it is primarily a zombie survival MMO with pvp elements. This could not be further from the truth. This game is a fragfest free-for-all where the zombies pose a small threat in comparison to the large amount of "bandits" who play the game primarily to ruin other players' experience. Almost none of the promised features have been implemented including a skill system or a reputation system to curb the prevalent kill-on-sight mentality plus the developers' promise that the game will not be play-to-win has been broken many times over by adding ammunition food beverages and many other items which provide an enormous advantage to people who spend real money on these micro-transactions. The patch today increased the wait time for revive after death from one hour to four hours while conveniently adding an option to pay real money to revive immediately. This is so shady... I had high hopes for this game and honestly the time I have spent playing when I wasn't being ganked (by would-be sociopaths who could care less about zombies when there are people to kill) has been enjoyable. I love the scavenging aspect. Getting chased by zombies is truly terrifying. The night time is very very creepy. There is so much potential but the devs seem to be ignoring the most urgent problems and even working against fixing them at times while releasing patches that are underwhelming to say the least. Overall I would counsel any potential buyer to wait until some of the balancing features are added before spending the money. I am one of many who is seeking a full refund and I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same disappointment I and many others have gone through. One last thought: Entire clans (guilds) are leaving this game in response to today's patch. This should communicate something of the seriousness of the problem this game and its crew are facing if major changes are not make soon. Buyer be warned.,0,This game is **** The developers are **** I bought a Pioneer key (U$S29.99) on Oct 16th been playing a while so I know a bit about this "game".

The so called anti-cheat is a LIE. They say the ban cheaters that´s a lie they just ban random people so they can buy their piece of **** "game" again. Only thing positive I have to say is that luckily after a fight of 2 weeks with "game support" and my credit card costumer support I got the full refund. DO NOT BUY THIS. THIS GAME IS A SCAM! Ask the former War Inc community these guys are the same devolpers they abandoned that game to make this cash-grab of a game.,4,Would love this game if it was handled in a totally different manner. Every move by the Devs have put a quick buck over the long term success of this game. Missed deadlines and early release of a build that has not been improved much since closed alpha. Currently this game is not something I would recommend to my friends and that is a shame since it could easily be the game of my dreams.Would love this game if it was handled in a totally different manner.

Many features listed on Steam are completely missing. The price was reduced to less than $15 in order to squeeze as much money from the game before it dies. I repeat: do not purchase this game you will not get what you think you are getting. The game is also pay to play and it has an free to play store to milk for even more money.

I'm especially frustrated because the game has potential but this is the worse company so far I've seen with borderline illegal commercial practices. I'm so pissed at them since I've met some great people in the game but I don't trust them so I have to speak against them until they change their practices.,1,Pre-ordered the game early October and was in since the first few hours on the 15th.

There is essentially no game features implemented as of yet and even the animations and environments which they all borrowed from the free to play game they based the game off.  If you've played War Inc. think of having a bunch of nearly harmless npcs running around and a few weapon reskins.  The overwhelming lack of professionalism from the developers is incredible as you can easily find with a quick search.  Misleading is the best word you can use for their sporadic communication.  This game will end up free to play if it ever does make it to an actual 'Release' by any proper standards.  Do not buy this game.  You will regret it as I do.,2,After giving this game the benefit of the doubt after accepting and being aware of the fact that it is Alpha/beta test and that I've only pre-ordered the game whilst being "allowed to test"..

Sergey Titov you and your community/forum moderators are slowly no quickly destroying destroying this game by getting rid of anyone who posts suggestions that may be negative towards your game. I gave the game 2 out of 10 because it has potential to not derail itself but land back firmly on its tracks. Though with all these shambles you keep making I believe you may have no idea how to fix this. In my opinion this is a huge shame as I enjoyed the promises you gave us but if I am truly honest I have lost all faith that you will deliver on half of them let alone all. P.S this is coming from someone who wasn't that impressed by Day Z. Before anyone claims I am a Day Z fan boy.,0,This game is a poorly done imitation of other Zombie survival games. It lacks originality and direction and gives the appearance of being out for a fast buck. I am surprised that steam would even offer a game like this,1,One of the biggest jokes in gaming this century. Complete and obvious lies from the developers on a regular basis. This is rumor or opinion it's fact. And I don't mean simple errors in patch contents or anything they have bare face lied on a number of occasions. The game itself could have some potential if it wasn't for the complete idiocy of the developers and moderators.,0,Wow..I prefer to comment on the games that I actually love and I'm usually on the defending side when it comes to flame wars but I HAVE to criticize this game because this kind of behavior is just unacceptable. The game has absolutely nothing that improves upon DayZ which this game is copied from. If this game took the elements from DayZ and made it better I'd call it a good game.

The game has absolutely nothing that improves upon DayZ which this game is copied from. If this game took the elements from DayZ and made it better I'd call it a good game. If it was exactly the same a rip-off. Now I don't know how to call it if it actually took most of the elements from DayZ and made it worse added a pay-to-win micro-transaction items that get destroyed upon death. Yes there's a pay-to-win in-game shop and yes you lose the purchased items if your character dies. This is terrible for both the ones that buy the items and those who don't while devs take the money. The graphic's very bad aside from some of the skies yet poorly optimized. Terrible sound effects aside from gun sounds. The UI is meh and the FoV is so limited. Gameplay is downright boring and the map is too small and poorly designed. The game is pretty much in early-Alpha stage yet they sell the game as if it's finished and even advertise the features that aren't even in the game. This is unacceptable! I've always hated those enraged 0 rating votes but I'd actually give this game minus score if there was one. I don't care if you get enough enjoyment out of this for $14. Don't support this kind of behavior!,1,Absolutely sickening. I had the displeasure of getting a guest pass a week or two ago to try this title and within 10 minutes I had enough.

Hammerpoint Studio lead Sergey Titov is notorious for helping design some of the worst games ever received (Big Rigs: Over the Road) and War Z is no exception. All this company and him want is money and they are trying to cash in on the success of Day Z. Visuals are dreadful and the optimization rivals such polished titles as GTA IV for PC. Sound is terrible. Gameplay is 100% completely identical to Day Z however it's done MUCH worse (and keep in mind Day Z is in ALPHA). To also try and make more money they added in a cash shop which most people know DOES NOT BELONG IN A GAME LIKE THIS. The company randomly bans people (mostly users with high game time as they think it will make them buy the game again) hesitant to offer refunds (luckily since I never owned the game I never had to go through this) blatantly lies bans people criticizing the game. They are shady and I wouldn't trust them with my money. The company is shady unprofessional (Sergey Titov can barely speak english) and the game is also a rushed unpolished abomination that they are trying to sell now in these stages as they know when any professional reviewer plays this load of turd it will be panned AS IT SHOULD.,2,This game is defined as an MMO. Despite this it is definitely not an MMO. Massively Multiplayer pertains to a persistent world which does not exist in this game. Instead you have servers with "batches" of 50 people you can play with. The texture quality especially the grass is quite awful.

It is impossible to see in grass while proneing at all. The money shop gives players huge advantages for those that use it and really punishes players that dont. The game on STeam also says an 100km world and multiple maps despite the fact that War Z only currently has 1 map and it is not even 100km. The game is very much INCOMPLETE. I could go into horrible detail about how this game has missed the mark. I could understand if this game was an Alpha. However this is supposed to be version 1.0 and version 1.0 is a disaster. Not a good buy dont waste your money.,0,Horrible game. It is ridden with bugs and runs like **** on even great computers. Avoid this game at all costs and just wait for DayZ standalone to come out.,0,Horrible badly designed game. A blatant rip off of DayZ and not even a very good one. Makes you pay for the alhpa and then still has a real money cash shop. Filled with hackers and bugs not worth the money. Check out Totalbiscuits video on it to see just how bad it is.,4,I think they could have a great game here. Just when we start thinking there are some good things going on they make updates and changes that are again for more money to play and win.

Items you buy with real money will be lost if you die. half of the advertised features on the steam store page are not even implemented. it basically looks and plays like an alpha. it is clearly unfinished but they actually charge their alphatesters money.,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        The developers don't know what they are doing with this game and most of the promised features are not in the game yet.They even unban cheaters when they ask for it because their anti-cheat doesn't work properly.,2,OK hammer point has lied to the community and numerous occasion's and ban's way to many innocent people for there so called anti cheat   witch has many flaws if its even real and doing ban's on illegal placed items is absurd.Banning people on forums for them speaking there mind on the game is also absurd.So much for treating the community  good.,3,Well I bought this game some months ago as an alternative to DayZ since my friend could not play it and I will admit it was fun for a great while and i managed to cope with the sporadic changes in everything they felt was needed. (not to mention the dev team is the single absolute worst team i have ever had any form of contact with not to mention incredibly unprofessional) Then cameWell I bought this game some months ago as an alternative to DayZ since my friend could not play it and I will admit it was fun for a great while and i managed to cope with the sporadic changes in everything they felt was needed. (not to mention the dev team is the single absolute worst team i have ever had any form of contact with not to mention incredibly unprofessional) Then came the "release" of the game on Steam naturally it comes with publicity and the general public was not the clingy well known fanbase they possessed at an earlier date so upon receiving criticism the updates got a little more out of hand. Which cause the almost constant neglect of their patrons to become quite a problem and would mask completely out of the blue updates with that the community asked. Then the consistent micro-managing came along as if the marketplace wasn't enough of a foreign element they quadrupled  the spawn time simply to make another quick buck (mind you hacking cheating and common game breaking glitches have been in since the release) so they wait until the last minute when they are cornered by unfunded review makers to changed what the community has been asking for the entire lifespan of this game now. And if this list and many more things were not ruining the game already They have LOWERED the standard price of the game $10 and RAISED the reward of paying $25 for people after the "release." If it were not for the fact I actually have a decent account going for some months now I wouldn't bother with this release at all. Save your money for something different.,2,The War Z is DayZ with better graphics. The War Z has many features that rip off from Dayz. As stated in earlier reviews it has many bugs/glitches. If you are willing to spend the extra $10 on ArmA 2 I would favor that over buying this game. Not only does ArmA 2 have mods like Day Z it has mods like Wasteland Mod. You are getting a much better value with buying ArmA 2 over The War Z.,2,this game is a lie it is a pay to play game that wouldn't even serve the people who payed with the kinds of features this game would need to pull some enjoyment out of it. Do not buy this game.

Do not buy this game. The world is huge yes but it is mostly empty uninteresting space that you will have to tediously traverse. there is one map there are supposed to be missions created by the players but i haven't seen anyone use this because the majority of your time and energy spent in this game will be spent avoiding other players because the game is balanced so that it is advantageous to spawn kill noobs as they leave the base and there are no protections for new players as they first venture out of the safe zone. this game is poorly balanced poorly designed does not include most of the features it says it will include and would be pay to win if you could win ever. Oh and did i mention that even off of hardcore mode you lose all of your items when you die and have to wait an hour to respawn. if that doesn't dissuade you then you and this game deserve each other. i promise you wouldn't enjoy it anyways.,5,This game has a TON of potential. And when you find a game without hackers and play with a friend you can have a lot of fun. However right now the Devs (through unprofessionalism) and hackers are destroying the game.

Random bans for no reason. Straight up lying about game features (all screen shots on the website are fake and do not represent the game at all). Fact is this game could be really great. But the devs need to start acting like honest professionals and not snake oil salesmen with a bad attitude. And they need to fix the biggest problems with the game namely the BS nickel and dime transactions and the hackers.,6,Great idea for a game. You take the zombie survival of the Arma II mod: DayZ and you turn it into an MMO where you can fight other players and scavenge for loot.

Many players argue that it is only in beta but the developers fail to give out enough testing. Instead they test the gameplay themselves without using feedback from the community. Great idea and concept but poor execution. I would buy this game while it's cheap because of its potential.,5,I gave a 5 because of the potential I see in the game. I play the game frequently run my own guild of 160+ members was even a moderator for the game's forums for a time and have been a supporter since the forums first opened (registered 22nd on the forums).

Community relations (or lack thereof)... I don't blame Hammerpoint as a whole because there are some good people working for that company. But there have been some major errors made by some major people in that company and it's destroying the community and Hammerpoint's reputation. Hammerpoint needs to act more professional. Insulting members of the community constantly putting out deadlines for various features that they miss showcasing features in the game like they are there but are not etc. There have definitely been times they (mostly just Sergey) have blatantly mislead or misdirected the community about a plethora of things and it destroys the trust between consumer and developer. To be perfectly blunt Sergey needs to keep his mouth shut. Stop using "english is his second language" as an excuse. He has openly insulted players thrown out multiple blatant lies and because of his horrible English makes the company look amateurish. His arrogance will be the company's downfall. Let other's like Tyler (JonnyTruant) or Patrick (Kewk) do the talking and handle the PR. Every time Sergey opens his mouth a disaster happens. The game... It was originally (and still is) showcased as a zombie apocalypse survival MMO. It's not. It's a FPS game set on a wide open map where you collect guns and other supplies in the field. There is no survival aspect to this game and zombies are not a threat (they did add more zombies recently to the game which helped but it's still not close to where it should be). Basically PvE doesn't exist it's 99% about the PvP. So for people buying this game because they think it'll be about surviving the harsh realities of a zombie apocalypse wait to buy it. It's not there yet. We still need probably double the amount of zombies we currently have we need zombie infection we need harder PvE gameplay. We need injuries hunting making fires fighting off sickness etc. MAKE IT ABOUT TRUE SURVIVAL. Right now I have 50 guns dozens of armors 100s of food/water/bandages etc... I'm not surviving I'm thriving. And this is only after 18 days of looting since the last wipe. Core features like skill trees driving cars harder PvE content SERVER RENTALS (which have gotten pushed back probably 3-4 times now) player-generated missions expanded safe zones do not exist but the website advertises it like they do. It's misleading and ruins the credibility of the company. DO NOT ADVERTISE FEATURES IN THE GAME THAT DO NOT (YET) EXIST. I still play the game because I have an amazing guild and I enjoy parts of the game but it has a very long way to go.,7,This game has great potential but has its glitches company issues etc.  If Hammer Point sorted out its need for money and took out most of the gold coin transactions it would be a great game. They also need to stop saying things will be done soon when there not and need a straight time period of a patch.,10,After the recent changes I have now changed my rating to a 10. Let's hope they keep making community changes. The reverting of the 4 hour lockout period has changed my gameplay to more positive in contrary to the previous. Now onto private servers!,8,I've had War Z (Legend Package) since the very beginning and since then I've easily put over 100-hours into it. It's by no means a finished product but despite that it's still a game that gives me and my friends a lot of satisfaction. At its best The War Z gives a real sense of tension and some adrenalin fuelled fire-fights something that after 25 years of gaming (I'm 35) I struggle toI've had War Z (Legend Package) since the very beginning and since then I've easily put over 100-hours into it.

At its best The War Z gives a real sense of tension and some adrenalin fuelled fire-fights something that after 25 years of gaming (I'm 35) I struggle to find. There is a tonne of negativity surrounding this game which for the most part is unfair. I would urge everyone to ignore all that and look for honest and unbiased appraisals of the game before deciding to buy or not. That said there is still a lot to be done to get this game to where it should be and I'm hoping the development team can ride the current storm and achieve their goals. I have to judge this game on the amount of time it's kept me playing and all I can say is that it's the best £ I've spent on a game in a long time (and I spend _a lot_ of £ on games). For me the key features that they need to be adding are all around the dynamics of the game: i.e. different types of zombies e.g. specials with different behaviour and attack patterns wild-life (for food) more reasons to team-up with other players vehicles (on the next and larger map) proximity voice chat radio chat dynamic weather more buildings and outposts to explore on the map etc. In addition there are balancing issues that need addressing such as the 'low gfx' settings that give an unfair advantage to those running them. For the record I'm a big Day Z fan and I'm looking forward to the Standalone it will be interesting to see which one I ultimately invest the most amount of time in. At the moment I'm thinking it will be War Z.,8,A much better game then its reputation. Dont belive all the scam lies about this game. Have had some of my more intense ingame moments in this game. Its a thrill.,8,I loved the game before the 12/14/2012 patch.pvp is really the only fun thing about this game. zombies are way too easy to kill and they're just annoying to deal with.pvp and looting other players corpses is a lot of fun to me.you get an adrenaline rush after player kills because others can watch you in third person mode and wait for you to run by then kill you.

Overall the game plays smoothly and fills a action/arcade/survival niche of the Zombie Game department.  It doesn't take itself as serious as DayZ does but is not a "Rail" shooter like the Left 4 Dead series is.

Every time I log in I get a new chance to comment on how I feel the game should be improved thanks to voluntary surveys.  Its not a finished game by any means but its getting a lot of things right if you can get past all the hate mongering.,8,Don't buy into all the nerd-rage it's great value at $13.50 and a heap more fun than Day Z Mod especially played with friends. Will be interesting to compare it to Day Z Standalone.,9,Game is great and a lot of fun a lot of people are complaining about stuff not being in the game but the devs are working hard on following there timeline they put on the forums. The game is still under development so just play and have fun.,8,I normally don't write reviews but after reading some of those reviews I had to put in my two cents. First notice that all those negative comments are saying "Day Z is better!"  That may be true but this is not day z and you shouldn't hate it because some game similar to it is better.  Rate games on how good it is not how good its competition is.Graphically it is not spectacular.I normally don't write reviews but after reading some of those reviews I had to put in my two cents. First notice that all those negative comments are saying "Day Z is better!"  That may be true but this is not day z and you shouldn't hate it because some game similar to it is better.  Rate games on how good it is not how good its competition is. Graphically it is not spectacular.  It looks like it should be made 5 years ago graphics wise.  Its not all bad though.  I see things and can instantly recognize them.  Graphics are not important to me much and so it is not weighted much in my over all rating Game play is fantastic.  It is a zombie survival horror game.  The game play is exactly what you expect.  You start off some some food drink medicine and a low tier weapon.   Than you proceed to scavenge for more of everything.  Save crap in your global inventory and be happy.  Yes they have an item mall but you can only buy what you can find normally you can find currency in game and its not smart to spend real money because the second you die you lose all your gear. Sound is pretty good.  I don't much care for sound in any game but this game its so so.  You do make sound when you walk on other surfaces gun shots are unmistakable (it even makes that ricochet sound when a bullet hits a rock close by you).  There isn't really any music but there is mood setting sounds occasionally.  I guess its what you expect; from a zombie survival horror. Story is non existent.  This is not bad though in fact this is good.  Its what makes this game special.  Its a sandbox type of game similar to Mount and Blade.  You forge your own path and do what you want. Over all I give this game an 8 out of 10.  it is REALLY fun and will play it a lot. (played it 10 hours nonstop on launch day).  However it can improve a lot and according to the developers.  My mid 2013 it will have a lot better about it (they list what they want to add and when they expect to do it). And on top of all of this the game is only $15.  When compared to a normal $60 game this is a great deal!  Go buy it before they do take it out of beta and jump that price up to $60.,10,i love this game i am not going to use the "its still in alpha beta excuse". but this game still has a chance of surviving and i will keep playing it. the only bad part is the hackers but hopefully they really do have a anti-cheat engine lolol  Overall its only 20-30 bucks and you get to be a part of a game that might be a hit...who knows,10,This game is great. I've played it since November 27 and while there are some miscommunications and glitches this game is overall great. It is still in development but has many great features.

I hardly ever run into hostile players and nothing of any hackers that have been reported. I've managed to get guns several times as well as rare armor and items. As an overal game I give it an 8/10 due to the fact it has some features missing and the developers are sometimes distant on information.,10,The War Z is a lot of fun. I'd give it two thumbs up. One of the best things I love about this game is the death system. In most MMO's death is simply a minor inconvenience -- you die you re-spawn at the alter with all of your gear and maybe suffer some repair costs.

No other game gets my heart pounding and my palms sweaty like The War Z. When you have a backpack full of loot and you hear the sound of footsteps from another player or gun shots nearby..... Oh man it's game on!,10,The WarZ is still developing and i think it got great potential i like the sandboxy aspect of the game atm. The biggest problem being the hackers and the really hard start for new players. Lots of things need to be fixed but im pretty sure the evolution will come quickly.,0,Needs PVE and of. Others are okay with the whole PVP thing but in the end it is unplayable because of people killing you... ALL THE TIME! The developers are con artists it's boring and is pay to win.

The developers were shady banning people who demanded for a refund blackmailing them and treating them like dirt. They made all these high and mighty claims to be in development before DayZ was but have no evidence to support this. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for creating this disgrace to the video game industry. They should apologies for this sad  state of a game but they wont because they have already gotten what they wanted some quick cash from the hard working gamers. To the people who support this game you are sadly misled you should not support these developers and defend them you call us bad or kids because we expect good fun games in this day in age. We should be rallying to remove this joke of a game from the steam store so no more have to buy this broken boring and just junk game. Infestation: Survivor Stories (aka) WarZ should be used as an example for developers as to what not to do.,0,This game is absolutely horrendous. The game is absolutely full of hackers who can purchase stolen or sold accounts for less than 2$ so they will never go away. I strongly advise anyone to stay away from this game.

While running from one area of the map to another with my friend I was suddenly instant killed by the server and banned no warning or anything. After contacting Hammerpoint they said I had been banned for hacking (the audacity!) refused to provide any specifics or proof of such a claim and informed me that my account would remain as such permanently. After much coercion from my friend to buy the game again so we could continue playing together I caved in and started all over again for the $15 price. Considering my friends all had better skills and equipment at this point I spent quite a bit of time over a few days farming zombies for the meager amount of exp you get. While clearing the airport of zombies after playing for practically all day I was suddenly instant kill and banned AGAIN! Once again Hammerpoint wanted me to re-buy the game. At this point of course it's obvious that this game is nothing more than a marketing scam and a poorly implemented one at that. Suffice to say after such a bad experience for such a piss-poor game hell will freeze over at least twice before I would spend one minute playing this sorry excuse for a game again.,0,Just do to all the stupid positive reviews...

The game is wrought with so many hackers and bugs it's a vicious cycle trying to spawn gather (server-hop if threatened) run to safe zone. What happened to no 'pay-to-win' microtransactions? Buying rare backpacks and ammo in the store certainly seems like a big help in 'winning'. I honestly can't even waste any more time on going into further details about why this game is so horrible. If I can get one person considering this game to not buy it I've done my job.

The saddest part about it all is that you pay $14.99 for a game that stresses it includes features such as strongholds anti cheat and many other non-existent features.  The steam review is intentionally vague so that they don't need to take responsibility for telling you a specific value a month ago they stressed it was "100 km of land" when in truth it's 100 km including the empty skybox.  The best part is if you look at the help they tell you it's not a Pay 4 Win game but the weapons are so rare (some don't even spawn!) that it seems it is a Pay 4 Win.  They nickle and dime you what I would expect from a pay once then play for life game is that there is no in-game real-money shop.  Though the game has good features it's the developers that I really dislike.  They give you their word then the day comes and they say "Sorry there was a delay!" then you wait and the same thing is said.   The second worst thing in this game is that they promised you some limited item for buying the alpha version but they know that hackers can just hack the random items in and then claim they're legit alpha'ers plus they promised the alpha price was cheaper than the beta or gamma price but is 25 less than 14.99?  I don't think so...  Plus they abuse the new players and ban those that criticize their game in a way that forces them to either buy the game again or quit.  My thought for all you people out there quit.  The third thing is that they make an in-game real-money shop but hmm I wonder if they put the time and effort they did into the game that they did into the store it would be even better than DayZ!   I give them credit for the base game engine and I give them a thumbs-up for the survival based gameplay but it's buggy you can jump off of a car [in which the car is incredibly off scale or you are] and take no damage but you can crawl down a small hill and take 3/5 of you're health as damage?  Plus the doorways are a bit off scale and the developers in game are jerks some even encourage hacking.  If you put this all together the game would be horrible if it got better and with a good company governing over it it would become an actual MMO and way more enjoyable for the players.  I like the game just not the creators.,0,Okay okay first of all have i ever told you about the definition of insanity. its repeating something over and over and over again expecting something to change. really guys stop the lies and using images from walking dead terms of service from League Of Legends grow some balls,0,Este juego es un fraude no da nada de lo que pide. aunque este en fase beta eso no tiene que significar que pueda tener tantos bugs. por ejemplo. hace unos dias me conecte felizmente para jugar en un servidor con pocas personas porque el juego este esta lleno hasta arriba de hackers y cuando menos personas en un server mejor. bueno pues me meti en el server y sopresa! de golpe morí y meEste juego es un fraude no da nada de lo que pide. aunque este en fase beta eso no tiene que significar que pueda tener tantos bugs. por ejemplo. hace unos dias me conecte felizmente para jugar en un servidor con pocas personas porque el juego este esta lleno hasta arriba de hackers y cuando menos personas en un server mejor. bueno pues me meti en el server y sopresa! de golpe morí y me creia que eran los hackers pero no. me mato una cosa llamada fairfight total que me desconecte y me meti con otro personaje y me tiro del juego cuando volvi a entrar poni que estaba baneado permanentemente.

Having an email telling me to change P/W their  ass launcher wouldn't let me in the game to do it or do it via the launcher as it was out dated but wouldn't update because they shut everything down due to being hacked  for weeks I couldn't do it on the site and the whole thing was a joke. The game is riddle with hackers the players are for the most part childish and idiotic and there isn't a single good thing to say about this abomination for a game. Graphics  2 (outdated rubbish and bland)sound  1 (repetitive cheesy and stupid)gameplay  0 (non-existent run around for ages to get 1 shot by a camping sniper gun play is like a 15 year old FPS)longevity  0 (I tried for a week to like it but after 5 minutes I felt ripped off)Developers  MINUS 10 (The worst possible developers of all time. They treat the game like a joke the customers like a joke and I'm sure what they are doing is borderline illegal) There's a reason this game scores so low.

Seriously look it up this travesty bans based on stats rather than detections. No I am not kidding. There is a reason BF3 admins stopped using that failure of an "anti cheat"The game just looks terrible too. At first glance it's not too bad but then you look at the textures at a reasonable distance and you want to puke. I actually saw 2D props in this game. Yes 2D props.The animations are terrible I've seen better ones in player made mods from older games.Loot is bad and nowhere to be found zombies glitch out and teleport to you thanks to the game's NUMEROUS glitches. Speaking of zombies if you were looking to play this because the zombies are slower and according to logic more realistic because of it than DayZ don't even bother. There are SPRINTING zombies in this game and the last patch made it so that now there is even more.There are hackers everywhere. Almost every single survivor I came across had some kind of ESP or aimbot.To top it all off this monstrous pile of excrement has the audacity to be PAY TO WIN. There is a marketplace and even though you can not buy guns you can buy ammo which is VERY VERY hard to find normally as well as attachments which can NOT be found in-game and armor which also can NOT be found in-game.Support is terrible I would even say non-existent. Good luck if you have any issues you are better off asking the players. Here is my experience playing the game:Day 1: look around get a feel for the game and look for stuff to pick up. Not much is found but scant supplies but at this point I thought it was just bad luck or a bad zone. Died about 3 times to zombies because I was still learning and once to a player who seemed to know where I was at all times.Day 2: I have looked online for spawn locations for zombies and items and tactics. I die twice to players after finding 3 guns all pistols. One might have been legitimate but the other was clearly aimbotting.Day 3: I make a route of the best possible paths to get "good" loot. After coming and going out of these very dangerous areas I have come across 4 pistols and finally one assault rifle. I did not die that day because I was going into VERY low pop servers. Also found good backpacks.Day 4: Continuing my loot route I keep to my low pop servers tactic. This proved to be for naught as I get killed by a player over 300 meters away with an assault rifle in 2 shots. The "max range" for assault rifles is 85 meters. After losing all this stuff I continue to try and loot finding two assault rifles and a few pistols after a long time of looting the same "high quality areas" and server hopping often.Day 5: Looting continues I die halfway through. I had accidentally pulled a lot of zombies but managed to outrun them putting at least 20 meters between me and the one leading the pack with a sliver of health left but it glitches and teleports to me and kills me instantly. Infuriated I continue to try and play until I get killed by yet another player despite having nothing on me. At this point I ragequit for the day.Day 6: Looting again.. this time I actually find a sniper rifle for the first time in an item box. Feeling good I now try and remain on the higher ground whenever I am out looting so as to spot and snipe players before they get close. Plan did not work out was killed by a player aimbotting with an assault rifle once again.Day 7: No players no glitches decent loot. Or at least what can be called "decent" in this game with such crappy loot. Everything's fine. I am walking towards the city when I see chat light up with bans. No big deal I've seen this before but it is annoying to see on the chatbar. I comment in global saying that it's annoying to see that every day and all of a sudden my character dies. I rage and figured I had been killed by a sniper or something as I was sure no player or zombie was near me at all. I try to log back in the game and guess what? Account permanently banned. Excuse me? I am permanently banned? Yet I have come across all these hackers?? Did I mention this was AFTER purchasing GC?! Apparently something I did triggered fairfight (FAILFIGHT)'s statistics system and got me banned. Maybe I headshot too many zombies and it thought I was aimbotting because of it who knows. Either that or an admin saw me commenting about how annoying the ban messages were on the chat and thought I too should have a taste. This is literally the worst game I have ever played in my entire life and I doubt I will ever play something worse ever again. Everything that can be wrong about a game infestation has it.All the badmouthing this game has received is in reality ten times worse than that.

ANYONE who purchased the game and not activating their serial key or log in for around 2 months are considered as inactive and are banned for no reason. Many people filed support and complaints and the lucky ones would get their account re-activated AFTER 2 months of "investigation". The game developers are shady and unprofessional. They even delete forum posts regarding this matter (as well as many others) just to hide the problems.,0,Worst game ever  The developers want to pull the money out of the pockets of the players.THE GAME IS NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18!HIGH ADDICTION FACTOR  ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE!Do not play it  Sometime you regret having spent money for the game .Here's a few things that come to mind spontaneously:- It flies regularly out of the game  "Punkbuster" kicks eitherWorst game ever  The developers want to pull the money out of the pockets of the players.THE GAME IS NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18!HIGH ADDICTION FACTOR  ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE!Do not play it  Sometime you regret having spent money for the game . Here's a few things that come to mind spontaneously: - It flies regularly out of the game  "Punkbuster" kicks either match or you get errors. If you fly out of the game you will still be some time ingame  Anyone can kill you in this period  zombies or players  .- Graphics bugs can be found anywhere  Missing or incorrect textures. Flying objects or sunk in the ground.- At many specific points you just get lag. Lags when Chem lights or burning torches lying around .- Lag and bugs with zombies. Zombies hit from a distance. Zombies stuck in objects. Zombies teleport around.- Wait for 10 seconds until you can leave the game  mostly you wait even longer. In time  you can not cancel or defend themselves. For me waiting times were up to 1 minute are not uncommon.- Many hackers in the game with Aimbot  ESP Wallhack & Flyhack  Let's tell you anything. There are also hackers veterans server.- Lately there are fewer and fewer servers and fewer players .- GC was prohibited .- You can only buy in-game dollars with GC. Prices in-game store  dollars) were extremely elevated so that the customers need to buy more GC.- New maps have been promised for months and repeatedly postponed .Without private servers you can hardly play quietly  On many players spawn camping with sniper rifles  You can not trust anyone  Private servers are very expensive  about 50 dollars) for 1 month.- Premium Accounts (1650 GC) are not very good. While you get more than twice as much experience but the loot is not only more but better. Quantity rather than quality. But Premiumserver are Public. There are no premium private server. Therefore the risk of dying during looting much higher. You get 900 GC back but only if one logs on once a day. Time is important.- The screenshots in Steam does not always correspond to the truth. A few zombies characters and weapons do not exist in the game.- Little customization of the characters. Some characters do not even have 2 look.- Game content are promised (eg cars) and are now canceled.- Many players were banned for no reason. The manufacturer was no answer. Players had to wait for months until they were able to play again. Some wait longer or forever.- PvE  Here you'll find no PvE  only PvP Look around  there are still dozens of other problems and complaints.,0,just doing my part as a responsible gamer to help further lower the score on this game and show the horribleness of the developers.

It's over priced for such a bad game. It is also a rip off of DayZ the awesome mod for Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead.  Worst game of 2012. One more thing to mention: IT WAS MADE BY THE CREATORS OF BIG RIGS OVER THE ROAD RACING which is a bad thing because the game is the worst game I have ever played in my entire life along with Extreme Paintbrawl.,0,Don't buy this game!

Broke game can't swim extolling money for pay to win items hackers galore banning people regardless of what they were doing and generally horrible business practices...  Stay away from this game and company at all costs.,0,the war z is nothing but an impudently scam. lying about production and releasing a totally bugged and unfinished game which does NOT contain the promised features. they charge money to rent your own server and what? you can not even control your own server! if you want items or weapons on YOUR OWN server you have to PAY for them  on your own server. that is so unbelievable impudent!,0,Do not buy this game cheap copy of Day Z  made to make money. They lied to sell more copies of the game and they are ignoring all criticism by blocking/banning people from the game forums steam community and more. Textures are horrible assets are taken directly from War Inc. and zombie AI is brainless. There are also a lot of hackers in game.,0,The second game in my 25 years of gaming that i ever got a refund on.  Most the positive reviews look fake.  Avoid this like the plague the guy who made it has 3 of the top 10 worst games ever made he lied to everyone and when called out on it he blamed us saying we didnt understand him right we are stupid and uneducated.Let this just be a lesson to developers.,0,I'm just having to write this review because I noticed that out the first 5 people I saw that gave this game a 10..for all 5 of them this was their only review.  I've been following the saga of this game in the gaming news and the whole thing just sounded like such a jaw dropping scam I had to register for myself to counterbalance at least one of those fradulent 10's.

I've been following the saga of this game in the gaming news and the whole thing just sounded like such a jaw dropping scam I had to register for myself to counterbalance at least one of those fradulent 10's.  Selling in game items for real money that can then be taken from you by a hacker or spawn camper? Let alone that this game is a blatant ripoff of Day-Z by a terrible developer...yeah...that's all I needed to stay a mile away from this game and it's greedy publishers.  Keep in mind also that Steam initially pulled this game over making claims about its game that weren't even true.  Buyer beware.,0,Not only is the game a disaster but the company behind it is shady as well. I was lucky and got refund before they started reply to refunds with "asdasd". The name is genius. Makes people think it's standalone DayZ. It is not. It's a shame of a game.,0,Its a non-free game with micro transactions. If it was free i might play it a while (ty steam refund) but it is still a buggy mess with cheats and hacks.,0,Worst game ever which now got hacked to its bones.Enjoy getting your user data being sold across the web. If that doesnt bother you you can always login to get aimbotted to death while enjoying the lack of feature this game has. Truly another marvel of the gaming industry!,0,the game is unplayable there are a loot of cheats and hacks....bad grafics  idiot zombies  the worst game played in my live its a game from a 1$ price and its expensive for 1$!!!dont buy  its a nightmare!,0,Warning: I’m Spanish so don’t expect to see a British in this critic.Well I try lend this game a  5 because if you like it you like it (there isn’t any book of likes and dislikes) but I lend it a ZERO it’s not simply a  of game is a fraud. Why? Well let’s start whit the critic.1: The EULA was a EXACT copy of the league of legends EULA at the bottom of it you could read “WhenWarning: I’m Spanish so don’t expect to see a British in this critic.Well I try lend this game a  5 because if you like it you like it (there isn’t any book of likes and dislikes) but I lend it a ZERO it’s not simply a  of game is a fraud. Why? Well let’s start whit the critic. 1: The EULA was a EXACT copy of the league of legends EULA at the bottom of it you could read “When press accept you agree whit riot and league of legends terms and conditions” (is not exactly but was something like that) but obviously casual gamers or the 99% don’t read the terms and conditions (I’m include but I usually read the updates changes on games and in some parch at the bottom appeared a “change of the Eula” I fell curiosity and I search in internet and TADA! i found the why of the EULA change)2: The false publicity. On steam you see the game as a finished game whit good graphics pictures “in game” and videos whit excellent animations. You get on the game and the textures sucks a lot the modeling is a crap and the animations aren’t realistic or what we seen on the videos. Graphics aren’t the most important of the games but when you lie to your public is important. And the person as says “is a ALPHA a BETA a unfinished game!”  well steam buyers thought that the game was ended whit updates but ENDED. In the page appears as a ended game so another lie. (And minecraft was on alpha and beta a lot of time but it was a good game anyways Natural selection is not ended is in alpha and is good 2 so is not a excuse)3: Stupid work really it gots 300 bugs and they aren’t trying solve them they still there and they will stay. “but is a indie game made whit a small group of persons” NVM! They should fix that! Is affecting the gameplay so hard and the why they don’t fix them because it’s a game that take them 3 hours of script 1 hour of texturing they buy 4 servers and dead end. They aren’t going fix it and they will add 3 things more so the ppl can keep saying that the game isn’t finished.4: The idea is a copy of another game that can be discussed but if you say no explain me the copy of the title! They took that 2! They didn’t do anything new ho srry the micro-buys but that’s only a pay-to-win strategy and a way to take more money. Take ideas is not bad but do the same as other did it is.5: Gameplay lies yes more lies. Hardcore appears as a ended option. But you go in the game and is a feature as is not ended so is so hard add that on steam? Is so easy: “To end: Hardcore”  and another big one: MMO war z is a MMO. Massive multiplayer online? Really? A game whit 50 persons is not massive. Call of duty 64 slots BTF 64 slots (or close) natural 24 slots.  These games aren’t MMO and a game whit 50 is not a MMO and whats the point of that? A group of ppl that love say “I play MMO´s” buying it? I prefer a zombie survival where you fell really alone disesperated where you MUST work in teams for survive the massive enemies (think this: a city whit 3000 ppl on it 10 survive 2990 are zombies that’s the idea you are a a lucky person as why X reason is not a zombie)6: Gameplay. The survival ends after you got this trick: the IA sucks. You go to the city run to the zombies and then run away the zombies stay whit no reason afther 30 meters and they stand there and BOLIA! Free way to loot but be careful! The really survival as you got is the following one: Don’t crush an invisible wall or the dangerous camper player will shoot you whit a sniper and dead end.  Really the PVP is more difficult that the PVE (player vs environment) that happens sometimes in DAYZ (im not a fanboy but I have to compare it for the following reason  but in the stand alone they will try solve it whit the gun deterioration so the camper after X time will need go loot another sniper and that’s a solution. Hammer is not lending any solution to itSo the conclusion is the following one: you like it because you like it good for you but is a fraud. The company want a shower of money selling a product copied of another company and then wash their hands saying: “The game is not ended”. Don’t buy it but if you aren’t a anxiety person and you can wait wait for DAY Z STAND ALONE it will be a good game a awesome. Whit updates and whit less bugs or not bugs because is not a mod is a single game whit they own scripting. But if you want play a multiplayer zombie survival online NOW I recommend the DAY Z mod. But when the stand alone comes out the mod will stop updating I think.,0,The worst games i have ever played... don´t spend your money with this  the controls are horribles the engine is horrible the graphics.... and if you are rich or  a hacker it´s your game if you not you,0,Absolute garbage.  I bought this to tide me over until DayZ standalone and boy do I regret it; I should have done my homework on these developers.  This game is an obvious cash grab.  The developers are full of s!@#.

The community for it is awful and consists almost entirely of griefers. There is no use buying this game because it will just ask for more and more and more if you want to actually play it. This may appeal to those with no sense of accomplishment and a swollen bank account.,0,Worst waste of cash I've ever done hackers everywhere (more than a 40% of players using them) unplayable game it's more a shooter than a survival game.

FAIL they really need to just get sued and games banned from all Sales outlets.,0,This game is for a lack of better words AWFUL. To even call it a "video game" would be an insult to the entire gaming community. I have never seen a game riddled with so many game breaking bugs. It is essentially unplayable.

That's it i'm done with the game. This  ain't even worth for free. DON'Y BUY IT!,0,I purchased this game for $40 when it was still in Alpha i was hopeful it would be a successor to the DayZ Mod for ARMA II which is fantastic. But this game is so terrible i'd rather burn $40 than buy this game again. It may sound harsh but this is possibly no defiantly the worst game on the planet. It only has ONE good thing and that is it is a comfortable and easy uninstall.,0,This is everything that is wrong with gaming.  I don't wish any sort of personal vengeance against the creators but some efforts deserve to fail and this is one of them.  One of the sloppiest things I've ever seen.,0,The game has many bugs the anti cheat system before the arrival of PunkBuster was in my opinion useless and did not solve anything. Was banned by the game just because I played a lot. Would not recommend.,0,Pay cash or get hooked up with a friend. Absolute only 2 ways to have a fair foot in the game. Something they should do is let you start with any kind of weapon or make sneaking around zombies less time consuming especially with the 1 hour death timer.

It's just the same thing with a different name. At this point it's easy to ask if the devs are even trying to make this game happen. It all comes off as a big "buy now regret later" scam where they slop together some quick face to sell the product then ignore anything that only matters after the purchases are made. Kinda like how Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing was made actually. Not surprising that after a decade of being a laughingstock these developers haven't even changed their most basic tactics for game development.,0,This game is so bad I can not even fathom how others can give it a rating over 3/10.

And now everyday I wish Steam would give me a refund because this game is-just-a-piece of God damn...It's just so bad it should get an award of worst game of the century. I honestly believe this won't be exaggerating. I understand this game is still Beta but the quality of this game present is nowhere able to justify how  it is. All in all a bit of exaggerating opinion to help you decide whether or not to get this game or not.A) Burn down a hospital full of pregnant women and new born babies.B) Buy this game. The answer is you should really chose A instead of B. That's just how bad this is.,0,So maybe I've left this review a little late.

That is when the game used to be fun where you couldn't purchase ammunition and the Devs. hadn't rolled in their greedy campaign for the users money. It's one thing to charge people to play your game and then to further charge them through an ingame store because let's be honest the items in the store do not take '20 minutes or so to find in game' because a flashlight Jedi would have emerged from the darkness and struck you down before that. It's a game full of broken promises we were promised drivable vehicles and those who bought in early were falsely led on the pretense that they were to be given their own Stronghold server.. (We're STILL waiting for them). All in all a shoddy attempt to cash in on a popular MOD (Which hasn't taken any money thus far) by changing the character models of their other poor Online-Shooter War Zone Inc.,0,I've never been shocked and appalled with a game purchase before but after my new experience you can count on 'Infestation' to change that.

I was shocked so when I emailed back saying they've lost a customer and I would give 'DeadZ' a try they threatened they would contact steam and tell them to ban my account as 'they caught me cheating' (basically lying).

The developers openly lied on the Steam store. In addition they felt it necessary to have in-game purchases even though the game is already a rip-off. This is the only game on Steam that Valve has ever openly handed out refunds for. Think about that.,0,I bought this game for $3.49. I should have just bought a cheap cigar and put it out in my eye. This game is bad as they say. There is little even for a big zombie enthusiast to enjoy here. the levels are really big with nothing between camp sites but glitchy forests not even wayward zombies. The game is geared towards making you spend real money on gear. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL!,1,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.

In Game Transactions: The biggest mistake War Z makes is the in game store. I found to my dismay that purchasing a weapon and dying from a glitch several minutes later does not mean that when I respawn I'll have that weapon back. Bad move and a bad idea... In all The War Z is a blatant bad game with wasted potential. If some changes were made I could consider a higher rating. But War Z is in it's current state a shadow of what it could have been.,1,Be warned The screenshots on their website are mostly prerenders.You are better off looking up youtube player footage to see what it really is like.Shame that it was so bad it could have been something nice. Multiplayer is fun with friends a lot of these maybe and green reviews are from people mistaking the enjoyment of doing that as a good game.,1,To put it lightly this game is atrocious.

Low-res textures sluggish gameplay not to mention the fact that zombies are near invincible. Another mistake Hammerpoint have made are the in-game micro-transactions I'm talking about the marketplace where you can purchase ammunition forTo put it lightly this game is atrocious. There for those of you with a short attention span there it is. Honestly what didn't go wrong with the game? Low-res textures sluggish gameplay not to mention the fact that zombies are near invincible. Another mistake Hammerpoint have made are the in-game micro-transactions I'm talking about the marketplace where you can purchase ammunition for guns... this is a SURVIVAL horror game why include this option? Steam also failed to notice that this game was only in its beta stages when they released it (I believe this has since been pushed forward to the full game or alpha) I made a definite mistake of purchasing this garbage game. I and many others think that this game is only a cheap rip of the hugely successful Arma 2 mod DayZ which I recommend you play. I'm not here to rant about this game as many people still enjoy the game but in all honesty most people are only playing this game because they want to get their moneys worth. If you have not bought this game... Don't. Simple as. This game is not worth the price on Steam and it was never checked as FALSE ADVERTISING was also used in the selling of this game. I'm mainly advising you not to buy this game but that's not to say I haven't had my fair share of enjoyable moments (even if they were short-lived). All in all this game is a cheap and terrible rip of a hugely successful game and I would advise anyone who is thinking about buying it to not buy it. I went down the War Z road and it's not a very scenic route.,1,It is a shame they allowed this game back on to Steam...let it die already. I could drone on about its numerous flaws or how I'm currently using the BBB to get my money back from them. Good idea for a game hopefully someone else does it right. I will never do business with these people again.,0,By far one of the biggest farces in videogaming history.

The combat is terrible And frankly this game is essentialy the biggest scam ever made to exploit people who actualy like zombie survivals. Did I mention the combat is simply awful?,1,In short the game was rushed in development and it shows. I saw all the bad reviews and thought i would decide for myself so thought i was prepared for the worst turns out i wasnt. The point of this game was to be an accessable version of DayZ but it isnt all that accessable once you are playing you start with no weapon and in a world of the bloof thirsty zombies and equaly bloodIn short the game was rushed in development and it shows.

The point of this game was to be an accessable version of DayZ but it isnt all that accessable once you are playing you start with no weapon and in a world of the bloof thirsty zombies and equaly blood thirsty players this pretty much screws you over from the start and stops you gaining an intrest in the game. this would be forgivable if the game were mmore sick than its modded counterpart but it isnt. The idea behind the game is good and hope it lives on but this game is not good and should never have been released as it is. DONT BUY IT IT JUST ENCORAGES THEM TO MAKE MORE BAD GAMES,0,I purchased this game back before it was released based on the screenshots and what the developers promised to the community. Unfortunately none of the things that were promised to us were ever implemented.

The graphics on the game appear to be out of date the sound effects  are comical and the zombies have that super spidey-sense that allows them to know where you are coming from a mile away. Even after all those downfalls I still tried to play the game and I found a group of people who were actually fun to play with.  Then I decided to buy another copy over steam for my brother.  Within two hours of playing it he was banned from the game and no one can tell him why. So because of the horrible customer support that my brother received and the all around bad game play I had enough and quit playing.  Now I'm out trying to save everyone the hassle of wasting their money and being abused by the developers only in the game to make more money and never help the community.,0,Haters will hate but games will scam aswell.. if they didnt want the bad remarks they shouldnt have lied and said shyt that was totaly untrue just to gain money and player base. but hey people will waste money on crap things and thats why game companys still do this stuff cause they CAN and people will pay for it and there cash shop items in a survival game anyways so yeah.. have fun withHaters will hate but games will scam aswell.. if they didnt want the bad remarks they shouldnt have lied and said shyt that was totaly untrue just to gain money and player base. but hey people will waste money on crap things and thats why game companys still do this stuff cause they CAN and people will pay for it and there cash shop items in a survival game anyways so yeah.. have fun with this game thats not worth the review people are making.,1,Thought this game was going to be interesting but the insult here is the amount of lawsuits and stolen engine pieces they have. THey tried to get by with minimal amount of paying for things and used only 10% of the engines full power... let alone even use the updated version of the engine from version 1.2 to 10.02.34. It's Insulting that they did that.  and stole ideas from another game.,0,This game is probably one of the worst multiplayer games I ever tried ever. It has very little redeeming factors to even consider recommending this to anyone. First the gameplay is very subpar the developers seemed very lazy when making it glitches and hackers run wild and the zombies are surprisingly more brain dead then a can of sardines. The promises the devs make never get fulfilledThis game is probably one of the worst multiplayer games I ever tried ever. It has very little redeeming factors to even consider recommending this to anyone. First the gameplay is very subpar the developers seemed very lazy when making it glitches and hackers run wild and the zombies are surprisingly more brain dead then a can of sardines. The promises the devs make never get fulfilled or stretch the little they actually do to make it look like they did something. and  It's a game that's trying to cash in on the WarZ hype and it has had so many complaints it's a wonder that people are still playing and paying. There is a cash shop in the game and you need to pay real money after buying the game to get ahead of the game easily...so much for the survival aspect if you can just pay through it. The service was terrible I was banned about 8 hours in because of "hacking" which is a flat out WTH moment since I wasn't customer support was less than helpful and said if I wanted to play again I would have to buy it again.  Everything screams shady when there is a metascore this low because this game is just one thing. It's a money grab! Save it for something with a better reputation and a development team that really cares for the players.,1,This game is a joke. Not only is it plagued with bugs and glitcheshackers and cheaters Micro-transactions on a game payed for.But whats worst is that this game promised so much that it never delivered to teh point it's been removed from steam and re-namedIts horrid,0,This is the worst Game I ever bought and played.It's not worth ANY MONEY AT ALL.Many BugsNearly no promised features found its way into the Gameeven after a one year period.Worst Game and worst Publisher i ever encountered.,0,this game had potential... but then they  on it with bad game play glitches and lies in the trailers... this game is by no stretch of the imagination worth it avoid this game at all costs,3,i bought this on Steam thinking this looked like a good game and it was pretty fun    at least for the first few minutes. You can go in lots more buildings (unlike DayZ) and you can jump over things easier as well as climb on cars (which actually works to prevent death by zombie) and that is about all of the positives.

You can go in lots more buildings (unlike DayZ) and you can jump over things easier as well as climb on cars (which actually works to prevent death by zombie) and that is about all of the positives. The graphics are pretty bad you can get hurt from even the smallest fall spawn campers and glitchers are too common there is no quest system or clan system you have to wait a long time to respawn from death and you lose all of your stuff so there is no reason why you should not just make a new character and get all new stuff too and purchasing stuff at the store by doing things in game takes ridiculously long(unless you use lots of real money) plus when you die you lose all the stuff you just bought with real money. It had potential to be a good game but it still feels unpolished and should be considered either a very terrible final product or still in Alpha stage. It is a shame that Steam decides to treat it as a finished product when it should be call Alpha still. If you want to play a open world zombie survival game then go play the DayZ mod for Arma 2 or wait for State of Decay to come out.,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        This game is terribleI have NEVER seen such bad balance in a game. Brutal player killing bugs missing features and expensive micropayments are the true drawbacks of the impending zombie apocalypse.,0,Did they really think changing the name from The War Z to Infestation: Survivor Stories is going to trick gamers into buying it? Another disgusting display from the developers here.,0,I played this game with an open mind expecting Day Z with better visuals animations etc and with less bugs.

The in game mini transaction system take all the challenge out of an already payed for game and leave players who are unwilling to spend there hard earned cash on ammo and hats at a disadvantage. I can only declare this game to be absolute garbage and it fully deserved it's appalling meta-score. To top it all off the devs decided that it would be an excellent idea to change the name and temporarily remove it from steam adding yet another reason as to why you should ignore this game developer until they pull there hypothetical head out of there arse.,1,This game falls short on everything and did not say on Steam about it changing it's name on the store page which tells a false advertisement which they did when they first came out and they denied to refund me for their false advertisements. I am angered at myself and this is honestly the only game I gave a bad review or a score of 1!

The game is full of bugs horrid visuals decent audio terrible animations and very very slow game play. You will have to sneak most of your time even if a zombie is 200 feet away from you and he will spot you which will lead to other zombies chasing you if you try to run so either way you are going to die. The game makes it where you can only spawn 5 characters and you have to wait an hour for the character you played as dies to play him again.For a sub titles that are way better than this and you still want to get your zombie fix I highly recommend this game as I highly enjoyed it.Arma 2 Combined Operations  DayZ mod (DayZ is a free mod and the same concept of this game I am reviewing and I would rate that mod a 8 out of 10),3,Infestation: Survivor Stories is a terrible game on paper.

So some weeks later they announced a new patch that they now gave us a chance to turn off shadows. We thought we could play again. But we were disappointed again.The only settings before were High/Ultra they only changed the labels not the real effect.

I started playing this game in it's Beta stage and it had a lot of bugs then but once the game was released it was an entirely different game and I mean for the worse. First off the game had nothing to stop cheaters from using aimbot esp and all of that stuff so you primarily only played in games with a couple of people or empty so you could at least enjoy the game without being killed by a cheater. This only got worse over time and I quit about the time they implemented that fairplay because the developer kept on with lies. The servers were supposed to be priced reasonable or at least that's what he said something around $20 a month but when they actually allowed you to rent servers it was $60+ a month and even more for a password protected server. So what people started doing is renting slots out and you paid them with the in-game stuff or the currency that you could shop with(I don't remember what it's called). That was the only way to actually play a decent game without having to worry about cheaters. Then what killed the game the most is the developer kept messing with the loot spawns zombie spawns and all of that and it just got tiring. You would of honestly never expected the game to be such crap after looking so promising. I wouldn't give this game to somebody for free. If you want a zombie game play Day Z or wait for H1Z1(though it keeps getting pushed back).,0,I have been waiting to give a review since I naively paid for this so called game when it came out.

It places you in an unattractive glitchy world full of terrible zombie animations ugly textures and unused space. The game runs awful and their coders have no clue what they’re doing. They are constantly changing the game in bad ways. Loot has never been stable. It’s either out of control and you’re being flooded with finding chemlights at every spawn or you’re finding nothing. Hammerpoint is constantly finding ways to get their players to spend money. You can buy items in the marketplace buy your own private server to avoid dying against players and buy premium which allows you to only have a hope at finding something of better value at a spawn point. The lead guy behind the title released a forum post saying that if people didn’t buy from the marketplace the game would eventually have to go offline. They even included a hotkey that opens the shop in-game for you to buy items and have them instantly (which has now been removed with the latest patch). If you’re looking for a “survival” game this isn’t it. Infestation: Survivor Sandwiches (Kappa) is nothing but a money grab and is ran by a shady company that has no interest in making a quality title but instead snagging as much money as they can while they kill off the game. I feel like I’m being generous with this again but my score is definitely changing. Please if you’re looking for a survival game avoid this piece of trash at all costs.,6,Do not purchase this game.its very bad full of hackersbugs and disconnect problemsbad supportJust look at the İnfestation forums to see the problems,3,AWFUL GAME.

The price of the game is alright and micro transactions are somewhat understandable but the content is not as of yet is not near "Fun" as "Boring" is.It still holds promise but for now it's to most peoples Index in the  Section. I hope they prove me and the gaming community wrong. Bottom line $15-16 bucks is OK for a chance/gamble of this bouncing back.,1,The worst survival zombie game ever made.Bugs and hacks everywhere.

In my little mind I think that in a zombie game people should band together to store food secure boundaries and just live. If you were try and do that you'd make that in a safe zone which people can just camp at and get easy kills. The game is flat out broken. It has several features that aren't even in the game yet the microtransactions in it piss me the hell off (even though there can be vendors and such in a town so it's not completely terrible) and the game is just missing so so much.

I also had hopes for the features it promised such as the skill tree and the Stronghold server hosting we where promised with the pioneer and Legendary packages. If not just the Legendary which my friend bought. We haven't gotten any of these features yet. It has been to long waiting and I have given up. There is nothing positive I can say for this game anymore. I used to stand up for it but with the disappointment I have attained throughout the patches. This game in my honest opinion was and I mean every word of it a giant pile of donkey Sh1t.  I wanted to punch my screen every time I got D/C'd from a server for no reason. Also the amount of hackers in this game made me want to cry. There was no playing legit. So i just stopped and I do NOT regret it. This game is terrible and i want my money back. TL;DR: This game sucked barb-wired Dild0s  And I mean that.#Barb-WiredDild0Guy #YOROSHWAG #DoNotBuyOrYourPeePeeWillBeSore #DizzNegga,1,This game had so much potential but is no more than a cash cow.

I've never written a review or bothered with anything like this beforeDo not buy this game! EVER! Yup as you can probably already tell I was unfortunately one of the many poor bastards that jumped on the Steam $3.74 sale bandwagon! Oh wow what a shame. This is by far the most absolutely horrible pathetic lamest crappiest and a few more blankety blank blanks game I have ever played. I've never written a review or bothered with anything like this before but this game has motivated me to do so now. This game is purely pay to maybe win and free to lose and die suffer regret and rage to the extreme. I'll lay out some math for you... They start you out with a flashlight a granola bar and a bottle of water. If you stand there without moving your thirst and hunger degenerate which is fine but it's to the extent that you have to eat and drink something roughly every 10  15 minutes. Huh that's lame. Now you have to find food and water by going into zombie infested areas which isn't too horrible you have to survive that's understandable. But then the map is really small and there's usually about 20  30 players minimum in any server at any time so good luck getting the good stuff as a noob with a flashlight going against hordes of zombies and other dudes with guns and not to mention you have about 30 minutes to do so otherwise you starve to death or die of thirst. But! You can buy food and water in the store! =O Holy crap hallelujah! (Can't believe I spelled that right the first time.) Downside  A bottle of water costs $400 in game cash or a certain amount of gold coin things that you can only get with real money where 5 USD gets you 615 or so. So $400 in game cash for a bottle of water. How hard could that be to get with only a flashlight and 30 minutes to spare? Well according to the Wiki zombies have a 1:10 chance of dropping cash. They only ever really drop about 30-50 bucks in cash each time. So if you're lucky you can afford a single bottle of water in about 30 zombie kills...maybe. And no flashlights don't kill zombies very fast if you're wondering. Now on top of this the voice chat a good idea except people who pay out their asses for this game are as pathetic as what they sound total BLANK-holes that shoot first skip the questions and hump your dead face. Horrible gaming community involved with this game the customer support has never gotten anything but terrible reviews they are obviously only using this game to make money ripping their customers off at any chance they get and don't forget that they can ban you for crashing if they decide to or ban you for no reason at all instead of actually having a passion for game design and providing something at least partially half way decent to play. The graphics suck the game play is worthless and the price is beyond insane. If there are any good reviews ANYWHERE about this game they are most likely being paid by whatever hammer industry that devised this scam to rip people off. You can only play the game at first by playing a male so if you're a girl and want to play as a female you have to get $150000 in game cash to buy the character or spend about $5 to get a character. Every item that you use real life currency to purchase goes BYE BYE if you die nothing is retained after you die. And you have to wait an hour before you can play again on that character. If there's any more crap about this game that I'm missing I'm sure there's plenty of it left out there eventually you'll walk right into the fan spraying all the BLANK enjoy if you give this game a chance I'd strongly suggest seeing the 20/100 metacritic score and avoid this catastrophe. This concludes my review I am a proud survivor of this ridiculous infestation for three and a half hours and now most currently a beyond proud and relieved uninstaller of Infestation Survivor Stories with way more BLANKS then any game should allow. I feel sorry for anyone who gives this game a chance it's not worth it and they only want your money without giving anything in return.,0,Worthless trash. I'm not even going to list the issues the blaringly large % of negative reviews here on Metacritic is already a solid warning that you should not buy this game. Save yourself the dreaded feeling of "oh snap I just wasted $20" and go and buy yourself a kebab and a coke you will be MUCH more satisified.,0,What a bummerthey trying to release the game that haven`t finish yet.And now people who brought it got scammed.Stick with DayZ instead.WarZ is just a piece of crap that they wanna look like DayZ but even betterbut nothing can do anymore with broken gameplay at all and rob money by purchase something...what a joke.War Inc game should not make a game like this!,0,A complete piece of garbage. Some games just rip off others and the results is often mediocre at best but War Z beats records in terms of lazy game development. If trolling had its equivalent in the game industry this game would be a fine example. Stay away from this sorry excuse for a quick cash grab.,4,Full of cheaters. You can find cheats easily in the internet and the development team does not care about it. It's unplayable. But there is one thing that i can tell you: This game is awesome without the hacks. Obviously some weapons are hard to find and a zombie can kill you easily if you're used to play games on the rookie mode. The game is realistic and fun but you can't beat cheatersFull of cheaters.

Also the way the developers already try to monetize an unfinished product (death timers etc..) is sickening.,0,This game is one of 2012's biggest disappointments (if people even believed this would have been successful) The Steam page is full of lies no 100 man servers no skills micro-transactions in an already paid game and a 'final product' that looks more like an Alpha build. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME: That $15 can be spent on many different other games.,0,The worst and most epic disappointing game I have ever seen. I say stay away from it. Do not waste your time and your money my friends. This game is absolutely terrible.,0,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  The developer Sergei Titov is a fraud and A CHEAT and THE GAME IS AS WELL.  The developer himself SHOULD BE IN PRISON FOR ALL OF THE CRAP HE'S PUT OUT OVER THE YEARS.  DOO  NOOOOOOT BUYYYYY THIIIIIIIIS GAAAAMMMMEEEEEE!!!!!!!,0,I bought and played this game and let me tell you. I've never been so dissapointed about a game in my life and i've NEVER been robbed of my money like this before. Save your time and money on something else.,0,This is the worst game i ever bought. They keep making promises and not a single major update hackers everywhere a lot of glitches bugs the zombies are useless its more like a call of duty full of crap. Sold the game for 10 bucks after 3 weeks playing.,0,This game is a complete rip off! Hammer point interactive has LIED to all our faces I don't under stand how people could like or defend this game or hammer point.,0,This game is just horrendous. False advertising is the only reason it sold even a single copy. either that or because they though it was the Day Z standalone.,0,0 in score is too big for this game I thought diablo 3 was the big disappointment in 2012 was totally fooled. This game sucks in every aspect the game is not finished for being sold on Steam the developers dont care about the buyers making funny about this situation and if you say anything you are banned from the forumsI never will buy anything again of hammerpoint,0,Simply "The War Z" with a different name because it was too close to comfort for "World War Z" same old crap same old treatment same terrible old game don't support it don't let anyone else support it and let VALVe know that you don't want this kind of garbage on STEAM. What's even more amazing is the fact that they made no attempts to let people know that Infestation: SurvivorSimply "The War Z" with a different name because it was too close to comfort for "World War Z" same old crap same old treatment same terrible old game don't support it don't let anyone else support it and let VALVe know that you don't want this kind of garbage on STEAM. What's even more amazing is the fact that they made no attempts to let people know that Infestation: Survivor Stories was simply The War Z. Terrible terrible bad.,0,Do not waste your money on this game. This game use to be warz and they renamed it becausenobody was buying the game based on the fact is is garbage.,3,Never played this game nore will i ever play it but i wanted to be the 1000th negative review. So... yeah. I feel less special than i previously anticipated...,2,I bought into the alpha of this around a few months back videos and comments seem to show the same game I was playing back then. I was very patient back then in spite of them doing nothing about the rampant hackers that I would constantly run into.  I was hoping that after a couple of months it would be a little more playable and when I saw it on steam recently I was hoping that it wasI bought into the alpha of this around a few months back videos and comments seem to show the same game I was playing back then.

I was hoping that after a couple of months it would be a little more playable and when I saw it on steam recently I was hoping that it was polished enough (I'm a hopeful idiot lol) to play. It's not.  Oh wait i did notice highway markers on the map now pretty cool. At least the map is pretty close to finished not the TERRAIN just the map SCREEN. about the only thing in the game unfortunately that looks ANY BIT different than it did months ago. The devs were initially biting off of the shooter genre then decided to totally be original and bite off the dayz mod. no one else had done that yet and there were tons of crappy shooters to compete with but only 1 dayz until they decided to rip it off and make a paid + microtransaction-based product worse than a free mod. there should be a medal for that.    Achievement Unlocked: EPiC DEV FAiL,0,2012 War z = 1982 E.T.  This might be worse than the 1982 game... I cant get over the blatant disrespect for their costumers and fans..

Or fortunately request a refund from Steam which I did get.,2,I was originally excited about this game. The DayZ mod was too graphically intense for me and this game seemed to hold the answer.

Already put my money into this game at this point I would not suggest anyone else follow suit. If you have already committed and would like a community to hold out hope in contact someone in BMFZ.,0,This is by far the largest most obvious cash in of DayZ yet. However the sad thing is they didn't even have the audacity to create a somewhat decent game. Its buggy the textures are nothing short of hideous and the developers outright lied to the consumers about the game promising things that never came. If you purchased this game my condolences as you have bought into a Alpha,0,Not only is the game terrible the devs lied about the features present in the game and then blamed the gamers for not liking it.
