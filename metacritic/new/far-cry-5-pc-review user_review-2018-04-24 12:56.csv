Apr  2, 2018,Gr1mr34p3r,10,This game is amazing. I don't really get all the negative Reviews. As for the criticism I agree that the AI can be improved and storywise it might have been better to stick to a named character... Other than that FarCry 5 is an absolute blast to play.

I don't really get all the negative Reviews. As for the criticism I agree that the AI can be improved and storywise it might have been better to stick to a named character... Other than that FarCry 5 is an absolute blast to play. The shooting mechanics have been changed massively compared to the previous games. Weapon ballistics make the game much more realistic and the gunplay way more satisfying. This in combination with the improved hunting mechanics alone allowed me to enjoy hours of roaming in the gorgeous setting of Hope County, Montana without following the main quest. There is a lot of stuff to do in the campaign and in my opinion the story and side missions are quite varied and fun. I really enjoy the new exploration focus and the removal of the minimap. Visually this must be one of the best looking games that I've played lately.
Apr  2, 2018,MassivelyIndie,8,Are you looking to test AI? Perhaps quantify an NPC's reasoning skills? Well you should probably look somewhere else. Even with that said, the game doesn't deserve a knock because there are some very serviceable AI that will KILL you dead! The story is deeper than the harshest critics are allowing.

Even with that said, the game doesn't deserve a knock because there are some very serviceable AI that will KILL you dead! The story is deeper than the harshest critics are allowing. It is well thought out and may seem shallow if you are hell bent on picking it apart....but remember we are here for escapism not a literature study. Its fun, cohesive and climatic in the scope of this game. Gameplay is superb. Like in most Ubi games, it has all what you'd expect and its executed flawlessly thus far. It runs very well and havn't experienced any optimization problems. I am on a GTX 1070 and I'm 60fps+ on ultra. 15 hours in, the game is still a riot of a good time. If you are familiar with the FC series, this setting is as wonderful, open and teaming with wildlife. I like it more than the acclaimed Far Cry 3 tropical setting. While its not as big, in my opinion its much richer. With the countless trails, lakes, rivers, mountains, forests, vistas farms and cabins. It has it all. I can honestly say that this purchase has been worth it so far as I have not even tried the Arcade Mode in which players create maps and objectives for pvp. While that area deserves its own review, don't convolute the two. Far Cry 5 is worth a buy in my opinion.

The games of the series have not changed much since the time of Far Cry 2, but they are selling perfectly. Players are happy with everything - in the general mass only a few with each new part are indignant that one Far Cry from the other is supposedly not distinguish. Games are really similar, it's logical, the series has its own niche, even its genre, in which there is no competition today. Therefore, I will not again raspinatsya on this topic, and I will not reduce the Far Cry 5 assessment for the fact that it is similar to Far Cry 4. I'd rather focus on what is good and new in the game. This time we go to Hope County, Montana - the northern state on the border with Canada. A picturesque peaceful place with clear lakes, dazzlingly beautiful mountains and forests. Here there are plenty of wild places where time flows slowly, and people live a simple village life. But, of course, with the typical American features: checkered sleeveless jackets, crumpled baseball caps, shotguns in pickup trucks and oversized patriotism in the heads. Visual coloring Far Cry 5 works on the top ten. The nature of virtual Montana hits the heart - this is one of the most beautiful games this year, and in our time it's hard to surprise the picture. It is pointless to describe this. Mountain rivers, wheat fields and impenetrable coniferous forests are perfectly combined with well-maintained farms, pastures and tiny towns, creating an incredibly cozy, warm atmosphere. Even despite the GTA-chaos. And it's not so much in technology, as in the scrupulous manual work of the authors of the game - for all these years Ubisoft still got a hand and learned how to make worthy, sticky open worlds. The finest elaboration here in everything - from natural species, to interiors and the installation of street lamps. Far Cry 5 is very nice to watch. Always. It's nice to listen to it, because the game performed perfectly on three sides: an excellent sound design, an excellent original soundtrack from Dan Romer and a crazy selection of licensed tracks - the best punk playlist in games since the times, probably FlatOut 2. My rating Far Cry 5 10 | 10
Apr  5, 2018,strongchong00,10,I honestly have no idea what all the negative reviewers are talking about. Everyone I know loves this game, and I absolutely love this game as well. If you are a fan of the previous Far Cry games, you will absolutely eat this one up. Freaking. Awesome.

However the game's ARCADE mode is pretty fun to goof off in with your friends submitting player made maps to create scenarios which I could see being an additional few hours of content. Also these little events are a decent thing to do when you have a slow day and decide to do them to get any cosmetic or different weapon skins.I do Like it how the devs are bringing back Far Cry 3 in the season pass. However you could access FC3 at May 29th 2018 and DLCs April 2018. The upcoming DLCs seems to be interesting twists in the American setting, my most favorite is the Vietnam DLC and the Mars one. For a 60 dollar game I could recommend this game to a friend that enjoys completing the games 100%, I know that I did enjoy the game and the Story.

The characters in them simple spout the same few lines over and over with different words. This is probably meant to "build characters", but having them doing the same thing over and over, spouting nonsense, isn't what I call a good use of my time. Usually I watch all the cutscenes in a game (on the off chance there is usable information there), but in this game I just had to start bypassing them. Cutscenes in Far Cry 5 are completely useless. MAGIC BULLETSI vehemently hate the person(s) who designed the marked or hunted "missions". They are the antithesis of open world and they don't even make sense in the context of the game. You are doing something (as in you have something you want to do), but then people just come up to you with magic bullets and capture you. No chance of getting away from that. In the context of the game, that would be the end of the game. Personally, I've killed thousands of those cultists. So, if they would capture me, they wouldn't let me live.

Apr 17, 2018,sprinkill,7,This is your basic Far Cry game - nothing more, nothing less. The assault rifle's accuracy is terrible, and it's not just because of bullet drop.

You're basically not able to hit the broad side of a barn from 100 meters away. The rounds aren't just affected by the force of gravity, but apparently also by the rotation of the earth and extreme crosswinds/mini-cyclones. The bow and arrow, on the other hand, is extremely accurate in that the arrows are only affected by gravity, which is basically linear across distance. The graphics are great on PC, and the game runs flawlessly on an i7-8700K. The world is also meticulously crafted and immersive. The only major drawback is the frequent cutscene hijacking. They've done this in all the FarCrys, but they really laid it on thick in this one. It's pretty common to be meandering along aimlessly and then suddenly get pulled into some boring cutscene where you're forced to listen to some lengthy monologue from one of the game's villains. These will often culminate in some sort of battle royale with real or imagined persons or apparitions, respectively. It's frustrating and grating. Also, I originally rated this game as an 8/10, but had to knock it down to a 7/10 after playing it for several more hours and experiencing the unusually and unnecessarily short campaign. The game really tries to rush you through the main story. In fact, it's the only game I've ever played where I found that I was progressing way faster than I actually thought I was (if that makes any sense at all). For example, missions don't necessarily advance the story and push you forward to "boss battles." By this I mean, merely killing NPCs advances your progress meter in a given area of the game, and once it hits a certain number, then you're cutscene hijacked to a boss battle. It doesn't take a particularly long time to fill up those progress meters, either. You could conceivably finish this game in twelve hours. The reason why this is odd is because the world is pretty big (not Witcher 3 big, but big nonetheless), so it's not clear to me why the developers wanted to "Call of Duty" the campaign length. They had plenty of digital real estate to work with, and there's a lot of side missions, so it's not like they didn't have voice actors on hand. It's like the writers and the map developers worked in completely separate installations and never communicated about their respective visions. Also, the villains and characters are basically never developed at all, and this is entirely because of the remarkably short campaign length. It's by far the shortest campaign from any of the Far Crys. Also, I agree with others that have noted that you'll encounter enemies every 100 yards, roughly. Not so much whilst ambling about the woods, but definitely on the road way. I think if you pay an extra ten bucks for the "deluxe edition," you get a helicopter with machine guns and rockets equipped from the moment you're able to access a helicopter (which is very early on). That's not a small advantage, either. The helicopter essentially allows you to rain death down on your enemies from on high with infinite ammo. With no helicopter, you're essentially fighting them off with a musket or bow and arrow (see first paragraph). You're AI partners will come in handy - so far, I've unlocked the archer (female, can't remember name), and a grenadier named "Herk." They're both equally useful in their own right. Anyway, I recommend the game, particularly if you've enjoyed past Far Crys.

Far Cry 3 had been fun, but the player character and the "good" people had been atrocious and cringeworthy to play as. No character customization made it a rather unpleasent game to play in terms of wanting to actually be that character. Then there were the absolutely terrible boss battles .. serious let downs with repetitive QTE events and dull endurance sequences. Now .. this is Far Cry 5 .. aaaand .. it feels pretty much uh .. the same. As a matter of fact, i can hardly separate it from Ghost Recon Wildlands in terms of structure. A large worldmap (not near as large as Wildlands though) that is fairly pretty to look at. (again Wildlands looks better for the scenery, but in terms of detail Far Cry 5 appears to be nicer)  .. both games have rather terrible AI with enemies that can easily be "trapped" at doorways . and throw themselves into a bottleneck situation in what can only be described as pure suicide. The vehicles feel good so far, the mini-missions are standard. Now is there anything outstanding? ... Not really. The story is OK-ish .. about on a level of a heap 80s action movie. You are good, they are bad .. go kill thousands of them, cause you are GOOD! (and not a psychopatic mass murderer at all) .. no chance to seek a diplomatic or peaceful solution (but its not that kind of game .. ) Well, at least there is a limited character customization and the player character is bland enough (in a positive way) that he/she is not a total jerk like Far Cry 3. However .. the game lives and falls with its bad guy. And i just dont feel it. It might be kind of a ballsy move to make the bad guys white, religious right wing fundamentalists ... but they are not near as exciting as this one pirate guy from Far Cry 3 .. its actually about as bland as the bad guy(s) from Wildlands. But the game runs well, looks pretty and offers good action game mechanics for a semi open world game on what feels like a fairly small area. Well above average, but not outstanding.

Cons: The story was either lazily written or it was chopped up due to time constraints. Extremely annoying and all too often no way out scenarios that result in you feeling frustrated and annoyed. I would be singing this games praise but for a few things that have turned an otherwise amazing experience completely sour. Far Cry 5 could have and should been the best of the far cry games so far but due to either sloppy and very lazy writing or horrible production it's the worst. The premise of the story is excellent but the execution of it is atrocious. I'll try very hard not to include spoilers but suffice it to say they make the protagonist and the antagonist not only impotent but stupid as well. I have never seen a story either so lazily written or so horribly rushed. It makes no logical sense. The story pins the protagonist into a no win scenario time and time again, giving the antagonist opportunity after opportunity to end the conflict. Once or twice would have been fine but it gets tedious and annoying after 20 times. Do the antagonists act on those opportunities? Take a guess. To add insult to injury it resorts to the use of deus ex machina to get him out. It reeks of rushed and cut story or amateurish writing. The game play is standard far cry albeit without the towers. The graphics are beautiful and the setting is amazing. The music is wonderful and probably the best part of the game. All of these things add up to what should have been the best game of 2018, but with the no win scenarios every 20 minutes it ruins it. TL;DR: They botched this either due to bad writers or a moronic production team. If you don't care about the story making no logical sense this is a great game.

In a way the bad characters can be observed as also good, depends on how you look at it. There is always an explanation of why the characters are acting in the way they do. We have funny, serious, lovable and broken characters, a good mix.Graphics are good and the music is just astounding, even if there are not a lot of songs. All in all, I enjoyed the game up until the ending when I felt I did everything for nothing. That's why in my opinion it isn't serious enough. I still give 7 out of 10 because it is overall enjoyable.

Apr 19, 2018,CynicMimic,5,Well, Ubisoft have no idea how to pace their gameplay anymore. Far Cry 5 never gives you a moment of peace, it just gives you constant chaos.

Far Cry 5 never gives you a moment of peace, it just gives you constant chaos. You're constantly being attacked, or doing the attacking yourself, and no-matter where you are, there is always action going on around you. There are always people chasing you, people screaming for your help, and you quickly get inundated with more missions than you know what to do with. There's always someone calling you over for a side mission, multiple voices speaking at once, advising you to do a thousand different things, while gunshots crack through the air all around you and explosions go off in the distance. It's just a sensory overload of multiple activities happening at once, all the time, with little meaning behind any of them. The problem with this design philosophy is that if all a game offers me is constant action, how can I be expected to keep appreciating that for 30 hours? There has to be a balance, and there has to be downtime. Downtime gives the action meaning, because it keeps things surprising, it keeps things interesting, and it gives you time to breathe. It lets you explore and take in the scenery, collect yourself, and prepare for the next encounter. If all that exists in a game is constant action, then the action doesn't really mean anything. The action quickly gets stale because there's nothing to supplement it. Consequently, Far Cry 5 is predictable and repetitive, and it didn't take long before I found it to be utterly exhausting. Don't get me wrong, it's an adequate game, I suppose. Everything works as intended and the gameplay at its core is still fun, it's just that the design is so damn cluttered, which just drags everything down so hard. I'll pick out a few things I like... I like that the radio towers are gone. I like that crafting is more incidental now and can be mostly ignored, which is a nice surprise from Ubisoft these days. I like that they added a way to choose your sex at the start, but I'm not sure why they bothered, because they put very little effort into it (if you choose female, characters will still refer to you by male pronouns). Apart from that though it's just another Far Cry game. The same thing all over again in a different location, except this time Ubisoft's obsession with filling the map with "stuff to do" and "things happening" has reached critical mass, to the point where none of it is even the slightest bit immersive or engaging.

There are some few annoying bugs4. Game's world sometimes is way too chaotic - you can't drive in a new area calmly for even 2 minutes without encountering lots of random enemies, then bear attacks you out of nowhere, then helicopters starts shooting rockets at you, then reinforcements come etc. So If you want to travel calmly, you need to do it in the woods by foot.5. This game lacks of guns. There's only about two proper assault rifles - AR-C and AK-M and those too also aren't so good too.6. Those f*****g microtransactions. Although you simply can buy everything with in-game currency, the prices for weapons and cars (boats, planes) skins are insanely high.7. No more crafting. Instead of that you have to make lots of stupid challenges to get perk points and with those you can unlock new abilities like extra gun slot, carry more ammo, swim faster, walk silently etc. (sp for example: you wanna get 3 perk points? kill 15 enemies with flamethrower, wanna get another 2 or 3 points? hunt down 3 grizzlies etc...). I haven't tried co-op, although I've read lots of forum about how stupid it is, when someone joins friend's game there's no story progression, no guns progression etc... For me Far Cry always been about singleplayer and I still think it's worth buying it. You'll get lots of different quests, great gameplay there's really a lot of doing in this game. EDIT: Those gamers who says it's too easy, put difficulty on hard, turn off x-ray vision and indicators as well. Then the gameplay, for example liberating outposts will be pain in the ass, no joke.

Great gospel choralThe Montana landscape is beautiful; nuff said. Whether you're enjoying the serenity of fishing salmon at the embankment of a lake during sunset, or being chased off a cliff by a grizzly bear through the lush folliage of a pine forest, you will almostly certainly take a moment each time you play this game to remind yourself how virtually stunning the in-game world looks. Great gospel choral music and the old-school country tunes just add to the immersion. No game's perfect, but I think Ubisoft made a decent effort with this one. Admittingly, the gunplay choices are a bit over-simplified, the bullet physics laggy at times, and the vehicle dynamics clunky; but, to be honest, it's a needle in a haystack problem; if don't go looking for it, you probably won't notice it's a big issue. As for the plot, it is a bit far-fetched (and, at times, cringe-worthy), but hey, the game is called "Far Cry" for a reason; so don't be surprised when it's about a self-deluded hill-billy cult proclaming the post-apocalyptic testament as an excuse to takeover this sleepy rural Montana town, and no surprise, your job is to liberate it. But the great thing is you can do it in any order you want and at your pace. Word of advice: take time to explore the game, free roam across the sweeping landscapes and enjoy it; don't rush to tediously complete all the missions at once. My two cents: It's worth it. Played 48+ hours of it. Fun solo. Fun-ner with mates in co-op (albeit, servers do drop-out at busier times like Saturday night which can be infuriating). Lots of shiggles to be had. Beautiful and wonderful open world game.
