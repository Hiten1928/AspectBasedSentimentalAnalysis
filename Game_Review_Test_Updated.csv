Overwatch,negative,combat,3,Please do not buy this game because it is a SCAM. Unbalanced characters and matchmaking
Overwatch,neutral,combat,4,Overwatch is okay
Devil may Cry,negative,action,0,it's an horrid piece of casual gaming... i would give it a 5 if it wasn't supposed to be a dmc game... ninja theory and capcom killed my fauvorite series
Devil may Cry,negative,action,0,Devil May Cry in this game is the name only. Everything else didnt make sense with the franchise. Change the name and this game can deceive some respect.
Devil may Cry,negative,action,0,"Pathetic excuse to use the DMC name. 30fps no difficulty and no styles make this a gigantic step backwards from the previous games. The story is a rip off of ""They Live"" and the dialogue is something that would make a grade-school bully cringe in embarrassment. And last of all the characters...oh the characters...they are a walking insult to the old incarnations and a constant middlePathetic excuse to use the DMC name. 30fps no difficulty and no styles make this a gigantic step backwards from the previous games.

Devil may Cry,negative,action,0,dmc goes down with this releaseeverything is bad except graphics(don't care)no matched for previous onesbetter to play previous editions again than this s__
Call of Duty,neutral,combat,5,"this one really just seemed quite ""meh"" for me."
Call of Duty,negative,combat,3,much worse than in Advanced Warfare. Why you can recommend?
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,3,The main problem I have with this game is that its matchmaking is AWFUL
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,2,IM GOING TO GIVE MY REVIEW ON BROCKTONS MEDIC SKILLS IN the popular game over watch he must be the worst medic ever he wonders around and starts getting a killed by a tracer he would yell for help but never say where he is. then dies and blames it on u. If u insult him once he will watch u die and not heal u . If I ever say dva he will not shut up until u say brocktons waifu .

If u insult him once he will watch u die and not heal u . If I ever say dva he will not shut up until u say brocktons waifu . He got a message from a guy with Down syndrome telling him that he's a good Ana so whenever u mention Ana he'll tell u how great he is at Ana . Probably the worst medic I've ever played with
Devil may Cry,positive,action,8,This is not a bad game
Devil may Cry,positive,action,8,This is a great action with the most sophisticated combat system I ever saw in arcade slasher
Call of Duty,neutral,combat,1,By far the most stupid game
Devil may Cry,negative,action,0,Played DMC1 when it came out and I was so impressed with all the style that I kept playing till DMD. Played DMC3 till DMD as well because I like DMC1 so much but I thought it was acceptable. I thought DMC4 deserved a 0/10 and I've stopped caring ever since. DmC is practically a new game. If the new generation enjoys it then so be it. I never understood what most kids see in movies likePlayed DMC1 when it came out and I was so impressed with all the style that I kept playing till DMD.

Overwatch,positive,combat,8,Blizzard has released a game that shows lots of promise with addicting gameplay
Overwatch,positive,gameplay,8,I don't normally write reviews for games but after reading some of the negative reviews as well as some of the perfect rated reviews I felt the need to write my own. So what do you get with Overwatch? With Overwatch you get a very well put together game to play with good graphics
Devil may Cry,negative,action,1,This reboot lacks. While being a mediocre hack and slash game with a “style system” mixed in
Devil may Cry,negative,action,1,Design of the enemies in this game is the worst. Level design is crap. Shameful design of the main character. Color design is awful. Gameplay is very clumsy. The plot is stupid and boring. This game is an absolute failure!
Overwatch,negative,gameplay,3,I feel like i have been ripped off
Overwatch,negative,combat,3,Before I start... Yes... That's right. I gave this game a 3... That's right... A blizzard game gets a 3. Please do read on before just plain labeling me a hater. Because I do want blizzard to make a good game. I really do! Know why? Because they have made some great ones. Diablo 1 and 2 for example. Starcraft 1! I know they can pull off great games. It's just that they didn't this timeBefore I start... Yes... That's right. I gave this game a 3... That's right... A blizzard game gets a 3. Please do read on before just plain labeling me a hater.

It's just that they didn't this time lol. #Neverjoinupwithactivision lol Pros... Decent game play... Decent art direction/graphics... Decent/stable frame rate... Decent online experience... Cons... No split screen...No story mode...No survival/coop mode...Online only...Multiplayer only...Lack of content...Low skill gap. It's basically team fortress for scrubs. Just look at those huge hit boxes
Devil may Cry,positive,action,8,Im glad to see there's some people with an open mind on here. Yeah they changed up dante and made the game easier to open up the audience. But deep down in side its still DMC and its a good game if you can get passed the changes. Graphics look great on my hires monitor and 3D vision support is a big plus too. Not to mention the game runs flawlessly which is an achievement in its own nowIm glad to see there's some people with an open mind on here.

I honestly think the combat is improved this time around too. Yeah the enemies are a bit easier and arent as cool as past dmc titles. But there is a wider variety in moves which should please past devil may cry fans like myself. DMC has never really been about the story in my opinion
Call of Duty,positive,combat,8, this is one of the best COD in years! It's a lot of fun: great gameplay (it's similar to AW but a bit better imho)
Call of Duty,positive,combat,8,I don't know why people hate this game so much. It is another Call Of Duty tittle so not much has changed but it is still way better that Advanced Warfare and it can't be compared to the absolute disater Ghosts. The game offers a lot of content
