"free to play" my butt.,0,That was complete garbage. I downloaded after playing dota 2 for awhile and wanted to try out another one of these games turns out you can only pick from 10 characters while others can pick from every character that is funny.

It comes down to the game has really bad graphics and looks your team forces you (or you can force your team) to go into one lane out of three and sit there for a while doing insignificant nothings and later on if you team feels like it you will group up and go around the map finding the enemy team.  The game is geared at a very young audience (pre-teens) and is basic enough to get you little brother into video gaming.  You have to buy all the characters you want to play and for most people it can be very expensive to fully enjoy what the game has to offer.  The designers fail to realize that the people who express their beliefs on the forums are few and far between the people who don't go to the forums and just keep playing the game actually have no influence on the game's development because if you like something its too bad because the developers will never know.  The game its self  and the community is stressful depending on your level of play may not even speak your language.  If your pure goal is to find a game that is enjoyable to play day after day this is not the game for you.,0,Not worth the time and effort. There are a number of things wrong with this game as someone who has played since almost beta it has even made me want to leave.

Unless you're an extreme hardcore gamer who enjoys being trolled constantly and dealing with poor servers and patches.

I told them no one helped me at start w/red buff but kept insulting "stop crying" when he was in fact crying I'm not ganking them after not a single one helped me with buff. I got left behind in levels so I needed to catch-up not try to gank and fail or even feeding in the process. They kept flaming insulting me until the point I had to mute everyone. Believe me you can't play with **** you just can't. Game started going better I unmuted them then the ones that insulted me started ordering me around. As if ... when they flamed and haven't helped one bit. Even if we were winning one of the scums kept typing in /all to report me. I said to /all to report them for not helping flame insults after which they both acted like innocent little angels. "we didn't flame you" "we never insulted you" "we just told them to report you that's not an insult" ... -_- How scummy do you have to be to act like a total scum insult flame harass then behave as if you never did any of that and that it's actually the other one who did? I reported both then they reported me and said they'll ban me. I said no you'll be banned. They laughed and said riot is too lazy and they don't ban anymore. I said it's not riot that bans but the community through the tribunal. **I was afk like 5 min and then I see a pop-up that I've been banned for 14 days for my recent behavior in my recent matches.** Really? I've been harassed abused and insulted and I'm the one banned? And I only played like 10 matches the last 2 years :)) The mail I got was sent in spam (seem appropriate) and showed as evidence my last match (quite biased because it didn't include what others have said at all. very biased and rudimentary). **I thank you for reminding me why I quit league of legends and never came back. A game full of scums and curated by scums. Kinda reminds me of ArcheAge². Thank you for stopping me from wasting time only getting angry insulted and harassed.** **If you think of coming back to play League of Legends don't. You'll regret it.**,0,Good for newbies and kids but not really interesting if you're looking for a quality game to spend you time on.

The "good" half of the community is very active in reddit and is helping riot finding bugs or they are giving requests and ideas that could improve  the game. Finally i think this game will have a lot more years of activity and will be updating frequently with new gamemodes and champions  every month or every 2 months.,5,Not a bad game though unlocking the characters can take some time if you aren't willing to shell out some cash.

It doesn't give anything that is new to gaming. LoL is free to play so that's a good point. I had problems with registration though. I had to try like 5 times. LoL is competitive. Too competitive.

It's pretty hard to tell whether player is actually a beginner or noob. Graphics and sound effects are pretty good though.I'm not into this game too much but my brother is. When I asked him to stop rapidly clicking he said he he has to do that. I mean what's the point of game if you can break your mouse in month because it's "that" kind of game? Also the game makes many people really angry and they keep saying that they don't believe in human race anymore (that's what I've seen in many LoL videos). In other words  this game makes people more aggressive.In my opinion LoL shouldn't be your "primary" game. Rather a game that you play from time to time. If it wasn't free to play I would not buy it.,0,This game is bad in every way. Crumby graphics bad programming and a greedy company abusing the "Pay to Win" BS.

Tho i have switched to Dota 2 because i find it better. It still play LoL sometimes but not as much as Dota 2.,7,There are some key differences between LoL and Dota 2 which makes me think League of Legends is a better game (even if the developers are a bunch of massive censorshipping controversal cu nts) and I'll do my best to state these below. 1. The way gold is handled: a) In Dota 2 If you die with any significant amount of gold you are guaranteed to lose at least 20-50% of it (and even allThere are some key differences between LoL and Dota 2 which makes me think League of Legends is a better game (even if the developers are a bunch of massive censorshipping controversal cu nts) and I'll do my best to state these below. 1. The way gold is handled: a) In Dota 2 If you die with any significant amount of gold you are guaranteed to lose at least 20-50% of it (and even all of it in some cases) on a frequent basis If you do not seemingly micromanage your shopping through a celluar phone before dying. The mechanic itself is stupid and pays  no thought whether the gold being stolen is from someone that has no items at all or minimal income and relentlessly penalizes them by repeatedly taking away the little resources they have. This becomes severely painful if you play a support character since many of the items they need are quite expensive and once you die maybe 1-2 times with 500-1000+ gold you're majorly crippled for the rest of the entire game. LoL has none of this and you keep every penny even If you die repeatedly as the one who kills you gets a simple bounty. b) In Dota 2 there are unwritten rules that It is mandatory for any support character to constantly empty their pockets in order to buy things such as couriers wards dust of disapperance/decept and sometimes even excessive tango (healing items). Sure this makes sense as they do not have the biggest emergency to aquire items. Then.. Having the duty to buy these things and almost never be able to last-hit creeps/NPC's would be a fair point to make the assumption that support characters would have some additional support of income no? Wrong. Dota 2 spits in the face of anyone who wants to play support by giving them the slowest possible income of any heroes and stomping them into the ground whenever they die taking all the little gold they have. It's utterly moronic and creates nothing but conflicts in the form of certain support characters wanting a few dibs on last-hitting enemy heroes for quick cash or just trying to farm creeps by themselves. LoL balances this out significantly by allowing support characters to buy certain items that grants them extra gold whenever they're close to a mob dying that they did not kill. While the ones killing do get more gold It is the best step possible to balancing things for people that want to play a supporting role while also giving everyone in-game free items that create wards meaning less mandatory cash spending If you support. c) In Dota 2 you can buy items at any time and anywhere during the battle and have your purchases delivered to you by a courier. Getting the courier to begin with for gold creates an unnecessary cash-pool for supports to throw money into renders most stuff like boots of travel extremely undesireable (except for moronic be-everywhere-at-once tactics for certain heroes) and leaves every visit one takes to the town fountain to be due to surviving with 1 hp left from a battle. This mechanic also causes imbalance in the game itself by making strong recovery items be insanely valuable especially the Heart of Tarrasque which boasts a whopping 80% winrate to whomever manages to purchase it as seen on the multi-million statistical website Dotabuff. And even with that you have to consider the dozens of new player who buy wrong items for wrong heroes or just people trolling & feeding and causing intentional losses. It's true stat could easily be 85-90% winrate. 2. Matchmaking: I'll be blunt. The match-making in Dota 2 does simply NOT WORK. For ANYONE. It more than frequently matches up complete beginners with people boasting 300-2000+ hours into the game and often slaps up groups with people up against soloers. This used to be somewhat bearable as there was an option before the "Give Diretide" incident to disable all grouping in the settings but now It's been removed as the MM is still horribly broken and ontop of that also very uncustomizeable. While LoL is of course not without fault It has a much MUCH more stable MM where the only times you'll meet elites is when you partner up with one. 3. Balance/Gameplay: The devs in Dota 2 has repeatedly shown their complete and utter incompetence in all matter of balance be it not properly using their public testing servers or just not giving a damn about facerolling heroes such as Mirana Drow Ranger Death Prophet Pudge etc whereas LoL has huge tendencies to have gigantic flip-overs in games where one team will immensively be winning (due to some rather seemingly overpowered early-on heroes) just to be overwhelmed later in in the game since LoL allows everyone to really flesh their builds out thanks to no gold loss on death. I've personally lost count on how many times my team wanted to surrender played 15-30 more minutes and ended up winning by a mile thanks to teamwork and coordination from being repeatedly defeated. LoL also boasts a MUCH better response time in moves. Character limit But TL:DR = LoL is best.,10,Constantly being developed balanced and are very dedicated to their community this game is not for those who are rubbish it takes lots of time to adjust to. REMEMBER DO NOT RATE THE GAME BASED ON IT'S HORRIBLE TOXIC COMMUNITY IN LOWER LEVELS THAT IS NOT LEAGUES FAULT!,10,Addictive game that you will never get sick of.

It is popularly known as LoL and it currently holds the title of most widely played video game in the world. It has over twenty seven million active players daily. It is so large that it has even spawned its own slang vocabulary that everyLeague of LegendsLeague of Legends is a videogame played on the PC it is a part of a genre of games called MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). It is popularly known as LoL and it currently holds the title of most widely played video game in the world. It has over twenty seven million active players daily. It is so large that it has even spawned its own slang vocabulary that every player understands. What would compel such a large amount of people to log in and play the same game every day? The answer lies in its simple yet deceptively complex structure of play. One can compare it to a team oriented version of chess. The old saying rings true easy to learn hard to master.The basic concept of the game revolves around ten players divided into two teams of five players each. These two teams engage in a battle to destroy their opponent’s base referred to as the “Nexus”. The path to said Nexus is defended by magical towers that will try stop you. In order to overcome this your team must work together with their selected characters called “Champions” in-game to eventually overcome the enemy team and destroy their Nexus. In order to defend itself each base will automatically send a number of soldiers into battle these soldiers are referred to as “creeps”. When creeps are killed champions are awarded with gold and experience. These are two very important resources.Gold allows your champion to buy items such as swords shields and magical potions. Experience on the other hand allows you to “level up” your character which makes him or her stronger and unlocks access to new abilities.The main way to play is the multiplayer mode against other people but there is also a singleplayer mode where you play against the computer’s artificial intelligence. Overall the real excitement comes from besting your human opponents on the battlefield. Before getting into a real battle against other players the game offers a tutorial that focuses on teaching new players the basics which we have already covered. It’s essential to learn these concepts and more before engaging human opponents in the arena.The arena in question is called the Summoner’s Rift it is the main map where the battle takes place. An average battle will run anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes the perfect length to have a good time with friends and possibly play another without taking up your entire day. While in a match there are no breaks or pauses so one needs to pay attention for the duration of the match. The only down time provided to you occurs when your character dies. At that point you are no longer in control and need to wait for a certain amount of time before being allowed to enter the arena again.In a typical match you will find a wide variety of champions that all have strengths and weaknesses. One such champion is Fizz a powerful fish that uses his trident to quickly strike and dash away from a fight. The key to gathering gold and experience lies in killing creeps and enemy champions while preventing your own champion from dying. A champion is only as strong as the amount of gold and experience he’s managed to collect. This is where League of Legends thrives the careful balance between player skill and mechanics. Eventually by playing different champions one will learn how to counter and predict enemy map movements.League of Legends is what is called a “free to play game” meaning the upfront cost to enjoy it is nothing however some parts of the game are restricted until you pay for instance there are 123 champions in the game but you do not have access to all of them for free. They use a rotation system of 10 selected champions offered for free each week allowing you to try them out before making a purchase. If you fall in love with any of them you can turn your real money into what is called “Riot points” (Riot is the name of the developer). If however you wish to acquire a champion without spending actual money you have the option of only playing the freely available champions while earning “influence points” for each match. Eventually you will gather enough influence points to trade them for champions. After a few hundred matches it is easy to fall into the temptation and open up your wallet to buy Riot points to speed up the process after all Riot has to get their money from somewhere especially since they are advertising it as a free game.The developer knows a lot about what makes a team oriented game tick. After your first few matches you learn that communication is key. Riot provide an in-game chat for typing out your strategies but as it can be hard to type in the heat of battle they have also included a set of warning commands that will visually display icons on the map this way your team can communicate quickly and efficiently as they seek to take objectives. Alternatively you can use a third party voice chat program like Skype. However most players rely on the in-game chat system.The visuals of the game are very cartoonish at first glance this allows the game to run well on less powerful computers which is another reason why so many people play it. Light hearted actions such as visual gags and special dance moves that can be executed mid game highlight the emphasis on friendly fun yet a highly competitive environment lies beneath the surface.As far as stability is concerned sometimes players will experience delays as they wait to log in to a match other times they will encounter visual bugs. Overall Riot spend a great deal of time ensuring that their game operates as it should with little to no down time. Time is money after all!League of Legends is not hard to get into but quite challenging to master. Updates and patches keep the game well balanced boosting or toning down the power of various items and champions. Sometimes an update will bring a surprise twist to the game mode slightly changing the game mechanics or introduce a new champion or changes to the map. In this sense the game is constantly evolving and improving.As an example my favorite alteration to the game mechanics was a mode called “Hexakill”: It allows six instead of the standard five champions per team leading to some chaotic battles. The mode was so successful Riot extended its duration for an additional two weeks. As in the normal mode the main objective is to destroy the enemy nexus but now you had the possibility of scoring a hexakill. Getting multiple kills in this game is one of the most gratifying feelings the game has something like a sports announcer that will yell things such as “GOD LIKE!” when you slaughter your foes in battle.While League of Legends could be considered repetitive in that you always have the same objective and always play on the same map the variety lies in the champion combinations their items and the varied skill level of your opponents. It is a very deep and rewarding game of higher strategy typical of the MOBA genre. No match ever plays out the same way especially if you are playing with friends. The joy comes from mastering your champions constantly learning new tactics and honing your skills. Most importantly you need to maintain a positive attitude and play as a team to emerge victorious. You will not win every match but hopefully you will learn something valuable with each loss. Ultimately I feel League of Legends is a great example of a video game that offers countless hours of entertainment and the possibility of socializing with other people from all over the world showcasing the best of what gaming and global connectivity can be.  In closing I have finally found a game that I love to hate it can be a massive time sink but in the end I am happy to have wasted both time and money on this great MOBA.,2,I have HAD IT! I've been a dedicated LoL player for several years and I've seen all of RIOT's crap. From the disgusting character balancing (nerfing up champs buffing op champs) to overpriced microxactions dramatically overhauling champs voices/appearances after you've purchased them without your consent the brain-dead-and-totally-not-band-aid-solution that was Tribunal (thatI have HAD IT! I've been a dedicated LoL player for several years and I've seen all of RIOT's crap. From the disgusting character balancing (nerfing up champs buffing op champs) to overpriced microxactions dramatically overhauling champs voices/appearances after you've purchased them without your consent the brain-dead-and-totally-not-band-aid-solution that was Tribunal (that backfired so hard they shut it down) to FULLY AUTOMATED PERMA-BAN SYSTEM to the most...depressing immature self-indulgent braggadocious  narcissistic report-happy self-contradicting impossible unreasonable fun-depriving unimaginative op-champ spamming excessively elitist personality-starved and laughably stupidest community I have ever had the displeasure of being in contact with. Name any online game right now; WoW CS:GO HoN ect I don't care; LoL has the - indisputably hands down - THE WORST community I have ever seen. The first thing your opponents say is "omg im so high lol and my penis is huge" from player named Anime69forever and your teammates say "OMG IM LAGGING! MY CAT SAT ON THE KEYBOARD! MY MOUSE DIED!" and the 40 min flame war begins. I don't even have room to discuss all the garbage I've got on this company from bait-and-switch tactics with the new Gangplank/Captain skin to deliberately making a tank meta so they can BANK on the anti-tank champs or make a new one or how they handled Riven. "Hmm...Riven's op. Nerfs or more skins? PSSH DUH!" to which the community says "shes not op she takes skill".....HUH? How is that even relevant? What does the skillcap have to do with the champ's maximum potential? Nothing. They have to push this idea that they're winning cuz their skillllldddd because their divorcing parents don't have anything nice to say about them. Which leaves me to the basic review of the game. It's a casual game. Everything is easy to play as has 4 buttons and is mostly a roulette to whatever morons you're matched with. Admittedly if and when it all works its some of the most refreshing fun I've ever had in a game. I really do love it but if 2 of your teammates wana go back and forth about each other's moms instead of playing guess who isn't winning? The enemy is playing as the same 5 broken champs that smash everything then they get fed off of your idiotic teammates; leaving you no choice but to turtle and wait out the game. By the 20 min mark the score is 0-30 and you just hide in your base waiting for the enemy to kill the neutral boss to get its buff then clean you up as everyone votes "no" to surrendering so they can spend the 30 min turtle flaming on! "REPORT MY TEAM TOXIC" then re-queue and repeat until you barf. But a recent incident was the last straw. I'm guessing my old email got hacked and the only override was using an old dead phone I don't have anymore. Problem is that old email was the one verified with my LoL account. When I requested help it started promising enough but out of nowhere the genius player support says "I'LL FIX IT! I'LL ASK FER A PASSWURD CHAAAAAAAANGEEE11!!!11" and permanently locked me out of my own account. There goes 100's of dollars in champs skins and services 1000's of hours of gameplay and any friends I met on there. GONE. FOREVER. POOF. (You may now ignore the previous paragraph and say "well its ur fault fer not changign email fone #"). Why should I spend any time/money/effort on a LoL account if there are soooo many ways for it to just POOF? None and neither should you. Automated perma-ban system clumsy customer support screwy email accounts auto-afk ban system (read other negative reviews) or false accusation (i.e. abusable "report" button where RIOT gets anal if you so much as critique someone) are just a few ways to lose years of gameplay instantly. Their customer support is absurdly incompetent. Which is such a shame! When the game works its amazing! I love it! I love its art style music voice acting character design controls variety of champs sound effects it really is a well crafted game but whoever is in charge is destroying it like how the same 10 champions are spammed every game and the community RUTHLESSLY defends the game's balance saying "You're still in bronze (lowest elo) because you suck" when if you look at any of their profiles they only play 2 champs (i.e. Riven [600 games] Vayne [200] Thresh [50].) It is....such a mess. Don't play it. Convince your friends to stop playing it. Worst community worst community management worst balancing incompetent customer service numerous ways that their "ban bot" 's roulette will land on your name community has no mind of their own resorting to being sycophants for RIOT or the pro scene over-priced micro transactions new champ is always broken to ensure sales broken champs get more skins instead of nerfs the list goes on forever. I've put up with a lot of their crap but changing my password w/o my consent to lock me out was it. Im done,0,The best MMO game ever+THE WORST  game made for make money and btw makes you lose a lot of time playing. If you are competitive i don't recommend you to download this game because the amout of toxic player that are in rankeds games is uncontable.,5,Fun game but the community makes the experience miserable most of the time.  Teammates excessively bicker and people purposely lose.  Go in with a full team or expect to be frustrated.,7,League of Legends is an interesting game down on paper with some neat concepts and re-hashed ideas.The first great thing about the game is it's basic outlook but complex and indepth potential  you can literally just play  a champion how you want and it can potentially work but if you want to be the best you can follow some really indepth guides and learn some neat tricks and tipsLeague of Legends is an interesting game down on paper with some neat concepts and re-hashed ideas.The first great thing about the game is it's basic outlook but complex and indepth potential  you can literally just play  a champion how you want and it can potentially work but if you want to be the best you can follow some really indepth guides and learn some neat tricks and tips and I think it's good for a game to have this potential. On this point I do feel that some champions are a bit too 'cookie-cutter' and that there is only one way to build them for example you could never take attack damage on LeBlanc. In terms of gameplay I feel that champion/character balance is somewhat off and the way in which Riot brings out overpowered champions just so people will buy them is highly off putting from the start. What's more is that as new mechanics are added to the game and new items we see that older champions become severely broken with bizarre builds and potential ways of playing them or they just become outright useless (Ie. Old Karma). The game is regularly updated but there are still several key issues that need addressing and it seems like they are negating the quality of life changes within the game simply to push out more 'new' profitable content. Furthermore I feel that the games community is the worst I have ever seen and makes the CoD community look like a bunch of flower-sniffing hippies simply for the fact you get some really nasty abuse even before the game starts you get people who go AFK and you get people who feed and troll and it's really an unpleasant experience.In conclusion League of Legends is a game that really requires a lot of practice and patience and the ability to deal with people who could be toxic  follow those rules and you will have a decent time. PS: NERF IRELIA.,4,I have a lot of questions around this game. Why people loves as much as they love this game? What´s new in this game?

The only way to get a better character than the crap selection they give you for free is to either play like crazy to earn free points to spend money on better champs... this takes forever. The other way is to pay with actual money. What a load of crap. AVOID.,0,Poorly balanced old graphics rather boring toxic community and developers who don't care about the game but rather about just making as much money as possible on it. Avoid at all costs. Play Dota 2 or any other Moba.,0,Awful game. Repetitive gameplay totally unbalanced champions only one real map. I know people are saying this game is funny with friend but they should probably play better game which are funniest like Awesomenauts. The "Hardcore gamers" shoulden't loose their time on this and probably should go play Dota 2,0,Worst game ever.The game itself is fun but the client crashes nerfing of champions terrible ranked system horrible xp/.ip earning bad community static gameplay and terrible support means that you should avoid this. And the worst thing of course is Riot itself which should get an award for the worst company.,2,funny at first but quickly becomes bad because of updates up and nerf poor community  in 2013 it is still a beta game.Be care it's a Pay 2 Win not F2P ^^,0,I can recommend you this game with my whole heart if you are below the gae of 12 and are looking for cartoon-ish characters to spend your time. The community is horrible from what I can tell. I managed to play 100 games with a thick skin but I cannot take it anymore.,0,Try something else. The champions are pretty boring and flat as well the game itself. The community is one of the worst honestly full of ragers and flamers everywhere.,0,Was fun within the first few games but then it leveled out became boring so quickly. You can only use a few of the characters and they all change every week  and if you want to keep using one you got  to BUY it with either IP awarded from playing or using real money to buy them. To me that is a huge turn-off and it is definitely not "free",0,A masterpiece of horrible graphics server problems and a community that doesn't deserve this name at all. Flamers/hater seem to be allowed to shout out bullsh*t all the time and nobody cares...,0,Israfzaman kaybicoppara tuzagi daha aciklamama gerek kalmadi.Cok kotu arkadaslar hic zamaninizi bosa harcamayin yani uzulursunuz ilerde bosa giden zamanlariniza.,3,This game is pretty fun when you start playing.

However after a handful of games faulty game mechanics begin to surface making more and more games very one-sided. The matchmaking system is based on a so called 'ELO-rating' which should be an indicator of 'how good you are'. However this system is only based on games won and games lost. I can safely say that 15 out of 20 games are one-sided slaughterfests where one team completely dominates the other team (ie. the one team has at least 4 times more kills then the other leaving that team overfed and the losing team has almost 0% chance to come back from it). Furthermore if you do get a 'fair' matchup based on the average ELO of your team and the opposing team you will still be pitted against teams who have way more wins on average than you have. This means that if the matchmaking system finally puts you against people with around the same ELO you can still lose pretty badly because the other team simply has more games played and thus way more experience with the game. I have been playing this game for 2 years now and it seems like the broken matchmaking system only gets worse. Currently Riot has never acknowledged this problem even with countless treads about this subject on their forums so it does not look like this problem will be solved anytime soon. I could recommend playing this game for the first 10-20 levels of experience but I will strongly advise everyone to not invest any money in this at all (or at least until this major problem is being dealt with). If you want to keep having fun during the first 10-20 levels you can make new accounts.,5,The good thing about this Defense of the Ancients based game is that it is newbie friendly compared the other DotA spin-offs. But for the "Defense of the Ancients elite" it has little to offer in terms of balance depth and general skill. For me it's a different version of DotA based on action and killing rather than teamwork and strategy.,3,Unbearably convoluted and poorly structured this game has absolutely no player balance and suffers from multiple glitches. A few prime examples of this abhorrent failure would be: When you cast something at a mob (because you literally have to farm pve mobs really?) the turret will kill what you've already casted towards negating your cast and placing it on cooldown (GREAT JOB).

Avoid it.,2,League of Legends is the perfect embodiment of everything that is wrong with gaming.

The original developers in one of the most underhanded abuses in gaming history stole large amounts of information and ideas from the original DotA community and developers. Forming “Riot Games" they continued to make their own "casual" version of DotA with the intention of gaining as many casual players as possible and then extorting them monetarily. Riot is known for doing things like: - Releasing very strong champions which entices people to buy them and then nerfing them a week later. - Releasing skins for champions that overpowered only to nerf them after the first week or two of the new skins coming out (kayle udyr etc) - Releasing new champions instead of fixing ones they have already released. They have been doing better recently but at one point they were releasing champions every other week and completely ignoring the community. Speaking of community League of Legends has quite possibly the worst community of any game ever. The amount of "circle jerk" that goes on within the community is completely embarrassing. Riot basically turns a blind eye to the large problem they face and instead do things like tell people to not be mad at each other. Most actual legitimate requests to help make the game better are shunned by the community. If you go on the forums and post actual constructive talking points you will be showered in downvotes. If you go on the forums and post a picture of a female champion in a playboy suit you will gain thousands of upvotes. League of Legends is also one of the worst designed game from a software perspective. I am a software developer by profession and it constantly blows my mind how poorly designed this game is. There is countless design decisions which make no sense. Using Adobe Air was possibly the biggest blunder any "professional" gaming company has made in the last decade. The client constantly crashes disconnects and lags out. The game also looks pretty terrible but that is something I don't mind much since I am usually more about the actual gameplay and performance of the engine. Riot as a developer are already pretty crappy just based on how they run their game but they are even worse than they appear. Doing things like bribing professional gaming circuits to only play their game in the Dota-like category. Many of the higher-ups in the company are extremely stuck up thieves who made millions stealing other peoples ideas and constantly post unprofessional and stupid things to the forums. If you are thinking about playing League of Legends do yourself a favor and play Dota 2 instead. Dota 2 does everything that LoL did wrong right.,0,basically a  game bad game playbad graphcis evil developers and a comunity full of 12 age kids its a game pay2win because you must use money to get the good heroes,0,Outstanding Potential but then the line of success was broken by the community. Everything is the communities' fault as well as unbalanced teams and not to mention why should you have to win so many matches to rank up? That's like if you were on a tightrope from France to New York I'm DEAD serious. RIP,1,Low quality graphics and unbalanced heroes are the immediately apparent shortfalls of this game. Then comes the limited hero roster and grinding that is required to unlock the full game. Another unappealing aspect is that you can use real life money to grant your hero buffs which means a game can start off unfair.,3,Great game but the community destroys it... with no working punishment systems in place players troll as a sport ruining the game for any and all. Does not welcome new players whatsoever. Extremely hateful player base.,0,its a pay to win game that has no thought on having any learning curve that rewords players who spend time on the game and not all the people are free witch messes up the flow win a new broken person comes out and the people who don't spend money ion the person get screwed over.,4,A bunch of amateurs once created this fun moba game.

The only thing that changed is the amount of skins and champions. Instead of adding variety to the game they removed it. They also removed solo-queue recently and replaced it with that new game mode called "carry or get carried by the eloboosters" where you can queue up with your friends and increase your personal elo rating (notice how queuing with friends = personal rating o.0). Furthermore the community in this game has the mental capacity of a 5 year old. If somebody bullies us we tell the teacher. Obviously Riot has taken advantage of that situation and permabans accounts at the drop of a hat. This benefits both the 5 year olds (who are happy the bully got banned) and obviously Riot (who is basically scamming their customers taking away what they paid for). But the community is so overwhelmed by the hatred for their fellow co-players that they don't realize they're acting like sheep. Overall a great atmosphere. I give this game a 4 but honestly as a veteran player and gamer I'm really disappointed by Riot Games as I am by most North American publishers lately. Too greedy. My suggestion would be to actually play the game but NEVER spend any money. Also do not take it very seriously especially while playing ranked.,0,Worst free 2 play implementations of any of the mobas. You will never be able to afford more than a color swap for a single champion unless you buy skins for the ridiculous price of about 10$ each. Some of them cost as much as 20$.

Now that does not mean that LoL is a bad game it just means that I think that Dota mechanics make more sense. League offers a larger community of players with a gameplay based almost entirely on items. Abilities of the player are made stronger only through the items that are bought and hardly at all through leveling. The rune system is pretty much pointless until the player reaches level 20 and can purchase the Tier 3s but even then they will have played against people with an advantage due to their runes and masteries. Plus the player has to either earn enough IP to unlock champions or purchase RP to unlock them. In Dota all of the champs come free to play and the only items that the player purchases with real money are character sets. In game the character scales based off of leveling. Also something that League has just gotten around to adding; Dota has had an in-game voice chat since the release and if someone is being toxic there is a mute button for chat and in-game text chat. There are no runes or masteries that give seasoned players any advantage over newcomers and the game is based more on skill than it is dependent on runes and masteries. Overall League has a larger player base but Dota has superior gameplay opportunity.,6,One thing I like about the League is that it has a clear fluid gameplay unlike some of the other MOBA I've tried. It's nothing special but good enough to kill some time.,10,This is a game that really deserves perfect score.

Overall I found my new multiplayer love like Quake games years ago.,9,I'm playing this game for 4 years now starting early season 1 and all I can say is that this is an amazing game with a horrible community but all you have to do is to find 4 friends to play and mute the other team and this is certainly my most important pvp experience I ever found in an online game.,0,Horrible community.

For example most characters aren't well balanced. For example ranged characters are almost as strong as melee ones in damage which is pretty annoying already in the beginning. The price of the characters not even resembles their effectiveness and I bet that's what most would think at first. Gold farming can be quietThis game is pretty good but there are many negative sides in it for me. For example most characters aren't well balanced. For example ranged characters are almost as strong as melee ones in damage which is pretty annoying already in the beginning. The price of the characters not even resembles their effectiveness and I bet that's what most would think at first. Gold farming can be quiet annoying because the last hitter gets the most gold and kill as well and these just makes everyone steal the kills which just makes people hate each other in the game. Aside from these the game requires quiet a lot of teamwork and even if only one person is not cooperating the game is most likely lost. Now the good side of the game is there's a function to play with bots (And it's pretty well made up) which can be played with only bots (Beginner only) or with people (Beginner and intermediate). There are runes in the game which seems useless at first look but they can be quiet a big difference maker in early game (But this most likely happens only after level 20 when you can buy the best runes). They boost your champion's stats and you can purchase more of these while you level up. There are also masteries which boosts your stats as well but not as much as the runes. The other good thing I found in this game is that you can buy all the champions without giving a cent into the game. The only things that cost real-life money is skins IP/EXP boosts and such. So I would rate this game 5/10.,0,Only thing good about this game is it's free and you don't have anything to waste except time (loading between games succeeds at that).

This mostly applies to the Summoner's Rift map but when you are at champion select 90% of the time users rage at your champion choice and you have to fulfill a specific role similar to a group in an mmo. If you are not fast at your pick you are most likely stuck with the role that you do not want or there will be multiples of the same role usually mid bot ad ranged or top. I think they need to add more support and jungle heroes or change the style of the roles to make them not just be the gank slave (jungle) or the ward slave (support). Some of the weakest graphics of this game type and its age and f2p category. Movement and attacks feel sluggish at times interface is rather huge clunky and only minimal  customization available (scaling frames only).,1,Friends got me into League but it's so bad I've been actively trying to convince them to stop playing.

Then when you do get in a game it's actually not very fun.,0,This is definitely one of the worst games i have ever played.

The balancing is ridiculously bad and the Champions and abilities are unoriginal and some of them are clearly copies (Vayne for example). The gameplay is pretty boring and unrewarding the community are all raging kids that will report youThis is definitely one of the worst games i have ever played.

The balancing is ridiculously bad and the Champions and abilities are unoriginal and some of them are clearly copies (Vayne for example). The gameplay is pretty boring and unrewarding the community are all raging kids that will report you for anything and worst of all a single death and your opponent will be so much stronger than you that they'll have to make a huge mistake to lose. So overall this is a horrible game and i would recommend anyone to avoid it.,3,This game has some serious problems. Heroes are completely unbalanced due to the fact that new heroes are usually overpowered so they can sell them faster. Then they nerf them when a new hero comes available. Game mechanics are pretty boring you can only have one play style (1 tank or off-tank top 1 mage middle 1 carry and 1 support bottom and 1 jungle) don't even bother tryingThis game has some serious problems.

Game mechanics are pretty boring you can only have one play style (1 tank or off-tank top 1 mage middle 1 carry and 1 support bottom and 1 jungle) don't even bother trying something different as you will only get people laughing at you. It is the same for hero builds if you not play with exactly the same builds shown in popular guides people will blame you for everything. Early game and mid game is fun but when you get to level 30 the fun stops. The LoL community is one of the worst I've ever seen. Don't matter if you are good or bad if you win or you lose there are people who won't stop complaining even before the match starts.,4,If you are a fan of this new so called MOBA game genre then perhaps you alright with this game but for everyone else keep away from those kind of games since are completely broken in matter of game balance and game mechanics also totally brainless in matter of progression  the one that taking the last hit is rewarded with almost all the money of the kill even if you were there and did allIf you are a fan of this new so called MOBA game genre then perhaps you alright with this game but for everyone else keep away from those kind of games since are completely broken in matter of game balance and game mechanics also totally brainless in matter of progression  the one that taking the last hit is rewarded with almost all the money of the kill even if you were there and did all the job).And of course since this game has the "free to play" tag it has a community of kids and nerds that they are enjoying to be rude and leaving or going afk in almost every single game.However this game is fun if you are playing with friends in any other situation this is a stupid game that has one map (actually it has 3 but there is no interest in the other 2) that people playing it repeatably all the time.,1,Just another DotA rip-off some stuff changes but the core gameplay is still the same. The only merit of this game is it's huge playerbase; being highly casual it's easy to start playing which in turn attracts the masses who never played a DotA game before and don't care about the childish graphics and poor game mechanics. I must thank Riot though for taking the children away from Dota 2.,3,League of legends is probably one of the more addictive free-to-play games out there. The premise is you and 4 other players face off against 5 other players/bots the first team to destroy the enemy nexus wins. Simple right? Well if you intend on playing with players you're in for a rude awakening.

Well if you intend on playing with players you're in for a rude awakening. League of Legends is plagued by quite possibly the most repulsive creatures of human society. In a strictly team-oriented game the possibility of one of your members being either a troll or an obnoxious 12 yearold who has caps-lock perpetually on is staggeringly high. Any merits this game may have is offset completely by the quality of it's community and there seems to have been little to no effort to fixing it. This game was amazing in beta and shortly after since then it's spiraled down the drain. Top this off with developers that lie(They pride themselves on being transluscent but I've witnessed first hand them deleting an entire slew of red posts(red=riot staff the developers) to cover up things that would ignite their playerbase. I would under any other circumstance give this game a 9 or 10 but you will not believe how badly the community actually influences this game and I don't think I can properly express it in words as to why this game earned a 3 instead of a solid 10. You'd have to pick it up and play for a few weeks to understand just how impossible it is to play a team-centric game like LoL with the players it has.,0,This game is flat out awful. It's imbalanced has horribly graphics frequent lag and server downtime and the developers don't seem to care about their game in general. Stay well clear of this one.,0,It's basically "baby's first moba" it takes really no skill to play and it's just an all around casual-fest for players with less skill but want to pretend they're good by playing any number of riot's broken champions. It's a really bad game it's only fun if you're completely new to the moba scene and have no idea what you're doing. If you lack skill in spades this is the game to play.,0,Dota 2 is much competitve and fun to play .Tough to learn but better than this  Honestly its horrible and awful. Imbalanced and that runes and stuff with real money makes you stronger  Thats just pay to win.,2,A cheap 3D remake of Pokemon from GameBoy Color. No actual skill required for playing just choose the strongest hero. There are many games in this genre that are much better. Have seen worse games though.,0,Stupid game circles map.Abominable press play.This seems to mimic the characters somewhere.Riot foam company that came up overnight.Game industry's disaster.,0,A pay to win oriented game as runes give so much more early game advantage not to mention the expanded champion pool. And plainly the anti-competitive attitude by the developer makes me sick.,0,This game is the most overrated and boring game I've ever played. Ever. The graphics are ugly and generic as **** there are so many keys to memorize the character names and appearances are absolute ripoffs of characters from other games (i.e. Garen sounds like Ganondorf and looks like him too except Ganondorf doesn't have as much armor) the characters are unbalanced and the patches areThis game is the most overrated and boring game I've ever played.

It's hard to believe that over 30 million people play this game! Why? Why do people play this piece of **** I don't know. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game at all costs.,0,Bad Free to Play Model;Bad Rune system makes you need to play for months before you can go to Ranked games;Bad Community;TOTALLY imbalanced...Riot is one of the WORSE...Just go to Dota 2 and Valve...,2,What started out pretty well has become a cluster f of a business model.  Their model is to pump out a new toon every two week.  It's how they make money but it's also how they keep the game in a perpetual state of imbalance.  They're now up to 115 (01AUG13) each with at least 5 traits/skills.  That's over 600 skills to memorize to keep up with their flawed business model. DOTA2 reliesWhat started out pretty well has become a cluster f of a business model.

LoL sells skins but apparently that wasn't enough so the flood their own market with mediocre toons. Their maps are stagnant and new games modes are rare (where's dm ffs?) Then there's the weak community.  Half the players will spite their own team.  If someone harrasses you and you speak your mind in return expect a "report".  Since this happens every game and there's no oversight of what leads to "reports" expect regular bans unless you don't ever want to chat during the game (and even that won't help sometimes). Check out DOTA2.  It's a solid game with years of history and balance and a more mature community.  It's got a higher learning curve but it's well worth it.,1,One of the worst notable MOBAs available while at the same time clearly because of dark magics and Riot sacrificing the souls of its employees to Satan the most popular one. Why is it popular? Well because it's simple. It's actually absolute faceroll up to high platinum some games feel like you're playing with bots. Now maybe I should start out by pointing out the positives aboutOne of the worst notable MOBAs available while at the same time clearly because of dark magics and Riot sacrificing the souls of its employees to Satan the most popular one. Why is it popular? Well because it's simple. It's actually absolute faceroll up to high platinum some games feel like you're playing with bots. Now maybe I should start out by pointing out the positives about LoL? OK so this game is fun... if you're playing with friends. Except there are hundreds of games that are way more fun with friends. This argument is completely irrelevant if a game is not fun without friends then it's just not fun so when someone tells you "LoL is fun when you're playing with friends" you can tell them just that. Every game is fun with friends. LoL is the epitome of an anti-fun game. The community is by far the worst community that was and ever will be not even elitistjerks.com had scumbags the likes you meet in every LoL match. So that's about the only positive I can think of regarding LoL. Now the negatives. Oh boy. I think I'd have to write that review for 2 hours just to get this right. The servers are absolute mess. For 2 years now EU players are waiting for DECENT (not even perfect just DECENT) servers. Back when I played EU West had queues almost every day and there were regular lagfests twice a week was pretty much a minimum. Riot is a multi-billion dollar company and it's unable (or rather unwilling) to deliver EU players proper servers. Balance. Or rather - lack of balance. There are a few champions that are broken by design and countless nerfs just can't fix them. There are dozens of champions that are underpowered and as such are never ever picked in competitive scene. Compare that to DOTA2 where pretty much every character is very much playable in competitive scene and you'll get the picture. There are also champions that are inherently OP and can do twice as much as the UP ones with half the effort. And then instead of trying to balance the game Riot is busy adding more champions that only ruin the game ever further. The client. Oh god the client. Such a terrible piece of **** It's laggy often unresponsive clunky and... Damn words can't express how bad the LoL client is. The community. Oh wait I talked about that already. Just let me say again LoL's community is the gutter of PC players' pool. During my whole 8 years in WoW I have not met as many antipathic toxic immature despicable and mentally unstable human beings as I have in a week in LoL (I played LoL for over 2 years so you can get the picture). And then WoW community isn't exactly known for being social polite and helpful neither. The game is P2W. It is literally IMPOSSIBLE to farm up for everything you need to start playing ranked games. It just can't be done. A year or so ago I've read a chart that explained how long you'd have to play to get all champions and runes in game. It was over a year worth of time. A year of your life. You'd have to work full time for 3 years to unlock everything without buying RP. If you don't have runes and most champions you are at a disadvantage in competitive play. This is pure P2W. Oh well I don't have time not space to write much more so I'll leave it all at that. Stay away from this game it's simply not worth the time and nerves.,0,Horrible gameheroes are mostly bad copies of dotaand arenÂ´t even close to being unique. Hon+dota all the way! I don't recommend this game to anyoneexpect if you're looking for a way to waste your time and get depressed at the same time.,0,Crappy DOTA copy. Oversimplified game play. Limited hero pool and selling heroes unlike in DOTA where they always been free. Balance is not existent due to releasing new heroes few weeks just to make tons of money.

Like CoD the graphics in this game are outdated the text that pops up every time you last-hit a minion looks like its a font from Microsoft Word.

The childish fans of this game seem to think it has a GIANT learning curve however you can play one match and you've already learnt everything you need to know simple as that. The pay to win system is terrible as well many fans may argue that all champions are "balanced". This statement is absolutely false as Riot and one of the most money-grubbing companies I have encountered as a gamer. They have to use incentives to make you want to buy those champions whether it be better skills or overall better feel or look. Seriously this game is a joke if anything. I reckon that DotA 2 NEEDS to take this games place.,1,Terrible community which you eventually become a part of.Masks itself as free-to-play when the average player has spent more on it than a regular "full-cost" gameServers are very unstable and often go down on a regular basis.

Every champ has their up and downs.Well here come the down sites:-Graphics are too comic like. At this point I prefer the current DotA 2-A LOOOOOT of flaming kiddies (like in CoD) that will desttroy your fan at the game.-Many experienced players create new accounts for 'pwning noobs' which makes it a little bit hard for newcomers to get into the game.-Bad reconnect system (if you have a broken connection like me)-Too many changes in a short period(in the last 6 months almost every champion/item/mode has been changed) which also makes unbalance the game even more.-Elo system for ranked matches in the leaderboard system (you are a good player and always get bad teams....then you are stuck in elo hell like me)So overall i really like this game and play it a lot.It qualities are not visible in the first view.You should at least try it for some matches out because its a free 2 play title.,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        This is the only game I'm genuinely rating flat out 0 It's a horribly unbalanced The best champions are pay2win you get 40 point's if you lose 400 if you win This game is Unfair ugly and a terrible throw off to dota. If you like lol you  will LOVE dota 2 because it's 100x better Screw this game screw it's community and screw the lazy developers. NOT worth playing the amount of time you'l spend just trying to learn how to play the game will be wasted when you actually start playing a bunch of second accounted players who will rip your team to shreds. This game stinks.,0,This is one of the worst games I have ever played. Can't believe that so many people waste their time on this crap. Especially with so many wonderful games available.,7,This game is enjoyable but as it stands now I will not buy it as a retail product because one map simply isn't enough the "worldmap" of the realm where League of Legends takes place has ~13 maps yet there's only one available. I will stay with the free version for now.

Presentationwise this game delivers solid for a title that's free. That aside: The gameplay is amazingly fun and the differences between the champions are something you need to explore before getting really good in the game. Do not be mistaken by it being your average RTS as Riot calls it it's a MOBA a hybrid between RTS and RPG if that still doesn't ring a bell compare it to a little WC3 mod called DOTA. It's a rough diamond one that has potential in my opinion.,2,Really dumb game. I can't believe its so popular. You hardly do anything at all its incredibly simple and uncomplicated. Its like an arcade game for kids 5 and under.,1,Terrible community no sense of balance and it's nothing but another example of "pay to win" philosophy. Don't waste your time.

Too bad the developers decided it's fine to leave it alone and let players deal with it,1,League of Legends is quite a funny game but there are better games in its genre. Also their F2P system is quite horrible... It's true that it not a Pay2Win system but still they should let you play all the heroes from the beginning.

I think that originality is very important to review.,0,This game used to be fun and innovative. That was years ago. Since then the game has devolved into pure trash. Every shred of potential has been completely and utterly squandered.,4,This game is great. I love the teamwork part in it when you play with Real life friends and that you actually have to get to know every champion in order to be successful. And also the fact that you can kind of personalize your champions with a skin that makes you happy about it. THE BIG PROBLEM: The community.

The community is so rotten and full of cwap that i seriously think about finding something else to put my money in. It's full of children who are not socially mature so they will tell you off no matter if you are right or they are wrong. SUPER ROTTEN Riot DO SOMETHING. I'm writing in capital because it is their main problem and they really need to do something about it. If you try it get ready for a time consuming game you need to reach lvl 30 which is quiete a bit of work and you need to read guides and stuff about masteries and runes which amplifies your role in the game. This is a game where you need to be skilled to have some fun. Otherwise the community will eat you and spit you out without a single emotion. 4 out of 10 because the game is destroyed and nearly unplayable with that community. You log on happy and log off somewhat mentally down.,4,It's a fun and challenging game. But however this comes in price. Like DotA the game that have given roots for League of Legends it's competitive Player vs. Player hero-based battleground.Pros:-It's fun with friends-Easy to get into the game and play-A lot of champions to choose from-No game-breaking in-game shop (not Pay-to-Win)Cons:-Community-Even in normal matchesIt's a fun and challenging game.

So this review will be free of bias. Now let's get started. At first the game is a blast and holds so much fun. But it loses appeal far too quickly there is so little to this game. You get a certain amount of champions every week and there almost always the same. Further more the only way to unlock those champions is byFirst off I would like to say I am not a fan of Dota or Dota 2. So this review will be free of bias. Now let's get started. At first the game is a blast and holds so much fun. But it loses appeal far too quickly there is so little to this game. You get a certain amount of champions every week and there almost always the same. Further more the only way to unlock those champions is by buying them with either Riot Points or Influence Points. Riot Points cost REAL money and are rather expensive. It take like 10 dollars for nearly everything. Than obtaining IP is time consuming and everything that you can buy with IP are champions and runes. Runes are cool of course but you rarely every see their use in game. Masteries are also like this cool but useless. But by far the worst thing about LoL is the community. There are kind people out there but your chances of finding them are 1/1000. The LoL community is either rude or disgusting. I mean there are some of the worst and gross names out there. Of course you can report them but NOTHING ever happens to them. Even though you don't have access to all champions you don't wanna unlock most of them. There is a huge lack of balancing in LoL and when new champions are released they are completely over powered. Now don't get me wrong LoL is a good game it's just not one that will keep you interested mainly because you will really only ever play 5v5 which always has the same plan. One solo character goes top one guy who jungles a support and a carry go bottom and than an op champion goes middle. That's about it there is no in-depth strategy or cool champions. Because when you find a champion that plays to your strengths he gets nerfed for no reason and becomes useless to you. But it gets worse EVERY SINGLE NEW champions is an old champion with new skills that makes him/her slightly different. This MOBA does little to change anything for the MOBA genre. So even though I loved this game and spent forever on it I am in the end required to give it a 5/10. It's free so you can try it just don't sucked in spend money. Because it really isn't worth it.,8,The game itself is great the wide variety of Champions one can play as is great. A lot of it comes down to skill and sportsmanship. If your team is good and the enemy team is good and everybody is being for the most part courteous to each other it is simply one of the funnest exhilarating games one can play. The graphics aren't the top of the line perfect for not exactly high end butThe game itself is great the wide variety of Champions one can play as is great. A lot of it comes down to skill and sportsmanship. If your team is good and the enemy team is good and everybody is being for the most part courteous to each other it is simply one of the funnest exhilarating games one can play. The graphics aren't the top of the line perfect for not exactly high end but close computers running everything at max. The gameplay can start out slow but will develope into a great strategic slaughter fest that can go any which way. The last hit almost always carries the most weight in their game modes but as long as you're at the least getting champion assists and minion kills you won't be horribly unequipped. The devs and staff seem to care about the fans turning ideas into in game realities from Characters to skins and even to the way the entire game works inside and out of the battlefield. Overall I enjoy the game as well as many other people do I believe that there's a champion for everyone.,10,This game deserves at least an 8/10. The user score is so low because when the game came out it wasn't the best game but now the quality is very good. The game is more balanced than it used to be and riot has made league of legends into a beast. I am giving 10/10 to bump the user score but the game is nowhere near perfect.,10,This game is awesome. Really competitive game Very very thrilling you are always learning new mechanics. The game is full of updates lots of details in the events new characters etc... Best MOBA I've ever played.,10,awesome made game...nice graphics and not too much requirements i give 10 because i like it DOTA is nothing compared with this so i recomend this in order  to enjoy playing some MOBA games,9,It seems that most of the commenters are haters and i can understand that.

But hey that's just my opinion. Nonetheless League of Legends gets better and better and i just can't wait for the updates. While in the beginning LOL had crappy graphics imbalanced champs and lots of bugs today it is the best MOBA you can have.

You try to play this game right better and that's the purpose of it. Winning a game is something but putting out some great moves learning your character or even failing is really fun. You can say the same for probably all moba games but what makes League that good is its simplicity and the versatility of the game. Every character has a different mechanics playstyles and actually creative ways of using spells unlike dota (sorry Russians). This game will never get repetitive. New champions playstyles builds... and new people new flamers kids sociopaths etc. ****ing your life since 2010.,9,League is the best free to play MOBA out there. Developer Riot continues to patch upgrade and surprise their players. A lot of game modes and a constant flow of new characters and skins make this a game to be played for years to come.,4,I played this game for relatively short period since it's attraction rapidly diminished within single month. The major positive point is definitely marketing strategy - it's free to play.

Graphics and music are sound game style reminds me Warcraft quest missions - storm turrets duel against enemy's champions advance towards opponent's base. Resources are simplified to gold while champion's are able to spend that gold for different items I'm sure that sounds familiar to most of gamers.Now let's review pros and cons of this particular game -Pros :1) Good quality of art2) Simple control ( 4 major skills are correlate to QWER buttons )3) Simple & attractive concept4) Broad range of different champions to choose fromCons :1) Game client is unstable especially for Mac game often freezes crashes2) Network protocol is chatty  lags due bandwidth limitations are happens3) Free to play concept has a tricky part e.g. powerful champions would cost you real money4) Champions are unbalanced some champion's skills dubious e.g. allows exploits/abuses5) Some players exhibits hostile behaviour however game engine does not utilize any means of protection against that. For example players could deprive each other of resources since game does not reward according to efforts e.g. the person who made last blow to monster enemy champion tower etc receives rewards instead of sharing proportional to total damage.6) Many skills are created specially to give advantage to AI bots e.g. 1 second shield which restores mana upon being broken by enemy spell etc.In general game is really shallow which is unfortunately provides a huge boost to it's popularity - if you are searching for a long term game this game is probably a bad choice. If you want to enjoy this game do not hesitate to spent at least 100 dollars for Riot points and do not start from champions with difficulty higher than six :),5,League of Legends is an okay-ish RTS game especially for those new in the genre. It's just that there ain't too much of a difference between characters play styles effects buffs skills and whatnot. I find it having a significant lack of "variety" between its game play elements.,1,The players have mental issues honestly in this game everyone is the enemy you find yourself hating your teammates and hating the enemy.

I rather play on a server where an experienced player is given admin and can ban people for days for acting the way they do... like in the good old CS days... shame people only act civilized when they are under a threat...,9,The most popular MOBA of all time hell most popular game of all time. Does it live up to its name? You bet it does. LoL does a lot of things right and several things wrong. Firstly it's popular and has a lot of content and on top of that it's free to play. It is accessible and has a reasonable business model which encourages a lot of gameplay for the player.The game nowThe most popular MOBA of all time hell most popular game of all time. Does it live up to its name? You bet it does. LoL does a lot of things right and several things wrong. Firstly it's popular and has a lot of content and on top of that it's free to play. It is accessible and has a reasonable business model which encourages a lot of gameplay for the player. The game now features over 115 heroes that can be customized with mastery "talent" trees and "runes" which let you empower your hero in different ways. The complexity of the game is just perfect for both casual and competitive players although most HoN and DOTA players would disagree and bash the game for being "too casual". But in my opinion Riot really did remove the features that seemed to hinder the fun aspect of MOBA games (eg. denying your creeps). The game also features unique hero and environment designs accompanied by great user interface. The learning curve is still there and the lack of a good tutorial and explanation of basic gameplay concepts. Also the client that the pre-game lobby runs on is old and buggy and can really get on the nerves of some people. I quit LoL a year ago as I have over 1500 hours clocked on it and it got quite boring and repetitve and it didn't help that Riot is scared of any major balance changes and if they do them they nerf instead of buffing which gradually makes the game sillier and more boring to play in my opinion. In my opinion LoL is the best "all-round" MOBA experience featuring complex gameplay and strategies without flooding the player with mechanics that hinder the core fun MOBA experience. The lack of tutorial and good lobby client is definitely a con until it's fixed.,6,Another DotA with expanded and...dulled gameplay.

This game takes a lot of team work and skill to win your games and trust me you won't play "quick" League games because LoL sessions can range anywhere from 15-90 mins averaging at about 30 to 40 minutes a game. This is a very fun game to get into because many people play it and it is very rewarding when you and your team mates destroy all of the Enemies' defenses. The one thing about this game that bothered was the community. This game has the worst community ever. I am not joking. League has one of the WORST communities in a videogame. You will run into every single thing you hate about a Multiplayer community ranging from the Troll to the Elitist of LoL players,8,The Game itself is great but the Community deserves a 0. The Players are obviously also part of the Game and its not fun in 90% of your Games if you get flamed insulted bullied and humiliated.

Each champions mechanics feel unique to them and it would be a great experience if it was possible to integrate something to allow the users the ability to never have to hear what anyone has to say besides in game instructions or something like that.,4,It is a solid game but is really overrated. Unfortunately it has the worst community of online games I have ever seen which really drags the game down. Overall its fun for a free product but it gets repetitive after a while.,4,To say honestly Lol is really easy game with worst MOBA community. Graphic is old and don't fit me. People are vulgar and unfriendly. Pay to Win system ruins everything. 25% of champions are overpowered (and expensive) and 75% are weak. Altough game is playable and when you spend there a lot of money it will give you fun.,7,I started playing League of Legends about two years ago without knowing what to expect from it. A few friends of mine said it was good so I downloaded it and played a few games. I noticed something right in my first few games: The graphics are pretty bad for a current generation game. I don't really care about a game's graphics but League of Legends does looks pretty awful except forI started playing League of Legends about two years ago without knowing what to expect from it. A few friends of mine said it was good so I downloaded it and played a few games. I noticed something right in my first few games: The graphics are pretty bad for a current generation game. I don't really care about a game's graphics but League of Legends does looks pretty awful except for a few character's models and the reworked Twisted Treeline map. But don't get scared away from the graphics; League of Legends has one of the most addicting gameplays I have ever experienced. Getting started is always a bit slow in MOBAs and League of Legends is no exception but it is easier to learn than for example DOTA 2. What really helps new players is the good UI which makes it easy to find every option or item in the shop. Additionally you can change tons of options to make the game exactly fit your needs. The gameplay is extremely fast-paced and you will need quick reaction times to survive for long but that ability will come as your general skill advances. When playing PvP games data about your win rate and such will be used to find players who are as good as you which makes the early summoner levels easy for newer players. When reaching level 30 you can also play ranked games which will put you in a certain division depending on how many of the first ranked games you win. This makes the selection of enemies and teammates even better and is a pretty nice feature itself but sadly there are always people blocking your way to higher ranks. That brings me to one of the worst parts of League of Legends: The community.More than 60% of the people my friends and I met in this game are either flaming feeding kills going AFK or not communicating with the team. And afterwards it's always the fault of the people who did something useful. And if you think they would just get banned: They mostly don't because the punishment system in League of Legends is too friendly to bad behaving players. After two years of playing this game my ignore list is filled with more than 1.000 players and I have reported at least the same amount. Something else wrong with League of Legends is the game balance. Riot keeps releasing characters which isn't exactly a bad thing but this makes balancing the game even more difficult and right now I am wondering if they still even try to. Champ after champ gets reworked changed buffed and nerfed but there are always champs that are just way too strong for the skill you need to play them.Let's compare League of Legends to DOTA 2 here: In DOTA 2 the characters are all pretty damn strong but they ALL are so it's basically balanced. In League of Legends there are champs like Lulu Varus Xerath and Orianna which take some skill to play but when mastered are pretty strong. On the other hand there are champs like Jarvan IV Kha'Zix Vi Gankplank and Lee Sin (mostly melee champs somehow) which have a huge damage output no matter how good you are with them or generally at the game. The base damage of all champs is around the same amount but some champs just aren't difficult at all and therefore hit more abilities. I can only recommend this game to everyone who likes MOBAs or similiar game types but you need a lot of time and you have to get through a lot of sh*t to play this for long because of the missing game balance and the really bad community.,7,As an avid player of RTS games I enjoy League of Legends thoroughly.It has fluid game play in the sense that it offers relatively faster rhythm of game flow.

They love their game and are constantly improving it. The good:Good graphics great gameplay free easy to play with friends introduction of different modes and ideas.  LOL is just a must have The bad:  The community.  Not all of it. not all of them and RIOT is doing its best to deal with it but you can't beat nerd rage. AND it is better then DOTA 2 in MY opinion.  Try both though to make up your mind.  There is no rule saying people can't enjoy/play both.  But DOTA 2 isn't for me.  And people who say DOTA 2 is much more complex and that makes it better blah blah....ignore them.  I ffound DOTA 2 to be needlessly convoluted and in no way more complex.  LOL feels more polished)))),5,In its early days League of Legends was great. However that time has come and gone. the game has extreme balancing issues sub-par graphics poor character designs and the worst community I have seen in a game in a very long time. I would suggest avoiding this game as it has little to no shining qualities and would only appeal to long-time fans of the genre.,6,very very fun to play easy to pick up. that is if you don't come across anyone else. (wait you just might!). Almost everyone in this game is going to have a go at you for no reason and you might go ahead and do the same thing yourself.

That being said the gameplay is straightforward  right click to move your single character. last hit the minions destroy structures then the enemy nexus. (in that order) the game is easy to get used to and has many champions(characters) to get into. just avoid the toxicity of this community and you'll do aight.,7,This game is a lot of fun and addicting. I've spent many hours in it. Its hampered by a really crappy community and a terrible game client. For free however I can't complain. I bought some characters but haven't spent more than $20 I'd say. And for that price I definitely got my money's worth.,5,this game is OKAY in fact it's very average. LoL offers a nice playing experience and a whole variety of champions to play in-game as different roles but the issue starts here only half of the champions are the stronger more polished champions whilst the others just rot and are hardly played by players some of the champions are in serious need of a re-work and makeover.

Another issue is the lack or servers with each region comes are bad  laggy server that we have to live with waiting queues can go up to 30:00 mins just to log on and a full server results in huge lag issues and disconnections and guess what another half a  hour to wait to get back on and to try to re-join your team before the report you for leaving. Speaking of people the community comes to mind THE WORST EVER community is existence is to be found here gents it's very bad so bad it drags the game down with it toxic players who call you "noob" and words that would even upset london chaffs. the game also isn't very stable to get onto to it you have to get past a launcher a log-in window the game lobby area thing then the loading screen and then your in the game and most of the times players have reported crashes and failures happening at the loading screen and the bugs lead to disconnection and so on... once your get past the bugs picked support role (cause there was a fight for mid which resulted in you getting support) muted the kids and gotten into the game it's alright. An nice experience sometimes happen in this game with games sometimes lasting up to 60 mins and end up pretty intense it's really fun some learners may find it hard at first but it's still quite fun to play with 3 stages to a games there?s always this sense of strategy and ever changing gameplay however this game relies on teamwork a ton and because of the community...yeah doesn't work out.,4,Pros  Easy to play for newbie  especially young players constantly update every 2 weeks.Cons  Bad graphics Imbalance hero pool Bad community Too easy for veterans,7,Fun game but slightly spoiled by the communi. Even in non ranked games theres way top much pressure that when you get a bad match others will really make you feel like rubbish. I'd recommend playing with a group of friends though so you can enjoy the awesome game,8,I've read old reviews saying how crap this game is (graphics repetitiveness bad community etc) so here's an honest review with an honest rating from an average player. I have been playing  League since early Jan 2011.

I  hadn't played any Moba games previously which made it hard to pick up. Each week were new champions I hadn't played and it took awhile til I found a champion that I enjoyed. Champion Guides were what helped me each game and I basically played by them. I only really got into the game after hitting level 30 being able to have a full mastery and rune page. The community has become more positive (in-game at-least) and players communicate more in order to help their team. The normal matchmaking system is better (e.g 4 man premade of silver/gold vs 2 man premade of silver/gold with a plat player) and a-lot more depends on your teams attitude than the champion picks. There are over 100 champions to play all with unique and awesome skills. There are also 4 maps now all with various game-types to make the daily experience more enjoyable. All the visuals are updated and all the original/old champions are being redone to accompany the changes. There are loads of servers now too so the only restrictions are your internet or PC. If you've never played and want to give this game a go be warned it will not be easy. Play with a friend and aim to have fun each game. Learn from your mistakes listen to your teammates and communicate with them. Watch tournaments streamers and videos to give you ideas and improve your skills. You will get better the more games you play. Good luck and thanks for reading. (Also note a-lot of the old reviews are (obviously) outdated and don't apply to the game now. So don't be put off by them.),5,In the battle of DOTA2 v League of Legends  League of Legends wins my vote. The game looks nice runs great on a wide variety of machines.

HOWEVER... The community on this game is VERY bad and VERY abusive. Example you finish the tutorial go in a game against bots so it is just you 4 other humans vs team bots. These games a usually full of people who are claiming to be "top level" and basically just want to show off that they can try and win a game on their own getting a massive kill streak. They abuse new players offer no help and just constantly moan and complain. It gets even worst when you play in the real online matchmaking. If you played this game with 4 other friends constantly together on the same team it would be worthy of maybe a 9 or 10/10! but seriously go see for yourself how bad the abuse and community is.,8,Like many other popular games this game has too many fanboys and too many hatersits always being loved or hated for all the wrong reasons.One thing people complain about is the simplicity yes it is simpler then DotA no its not simple and being simpler then DotA doesn't make a game bad in any way.

LoL has complexity that is different to what DotA has that most people especially DotA players don't understand or don't want to understand while being simple enough for people who are new to the genre or don't have enough time to practice and learn something more complex and hardcore.LoL has a perfect imbalance but many players just don't get how it works so many will complain about OP champions too.Another thing people complain about is the way LoL does free to play but thats mostly idiots who think that free to play must be only done in the one way their favorite company does it or that f2p is evil and should be never done.The real problem LoL does have is its horrible community its better for more people theres a larger audience that keeps growing plus its a genre where team play and communication are important so obviously there will be lots of stupid people and you will meet some of them. But its not the worst community its not as bad as DotA for example.,5,The community for this game is terrible. I've played Modern Warfare and Black Ops all my life and never seen such horrible behavior in as long a chain of matches as this game. Sure you'll run across players that rant all the time in Call of Duty but League of Legends is horrible. Players constantly bickering and arguing against each other. Calling each other names. I love this game butThe community for this game is terrible. I've played Modern Warfare and Black Ops all my life and never seen such horrible behavior in as long a chain of matches as this game. Sure you'll run across players that rant all the time in Call of Duty but League of Legends is horrible. Players constantly bickering and arguing against each other. Calling each other names. I love this game but can't play it due to the community. Riot seems to favor particular champions as well in the League. Leblanc for instance had her silence removed but her damage and dodging is out of this world. It took Riot FOREVER to do something that seemed so obvious to change. Another example Darius used to be pretty outrageous. It took Riot a while to balance him because they were afraid of nerfing him into the ground. The problem here is that again they favor their champions and don't do this for someone like Skarner or Eve that were nerfed way too far into the ground and didn't see the light of day until recently. Oh did I mention that the servers are out of this world as well. I remember a time where the lag wasn't so bad and it was manageable. For me it was around the time of Varus's release and I enjoyed playing him because I could land all of his skill shots. I think about half a year to a year passed by and then it began to just dump and lag was inevitable about anywhere you played. This is probably around the time I switched to mid as my main because I could still play a champ with aoe abilities and have great burst to kill an opponent within those 5 stable seconds of ping. Now every time I watch my friends play I can't help but chuckle at their demise as they helplessly lag all over the screen. I enjoy a fresh cup of liquid refreshment kick back and just laugh at how terrible Riot's servers are and at how wise my decision was to stop playing this disaster. If you enjoy this game and can handle game I would recommend this game to you. If you are in the same boat as me get easily frustrated at lag despise a horrible community then I would highly suggest you don't play this game and avoid it.,3,This is a dumb person's Dota-clone. Made for kids by company that only cares about money.  It's a childish game made by childish people and will never be built in a good way.,0,Almost everything but the core gameplay is poor.  Riot is clearly milking this game for as much money as possible. Prepare for a toxic community and bugs galore.  This is a joke of a competitive game.,7,Good -Polished combat and mostly balanced champions.Not a pay-to-win but houses one of the best online markets I've ever seen for a free gameIt's freeBad -Terrible matchmaking discourages newbies from getting into LoL due to Riot's inability to control smurfing.

One of the most toxic player-to-player environments in-gaming. Trolls will thrive here.Lax punishments for leavers feeders and trolls. Riot adds a 'file a complaint' system that ends up being pushed under the rug. I know this because I still will go through 3 games in a row where one player is doing poorly and rage-quits = the entire game is ruined and then to top it all off teams are unable to surrender until 20 minutes in meaning if it's 1v5 too **** bad. Example from my last game - 3 of our teammates leave making it impossible to cover all lanes. We win the match though because somehow the entire opposing team had pings over 600 so they couldnt control their champtions. I wasn't sure whether to be mad or rejoice.,8,I've been playing this game since mid December and I've enjoyed it very much.

If you can survive that aspect of the game then you will find that it is actually quite fun. For a moba game its simple and user friendly the amount of content this game has is extremely high considering the developers seem to be adding and increasing champions etc… weekly. There are some balance issues but that goes with almost all online games. It is extremely competitive game and has little to no casual gameplay to it. Everyone thinks they are the best and if you don't match their standards they will let you know. Makes this game have one of the worst online communities out there. Gameplay: Simple Clean easy learning curve and free to play which means anyone can enjoy it. There really is no pay to win in this game as all champions can be unlocked with time. Online only game as there is no single player and the community is evil for the most part. Very few people are willing to help and considering this game is completely revolved around teamwork it makes for a hard environment to have fun. If you can manage to get a group of friends then this game can be a blast. Replay Value: High every match plays out differently. Tons of champions to play and choose from different team variations. Should keep you busy for as long as you are enjoying the game. Overall im mixed on this game game is fun and enjoyable to play with friends. Yet the community really ruins this game and makes for some impossible to win situations as trolls are plentiful.,5,I've been a fan of this game since I started playing back in 2011. It didn't take long though for me to to grow tired of the horribly toxic community. The game plays well the roster is nice but the community alone is more than enough to cause me not to play (unless I can get 4 friends). 4 friends playing? I'd throw it up to a 7 or 8. Playing solo? I'd rather chew aluminum foil.,7,Well. This game is really not bad. I playing in LOL by 2 years. Graphics - bad but for me not most important. What is mostly irritating - community.

On this map you join 4 other players to take down the enemy's Nexus (basically the heart of their base). The game has a wide variety of balanced characters(champions) to choose from each with individual skills and gameplay. Also before the match starts runes and masteries help you buff your champion at the beginning or progressively at the end of the game each game lasting approximately 20-45 minutes. However you need to unlock them one-by-one first. League is a free to play game with micro transactions however it is not pay-to-win.The graphics are decent although they will be upgraded in a short while. Also the game has numerous updates keeping the community entertained.Lastly it has an enormous competitive scene with countless of thrilling tournaments.This game can be tons of fun when played with friends in order to take down the enemy strategically and sometimes you can get a good laughter out of it. However after playing the game for a rather long time the gameplay becomes repetitive and rather boring. In addition to that you often get matched up with rude inconsiderate flamers (people who use indecent language during the game). This can become a tremendous problem when trying to reach a higher place in the ranking system of League of Legends therefore causing the game to be tense and not relaxing. It definitely requires patience and good morals to play the game which in my opinion very few people of the community have.,10,e-Sports can't be rated.

So that's normal if you don't find the mates of your dreams every game today. Furthermore League of Legends is a VIDEO GAME it's useless to take it too seriously you're not going to enjoy your time passed playing so you still can change your mind. (I'm talking for the majority of the people criticizing the game without getting their own opinion). About the content of the game I won't criticize the price of skins champions runes etc. Riot is a lucrative company. They're free to take the decision they want.If you are a normal player you're going to take several months maybe years to understand how League of Legends works. The classic MetaGame changes every year the "Op Champions" change almost every month too. It's almost impossible to get a perfect equality between every champions Riot is working on it. Indeed almost every week patches are realised to correct this gap. The maps we're playing in are re worked (principally the Summoner's Rift at the moment) the visual effects are not bad at all for a moba. I guess you understood my opinion. Even if the community of League of Legends is a vicious circle ("You're a typical league of legends player you don't respect the current meta in normal game your champion is useless report you") I'm sure that people will be able one day to think by themselves and that they'll realize that they play to a VIDEO GAME. To resume myself :- I'm sure ththe community will grow up-A lot of content  in game a bit repetitive but the community finds some ways to do different gameplay    (Teemo Ball Ultimate Bravery etc...).- A large pool of champions you can play which offers an strategic aspect to the game.- Connexion issues for many people (maybe hard to host more and more people everyday). That's all for my critic I probably forgot to mention many details it's not that easy to clearly explain yourself in English when you're French haha. So have fun everyone NunuDivertis  /   Capitaine Lama,8,League of Legends has been the most popular MOBA game for the past four or five years. I don't really need to praise it.It does have some issues. The main one being that new players don't have access to a large champion pool or runes that veterans might have.,7,Let's be honest part of the hate against the game seems to be backed by the fact that many do not know how to build their champions and misunderstand the basic dynamics of the game expecting a non MOBA experience. Hence the distaste towards the game. Its a decent at best good experience.,6,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        DRuins here with hopefully an insightful review.  League of Legends as we all know exploded onto the RTSMOBA scene in 2009 however I have to say I only played one game before I was completely turned off on the game once I realized there was no denying creeps.  Having said that I decided to give the game another go and try to keep my own self prejudices aside.  So here is what I have learned and have judged. League of Legends is an RTSMOBA based off the massive breakout of DoTA Allstars a mod in Warcraft: ROC and TFT.  Myself have been a fan of this game since it's original start in Starcraft as Aeon of Strife.  I went into this MOBA expecting them to follow the same format but with Riot Games own sort of flare.  However I was surprised to find that they deviated away from the original source material by a long ways.  I found that there was no longer any traditional lane control by denying your own creeps to prevent xp/gold gain to your lane opponents and there was this "pokemon" style brush where you or your enemies would disappear in as soon as stepping into it. Instead of following the original material they took an interesting spin on things.  They added additional sheets of runes and etc to enhance your champion in game.  You can place runes to increase your champions Ability Power Defense Magical Defense and Attack Power.  Granted never having experienced this before with any other MOBA of it's kind I found this both to be an added aspect to the game both good and bad.  Good being it immerses you deeper into the role you are trying to or have mastered and bad in the sense it gives a veteran player an upper edge to let's say one who has not had that many games in. In addition to the runes they also as previously mentioned taken away denying of your own creeps.  I have to say that I absolutely hated this part of the game given it left me feeling no sense of lane control.  No matter what I did I could no stop my opponent from gaining experience.  Unless I was to just go complete "Rambo" and push him out of lane expending both health and mana to do it.  I have to say this aspect of the game to me took so much skill out of it that I almost felt as though this was a casual version of my beloved DoTA. Other changes included would be the "secondary spells" as well as the free "tp" back to base.  These additional spells could be 2 of several ones.  To include health mana blink slow and etc.  I have to say I actually enjoyed playing around with the combinations to see which suited the champion I was playing.  The free "TP" back to base put me off a bit.  It eliminated the need for buying teleport scrolls which again makes it a bit casual. A big change also came in the form of no gold loss upon death.  This however nice it may be really left me feeling no punishment for messing up and dying.  Really didn't push me to try harder given I lost nothing for it.  Yet another casual feel to an already casually feeling game. A light however at the end of the tunnel.  With LoLs immense champion pool and seemingly endless combinations and variations you are constantly striving for the best team make up and strategy which I have to say is awesome.  Combined with LoLs humongous active player base you are never left sitting in Que for an eternity and with no stat recordings one or two bad games don't leave a red mark on your ledger LoL can be a nice break from the normal hardcore gaming. "THE VERDICT"  LoL is true to be a much more casual game compared to it's rivals DOTA 2 and Heroes of Newerth but I believe that to be both a good and bad thing and not just bad.  With it's more casual gameplay you find yourself not getting so upset by a death or defeat and can ultimately enjoy the game more.  However I have to say that if you are looking for a more skill based game and you enjoy the raging DOTA 2 and HoN might cleanse your pallet more but if you are one of the many who just enjoys playing a game or two simply because it is a game then LoL is definitely the choice for you. So given it's casual style compared to it's predecessor DoTA Allstars and not holding true to the skill based performance.  Including it's variety of champions spells runes and etc.  I have to give LoL a well deserved 6/10.,0,Dota 2 > LoLRussians > French................................................................................................................................................,10,The best most successful game in the MOBA genre.

That is very hard for any game to achieve.,9,I've been playing this game for 4 years now... and I've not killed myself like the negative reviews suggest so that's nice. Yes there are plenty of idiots who play this game and just abuse their team (who I mute if needed) or opposition (who I always have muted but as you play and improve you will rise above them and they will languish in the lower ranks.And that were this game isI've been playing this game for 4 years now... and I've not killed myself like the negative reviews suggest so that's nice. Yes there are plenty of idiots who play this game and just abuse their team (who I mute if needed) or opposition (who I always have muted but as you play and improve you will rise above them and they will languish in the lower ranks. And that were this game is brilliant playing improving and adapting and ultimately rising the ranks. I' lucky that I play with a couple of like minded people on a regular basis so I don't have to put up with random stuff as we all know the plan I'd recommend friending nice players and hooking up with them too. Personally I think the game is very well balanced they are always trying to make small adjustments as needed and yes sometimes this makes a character OP but you always have prematch bans to deal with this... or just learn how to shut them down. And new characters every month or so keeps it interesting and adds new dimensions. So I'd recommend trying it playing in a friendly way and muting those who don't. It takes a couple of games to understand the basic strategy and in my case 4 years or more to try and perfect yours! ;D,0,The game is unlike many things you will have played before and Churchill's quote concerning Russia applies well to the game "It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key".

Having spent 2 years with the game and having attended a professional league event I only know feel able to comment on the key to the game. The uniqueness of the game can easily enthral. However unlike a good thriller or mystery the key is nothing like you had hoped for and brutally strips you of much of the joy you felt about gaming. Without a shadow of a doubt the community is the most abusive and aggressive I have encountered anywhere by many nautical miles. The cause of this is Riot games give the appearance of earnestly tackling the problem whilst secretly abusing their own customers through warnings slow queues and bans for those with network disconnects. This goes well beyond the MMO distress of a disconnect during a crucial moment causing a team wipe. Specifically as the distress is magnified by Riot consciously punishing the victim. This sadistic nature at the heart of the firm is what drives rational people to be so foul to one another as to avoid the wrath of Riot they are driven to abuse their fellow players to enforce Riot's rules. The game is an excellent example of sociology and psychology utilised to turn a population into one of informants and oppressors. Once you strip away the layers to find the key you discover this not only to be true but that the game is a single level where you receive no benefit in return. There is no story satisfaction from winning or skill acquired. You play solely to avoid the wrath of Riot and the unwilling player base they manipulate to abuse one another. It is an abusive firm with an abusive player base which disguises this to ensure it extracts its pound of flesh. Like PTSD you will understand much for discovering the key to this game but at such a price that you never truly recover. I leave it to you to decide what lessons and joy you choose to extract from your time gaming but do not believe this to be anything other than cruelty disguised as pleasure.,10,dinâmico publico alvo diverso muitas escolhas de personagens os pontos fortes do jogo q vem crescendo muito seu maior ponto fraco é que como atrai diversos públicos acaba vindo pessoas toxicas que acabam com o jogo deixando ele estressando,9,I've played hundreds of hours of this game and there's always some new nuance to learn and explore plus it's mad fun to watch.

Funny champions are most of the time extremely expensive kinda forcing you to pay real money for them. The laning phase is extremely boring and basically it's a bad ripoff of Warcraft 3's mod Dota all-stars. The rune and mastery system is boring and unnecessary... Can't find many good things about the game.,1,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        yeas ago this used to be a decent game i returned to play again and it is a far cry from what it was.To say this community is the worst of any on line game is being  kind and RIOT  has given up an policing it Expect tot be banned if you speak at all  but do expect racist verbal abuse and  large portion of the player base to be there purely to ruin your game and the punishment system is run by the same players I am sorry to see what used to be a good game unless you plan on never speaking or having someone level up your account for RLM this  game 's community makes it unworthy of play,0,League of legends is a MOBA style game that at first seems like it has a lot to offer. The gameplay is pretty solid and aside from the weekly updates the servers are almost never down. They have come a long way since they first started and when I started playing (somewhere around 6 years now) and have made many improvements to the stability of the game. A lot of people complain aboutLeague of legends is a MOBA style game that at first seems like it has a lot to offer. The gameplay is pretty solid and aside from the weekly updates the servers are almost never down. They have come a long way since they first started and when I started playing (somewhere around 6 years now) and have made many improvements to the stability of the game. A lot of people complain about the community and while it is true that it may be one of the most hostile communities that I have ever been a part of this is very easily countered with the mute button and ignoring toxic players. The real key issues that I have with the game are the way that the game matches players. If you play poorly for enough games and your win loss ratio drops low enough you will be matched against the absolute worst players that the game can find in order to even out. That makes sense from a business standpoint because you want your customers to stick around and not get mad when they can't win a game. However if you win a few games the pendulum swings so far in the opposite direction that it is near impossible to win a match no matter how good you and your team play. After several thousands of games I noticed that the key number was +40 and -10. this becomes frustrating for veteran players who just want to play a few good matches against even opponents and not worry too much about a w/l ratio. The second issue that I have with the game is a catch 22. The game is constantly being updated and the devs are making slight tweaks to the game twice a month or more. While this may seem like a good thing at first it really has become a hassle. Aside from changing many of the champions and tweaking damage ratios the devs have decided to completely rework some of the champions. This is also frustrating because people like myself tend to enjoy sticking to certain play styles and builds but every few weeks I have to almost relearn an entire game. For example a few months back when you played a tank champion you played him as just that a bullet sponging heavy hellbent on soaking up as much damage as you could while not putting much damage back on the field. This all changed recently and now the key to winning is rolling a few tanks and building them as tanks then completely and utterly running over everything in your path because the damage output has to "reflect the damage potential of all the characters." So now instead of building a strong attack champion I am stuck trying to counter the damage from the tanks which of course puts me in a huge dilemma because now I can't build the damage to hurt them. So in conclusion League of Legends is a game that most people can pick up and play and probably enjoy for some time but eventually you will start to notice all of the little downfalls of the game. The only way to avoid the hassle is to play ranked which is probably the most toxic part of the community. Your best bet is to get a few friends together and play solely with them. The game is fun and I enjoy playing it but the recent changes and the direction that I see the game going are pushing me farther and farther away. TL;DR - LoL is fun but unfair to most players.,0,Very bad relation user-programer because:-Camping is everything in this game-You bought a skin now they change the splash the skills where is my money?-Mirror matches will result in headache-Has no game modes and no custom feature for custom matches-Really weak development for mouse,9,I've been playing this game since 2010 and for the first 4 years I avidly played it but now I barely play once a week.

Only a small fraction of the heroes are actually viable (the game has 130+ heroes ofc it's not balanced). Overall it's just not fun it's frustrating and does not lend itself to new players.

This allows you to have a decent collection of champions when getting right into things.People need to understand that creating these games costs money. The business requires a method of generating income. Anyone complaining that Riot Games makes it more desirable to purchase Riot points than it is to generate influence points needs to rethink this topic.It should be mentioned that no specific benefit is gained by purchasing riot points. They cannot be used to give an advantage over free players. The only benefit to spending actual money is that you do not need to spend the time.New champions are released every two weeks. The second week they are out they put up as Free to play for one week. They rotate champions on a weekly basis ensuring that all of the roles are filled by free picks (support dps tanky dps tanks mage etc)Someone who does not have the expendable income to spend on the game and also does not have much time to play will need to be content with the free champions until they find one that they truly want to play as their main champion and purchase it.It should be noted that most players tend to stick to 3-6 champs that they play most often.A great game. A great price. A great business model.I recommend this to everyone I talk to that plays video games.,0,Ugly outdated horrible community RIOTs record of releasing OP champs and nerfing them after enough ppl buys them artstyle really not my coup of tea its like playing pokemons which i suppose is a good think since its aimed for 12yo kids with parents credit card...,0,First i wanna say that im pro of this game.

(Just go to a LAN to see what I'm talking about)  However it is just far too boring for my tastes.

(Just go to a LAN to see what I'm talking about)  However it is just far too boring for my tastes.  I realize that the learning curve is VERY high and that some feel its extremely addicting but a RTS that involves controlling a single unit most of the time is just too boring.  Some say that the multilayer brings more depth to the game but in my experience it just adds more randomness to the players experience.  Will you be matched with a balanced team or get steamrolled?  Will you sit at the load screen waiting for a match to begin only to realize you've wasted your time?  Will half your team quit at the drop of a hat?Then there's the visual style which to me is offensive to the eye.  Over-saturated colors and a hideously "busy" graphical styles are not aesthetically pleasing to me.  Add to this the terrible sound effects (particularly hearing the announcer woman rattle off info CONSTANTLY) and the experience becomes even less pleasant.  Worst of all is the games pricing model.  Free2play can be done correctly.  Team Fortress 2 is a perfect example.  Money spent is primarily on cosmetic items and any weapons found in the store can easily be earned for traded for in-game.  LoL on the otherhand gives a distinct advantage to players who either spend money or those with lots of play-time.  Level ups and the horribly clunky "ruin" system make skill far less important.  Don't get me wrong.  The tremendous learning curve of LoL means experienced players will win over newer ones time and time again.  The devs like to think the matchmaking system works well but its just not the case and teams are notoriously unbalanced. So why give this game a 0?  Despite the many hours (for my friends sake) that I've wasted on this game I have never enjoyed myself even for a brief moment.  I understand that people love it.  It wouldn't be the most poplar game in the world if they weren't having fun but for me this is an experience I can do without.,9,This game successfully follows up as a more casual form of the all time favorite DOTA providing a plethora of champions to choose to fight as.

Overall a fun game especially at the price of free.,7,The graphics suck and were clearly thought out by amateurs. The gameplay is fantastic as it is a copy of Dota one of the best multiplayer experiences ever. However they have taken what Dota was and actually made it worse downgrading it in many ways.

The gameplay is fantastic as it is a copy of Dota one of the best multiplayer experiences ever. However they have taken what Dota was and actually made it worse downgrading it in many ways. The balance is awful for this type of game with half the characters being unplayable in tournaments because they aren't as good as the other half. Every character feels the same and plays the same as the other. You can only play 10 of the entire pool of heroes per week unless you pay them money or play excessively long to unlock some. Invisible and different heroes are the awful because they are so weak as to be made completely useless to protect the noob players. The game is also so stale and predictable with as few possible elements to make the game complex. In Dota the game is more about thinking than simply repeating the same maneuver from game to game. You will get bored of this bad downgrade of a warcraft III map.,0,At first I get a lot of fun from this game. But with the passage of time I get bored from the game all the things in the game just like wasting your time you have to 30 lvl to join ranked.

But with the passage of time I get bored from the game all the things in the game just like wasting your time you have to 30 lvl to join ranked. And the game art skin of the champions is totally very bad all of the skin is not suitable of the champion.At last the graphic of this game this game graphic didn't update for years and there are more and more choices for me to choose from and I am not going the choose this game. Some other people said this game add a new hero every month yeah really but didn't you find that each time they release a hero that is very strong powerful expensive like the Aatrox. And like after 1 week or 2 weeks it get nerfed it just like cheating you to buy the hero. The graphic the graphic engine is really really old it is almost same with WC3. The balance. In my view I don't think League champions is imbalanced because they are all same.But in the other way the rune and they way of purchasing champions is imbalanced you have to use a lot of time to bank the credit to buy the champion you want if you want to save your time? Buy it using your real money this way make the game become Pay to Win. Again example of Aatrox if you want to become powerful? Buy it and you will get fake because it get nerfed after a week and now you want to buy another champion. Also the skin of those champions most of the time you can't get a skin without paying the real money. As every know that this game borrowed some mechanics from DotA and "improve" it to a more easy game as soon you will find that most of the game mechanics and strategies are gone it makes the game bored every game is same. One of the reason is because Game not rewarding players for learning advanced mechanics the players will just keep using the basic mechanics. So every game you will get some team mate which people call them "NOOB" No offence. This is why I gave up this game. The players in league is also bad like they complaint about the game balance they said that skill is too fxxkin' OP that is because they don't have to skills to counter it most of them are not mature At last I don't really recommend you to play this game because its really bored wasting time to compete with player only know the basic.,0,I played this game and I feel like this game is for kids if you want to join competitive scene you can master this game in short time. The story line of LoL quite weak there is connected between champions but the reason of why 2 different camps want to fight each other that is unknown reason by the way kids don't bother that.

BUY IT or earn the coins slowly by playing it non-stop. Wow there is rune system want upgrade it to full? BUY IT. Conclusion: For casual play this is a nice game to spend your time to play but if you want to become pro? PLEASE BECOME A RICH GUY and YOU WILL BECOME MASTER OF League of Legends!,2,Pros:- Easy to learn- Fast matchmaking- Have other maps- Easier to earn gold in-game- Spammable skills Cons:- Bad Graphics- Sound quality is kinda bad for me- Unbalanced- Limited champs to choose from- Lesser strategies- Game play is just same every game- Pay to win,0,lmao this game is terrible. every champion has a dash and auto attack modifier. You have to buy the champions and you have to buy runes and Mastery Points? Is this an RPG or a MOBA? The idea of having to buy champions for 6300 points is retarded.

If Riot knew how to balance we'd be seeing more of Ghost and Heal and Clairvoyance. Just be like Jason She and quit the game and do something better with your lives,1,This game is fun but the community is just bad and you have to pay money to buy all the champions unlike Dota which cost 60 bucks  you don't have to pay anymore but for League Of Legends I spend about 200 bucks and I still don't have all the champs. I would just stay away from this game!!,0,One of the most overrated games by far. Quite possibly the least fun game there is and one of the worst.First off the community is TERRIBLE. Since it's an online game the community is a huge part of it but God it's bad.Gameplay. The game's target audience is autistic nerds with triple glasses that can't have fun because the adrenaline rush might kill them. That's how fun it is.,9,Its going to get a 10 when they fix all the bugs there is with the friend system but league of legends is with out a doubt a more intens fun and player friendly game than dota. You get an intro to a basic champion and get to lear all the basic thing the you can go join other for a pratic battle you have a feeling how long they have played when you look at there lvl and maybe even at Its going to get a 10 when they fix all the bugs there is with the friend system but league of legends is with out a doubt a more intens fun and player friendly game than dota. You get an intro to a basic champion and get to lear all the basic thing the you can go join other for a pratic battle you have a feeling how long they have played when you look at there lvl and maybe even at there wins it they have played normal games which count in other players eyes. You can also choose to play agains bots so that you can leave anytime you want and you can get to lear some heros if you dont feel so confident in just jumping into some random game. If you compare that to dota where you dont have any idea how good a player is you cant really play agains bots atleast not any who have a brain so you have to play for a while to have a chance to win you dont have to have played any rounds in this game before you have a chance to win if you are against opponents who is around your own lvl. So its easy to start and itll get more and more intense and harder and harder the more you play because youll get to play against ppl who is at your own lvl and therefor have played it about as long as you have. And when the friend system works a little better you can team up with your friends so you can make tactics and stuff like that. Well then gl and hf,3,League of Legends as all other DotA games fails miserably in balance. If you enjoy real competitive pvp you will hate this game. If you enjoy mindlessly killing people you might like this but would in the end be better off buying a singleplayer game.,10,game created by the same person who developed Dota meaning successor to Dota. This game is full of fun and gets quite addictive. Although losing may be frustrating sometimes it hooks you into the game and you'll never be able to let go of this.,10,It's the DOTA variation that we all dreamed about. The f automatic match making based on ELO easy interface and reconnection possibility and a penalizing system for those cheaters and leavers... ETC. And to top it off it has really unique set of heroes and a complex combination of masteries and runes that you can use to come up with your own combo.,7,The problem with League of Legends isn't a problem with the game itself per se (although there are quite a few flaws in the system that although not gamebreakers do ruin the experience) but rather with the absolutely terrible community and the design of MOBA's themselves. Firstly although there are many genuine gamers in the LoL community who are just out there to have fun and atThe problem with League of Legends isn't a problem with the game itself per se (although there are quite a few flaws in the system that although not gamebreakers do ruin the experience) but rather with the absolutely terrible community and the design of MOBA's themselves. Firstly although there are many genuine gamers in the LoL community who are just out there to have fun and at times truly do want to help new and struggling players the vast majority of LoL players are complete and utter jackasses that are completely self-centered in an entirely team-based game. I keep finding myself playing horrible games where a single teammate will just ruin it for everyone by being a complete dick to everyone on the team. In fact I find people who dont understand how to play a more enjoyable teammate than one that just completely ruins the experience with his mindless drivel. But I think this problem stems from the MOBA genre itself. Although LoL has many features to reduce the severity of this problem (no loss of gold on death lower champion level cap etc) MOBA's are very very infuriating to play when you can't play them right. Games usually just boil down to "Who can make the most mistakes first" instead of actual knowledge and skill and this only increases the amount of anger which in turn increases the amount of mistakes and creates a vicious cycle only dedicated players can escape from. A lot of people talk about "ELO Hell" and how it doesn't or does exist and I think that it does exist for some and not for others mainly because of this. LoL is great for people new to the MOBA genre since it seems to be the most user-friendly of them all (DOTA 2 is VERY punishing towards noobies) but even a benevolent dictator is a dictator. TL;DR: Good game if you are patient and willing to put up with ****,6,It's a pretty nice and easy introduction to the MOBA genre much easier than the other options on the market and free if you choose to not  get skins. However  the community is horrible and the client is hopelessly outdated. Each game  lasts quite long and is very monotonous however. It's hard to  play more than 1 or 2 games in a row.,0,'Free to play' is attractive but this is not fun. Honestly I do not know why. When I play this game I feel so boring. Free but do not want to. [Waste of time],0,Very easy does not offer challenges for those who usually play games of this genre. There is no strategy. The roles are completely static. It's imbalanced.

It requires lots of strategizing and planning cooperation with your teammates quick thinking and ability to time and place actions accurately.  It's free to play and everything gameplay-wise can be earned without paying.  It requires a rather fast computer to be able to play effectively and games tend to take a while so don't play if you can't finish the match.  The game is rather difficult to get into as there is a lot to it to learn and get better at and it's rather slow going when it comes to unlocking new champions to use.  There is a lot of customization involved so you can definitely use your own play style but this is also dangerous if you don't know much about what you're doing.  Overall it's a fun well-designed competitive game and I highly recommend it to those who have the time.  If this review was the most helpful source of information on this game you've found please refer Tempestrie.,10,I play this game for almost 3 years. One of best games i ever played. And I cant belive how someone could actualy hate on one of best games ever. Realy I wonder where all those objective reviews comes from ...,9,People are saying that some of the characters are OP (overpowered) yes some are somewhat easier than others but if your good and spend more time learning what the characters do you can say their pretty much equal just not on the the same area like some are good on the beginning some are good at other lanes you just need to know where to put the characters in the map and timing is anPeople are saying that some of the characters are OP (overpowered) yes some are somewhat easier than others but if your good and spend more time learning what the characters do you can say their pretty much equal just not on the the same area like some are good on the beginning some are good at other lanes you just need to know where to put the characters in the map and timing is an important thing. LOL vs Dota 2:I've been playing Dota 2 and LOL which one is better?  well i would say it depends on the person i personally like LOL more cause its clear where you are and the map isn't as big.  What do i mean by that?  Dota 2 has a more darker gameplay the minions / creeps are bigger than LOL and the characters aren't highlighted that much this leads to not knowing where your character is and you can click on minions / creeps losing your character while in LOL the place is clear it has more light in it the characters are popping out a bit  and the minions are small so you can focus on watching the enemy team and knowing the right moment to attack and you always have your character's life on screen and can get back to him / her anytime another thing is the map is not that big and not much other things (trees cliffs etc) so its more clear where you are.  They are even planning to change the whole area so that you can see more when your battling and even know where you are without looking in the map (i know that's sounds stupid but sometimes looking at the map can get you killed.)  and they'll clear out some unnecessary things that makes the game look bad. So i definetly recommend LOL.,0,Really boring and easy game.I can't enjoy this brat game LoL.Heroes are too artificial.Too many heroes appear in this game and hero picks are really hard.Worst MOBA ever.,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        I would consider this is a casual online game running by a investment company. Riot try to promo this game as professional/competitive game but run in the opposite way. I even doubt whether they understand their product in deep. 1. characters are unbalance. You can find the counter characters easily. It makes the game less competitive and boring. 2. lazy client service. No matter what your request is the answer would be the same. 3. Dishonest company. These people care more about the advertisement and quantity of players rather than the quality. Lots of fake statements and statistic data you can find here. Riot try to make people believe that being nice is the way for the win but not skill. 4. crazy language/mind control. There is no freedom of speaking in this game at all. You cannot say anything negative to anyone even though they are completely unskill. 5. negative attitude/unskill players in the game. Most players do not care about the win/lose and these players are usually bad. Nothing you can do for yourself and you have to chill them up just like a babysitter. 6. matching system. I cannot tell they ever improve the matching system. I had a unrank player in silver 2 rank game before which was ridiculous.,1,so i've been playing this game for a while now and i gotta tell you it sucks at most this is a waste of battery life and i know the developers only want you to play so you can "invest" in new champions and skins no this game sucks ass,3,I give it 3 coz I really love this game. It has rather poor graphics but it's free has addictive game-play and doesn't destroy it with micro payments that are not a must to have fun. But what's the point to like game when you actually cannot play it? The only time when I'm able to log into without much of a problem is around midnight.

Because when you're asked to wait hour to log you have to waste this hour for smth and in most cases after like 55mins of waiting you will get server disconnected mssg anyway and will have to start all over again. So even as this game is 8 maybe even 9 for me I gave it 3 - for all this wasted time for waiting.,1,what with this game got good rating i played it i got virtually bored in with 5 mins i thought be like guild wars    but no some kind of game remind me total annihilation old game i had way back but this game i deleted after 10 mins 5 mins of game play 5 mins later deleting it,1,LoL is a god awful game The graphics are just terrible I played this game just before it released and I could not tolerate it for longer than 5 mins before I was forced to quit.

Would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun time or casually gaming at a LAN party :).,10,One of the best RTS games in our generation. It is updated regularly and champions added regularly. There are very many champions currently with different ways of play style such as Attack Damage(AD/DPS) Ability Power(AP/Mage) Tank and Support.,1,So based upon my first review  The balance gets better once u know how to play it (i recommend to get a friend that knows it to explain to you) But the disconnecting penalty system is totally unreliable + they give you an option to explain your disconnects but theres no chance they will lift it (what exactly is the point of it then?)Bear this in mind before u read what my experience is:So based upon my first review  The balance gets better once u know how to play it (i recommend to get a friend that knows it to explain to you) But the disconnecting penalty system is totally unreliable + they give you an option to explain your disconnects but theres no chance they will lift it (what exactly is the point of it then?)Bear this in mind before u read what my experience is:-"Q: I just got disconnected from two games! Am I Going to get banned?A: Probably not. The system will nail you only for a pattern of doing this."-"On December 14th we launched our automated leaver banning system. The purpose of this system is to dissuade players from leaving games/going AFK. We do this first by giving a warning and then banning in larger and larger increments when players leave games/go AFK."-"Q: How long can I get banned for?A: The automated system can ban you for anywhere between 1 hour and 7 days for any particular issue. However we will be sweeping the records and will periodically perma-ban people that hit the 7 day ban too many times."-"Q: How do I 'work off' leaves?A: You can reduce points either through time (having no penalties for several weeks) and through every game you complete in matchmaking that was not a leave or that you contributed to for the whole duration of the game."In my experience: i have 3 disconnects 1st one i didnt know about this system 2nd one i had to leave because an emergency in real life 3th one i got disconnected by a a gamefreeze because the server was extremely lagging took up to 5-6 seconds before my character did what i told it to do and therefore it was unplayable anyway.1st: leaving 2 games is not a pattern => apparently leaving 3 games is cause i got suspended for a day (!)2nd: So according to their FAQ they could have just suspended my account for an hour which seems more 'reasonable' if they really wanted to ban my account for those 3 leaves. instead i got a full day.3th: I would also like to warn anyone on planning playing this game that IF u leave (based upon my XP) for about 10 games probably you will get banned for 7 days. And if u do this often you will get PERM banned.4th: They claim to send u a warning trough email if your disconnecting level gets to high.This is a lie period. I triple checked my e-mail and the only thing i've found was the email they sent me when i actually got the suspension. 5th: The system is completely unreliable as there are too many variables that need to be taken in account when you enforce this kind of system. for instance: PC crash modem crash game freezes and not starting up again Real life mathers.. Its a noble idea but it lacks a lot in execution. If u are a die hard pro this system then i can only say wait untill ur game crashes a few times or ur power drops out or whatever else can happen to you and u get banned for a couple days because of that and thats the point. There is no reliability Banning for 3 dissconnects without a warning without a so called pattern they mentioned 3times is not a pattern whatsoever. And instead one hour a day = sad. Other games require people to be there and participate as well and its very annoying if one of em leaves for any of the reasons i described above but yet its understandable that u can run into situations you dont have any choice.Tho these games do not have this penalty system and still work fine without it.games like CoH Starcraft WC3.. pretty much any good strategy game out there.Yes you will most likely lose games because of this but everyone will encounter that at a certain point. Here a part of my useless message to riotgames related to that suspension: "First time i read that message i wasn't really happy with something like that sure if a player leaves that screws up the game for others. But same story with new players who dont know how to play the game yet. The main question raises in my mind is: Is riotgames going to suspend accounts for being new and screw up the game for others by not knowing how to play? Are you going to suspend accounts for people that have to leave because of an emergency?This whole concept sounds like a noble idea to prevent ragequitting but there is no way to know the reasons why anyone would leave a game. Some find it a good idea im one of the people that saying its noble but not reliable at all period. regards Tritrium" In the end its no use to send them messages as they wont lift bans. 3 disconnects -> no warning = a day banned.If i didnt know any better i would say this is quite insane for leaving 3 games. RegardsTritrium,10,A truly worthy successor and standalone of the incredibly popular Defense of the Ancients.

I finally uninstalled it in fall 2013 and haven't looked back. This game WILL anger you.  This game WILL frustrate you.  This game WILL end up wasting a lot of your time.  Whether its the queues ragers who throw out games or the fact that you're locked into games for a solid 30+ minutes there's a LOT of time that goes down the drain.  Out of my 1500 hours I probably sat around wishing I wasn't in a particular match or waiting in queues or being extremely frustrated for about 200 hours.  This is a generous estimate btw it was most likely more time. After I finally uninstalled the frustration in my life cleared up.  I get along more easily with people and I no longer feel like I'm wasting time when I'm playing video games (even though it technically is a waste haha). The game is fun but I believe the MOBA genre is too new it needs to be refined.,0,I played this game and I feel like this game is for kids if you want to join competitive scene you can master this game in short time.  The story line of LoL quite weak there is connected between champions but the reason of why 2 different camps want to fight each other that is unknown reason by the way kids don't bother that. I have no comment on LoL graphics because I love to playI played this game and I feel like this game is for kids if you want to join competitive scene you can master this game in short time.  The story line of LoL quite weak there is connected between champions but the reason of why 2 different camps want to fight each other that is unknown reason by the way kids don't bother that. I have no comment on LoL graphics because I love to play 2D fighting game bad graphics but I quite enjoyed it. For a newbie they only able to play some of champions wanna play more? BUY IT or earn the coins slowly by playing it non-stop. Wow there is rune system want upgrade it to full? BUY IT. Conclusion: For casual play this is a nice game to spend your time to play but if you want to become pro? PLEASE BECOME A RICH GUY and YOU WILL BECOME MASTER OF League of Legends!,9,People who aren't used to playing MOBA games will have some trouble with LoL. Those however who have played such games before will find a completely new and inviting world of tactical team-play and quick choice. It is one of those games that can break a players spirit if he gives up before learning all the ropes of the LoL playing style but those that keep on learning and thriving willPeople who aren't used to playing MOBA games will have some trouble with LoL. Those however who have played such games before will find a completely new and inviting world of tactical team-play and quick choice. It is one of those games that can break a players spirit if he gives up before learning all the ropes of the LoL playing style but those that keep on learning and thriving will soon end up playing almost nothing else but League of Legends. At the moment it offers over 100 champions and 4 different play styles (3v3 5v5 Dominion ARAM) in 4 different maps and a 5v5 ranked queue which gives you even more motivation to become a better and tactically more profound player. It got me hooked and I think Riot games did a good job with this one. Although the game is not the most original ever made It has it's own unique lore and offers a more direct and dynamic playing experience than games such as DotA and HoN. A must for MOBA fans.,0,This game so bad.I played this game 3 year.Teamfights so fuzzyı can't see anything in combats.Quality of players so bad.Graphics really bad.Skins are  so poor and all heroes have attack speed boost.,0,This game is flat out awful. It's imbalanced has horribly graphics frequent lag and server downtime and the developers don't seem to care about their game in general. Stay well clear of this one. BAD GAME BAD GAME...... REALLY BAD COPY FOR DOTA :S,0,I've played this game and all I have to say is that this is probably the worst game in the world first things first i copies the hell out of the first dota and second the community is  and It's such a overrated game.

This lobotomized community is the biggest pain in the ass I've seen in an online game and I saw a lot of online game communities.If you are a kid or a desperate virgin though you may be able like all the half-naked characters this greedy development team release and the expensive skins they sell to make them even more naked. League of Legends is the actual plague of online games and more generally of the whole gaming. A lot of online communities are now invaded by people who barely know how to play video games and who always choose the easy way to win the games they play. This "the easier the better" way of "gaming" is spreading and killing the real good gaming. if you have a gamer's soul and a minimum of critical spirit and taste stay far from this game you don't wanna mess with it. 3/10 and it's because i'm trying not to be mean.,10,I've been playing this game for over a year now (I was a beta tester for this game) and i would like to say it's awesome i've had very little to no problems with crashes (Like previous people have been complaining about) it takes little memory resources for my computer (DDR3 RAM 4gb) and i have spent absolutely nothing on the game (I have played roughly 1000 matches on this game allI've been playing this game for over a year now (I was a beta tester for this game) and i would like to say it's awesome i've had very little to no problems with crashes (Like previous people have been complaining about) it takes little memory resources for my computer (DDR3 RAM 4gb) and i have spent absolutely nothing on the game (I have played roughly 1000 matches on this game all together) and i am still playing it. This is the same with many of my friends (I invite a friend every month or so and try to make them a pro). You can play this casually or competitivly. Paying money gains you little to no advantage (It only allows you to get characters faster) all the characters are balanced (You just need to know how to play them) some are easier than others and that's when misconceptions seem to happen you can't allow these ignorant people put you off trying this game. (Graphics aren't everything).,10,Free 2 Play! And properly! I played it for 200 hours + and never had a disadvantage for not paying! But there is loads of stuff to buy!

Particularly taking into consideration that it's free-to-play (and they mean it you'll gain no competitive advantage with money just cosmetics) the game delivers. The real balance issues are minor and when I say that I dismiss the slew of complaints from players who mistake the objective of the game to be killing other players rather than winning. I'd have given a 9.5 if it were an option but settled on 9 because of course the game isn't *quite* perfect.,10,this is a really really fun game. It's multiplayer only so it's rough if you expect to learn in single player but it's a lot easier to get into than DOTA and its a lot less punishing in feel with a much nicer community. Supposedly its very competitive too. I like the faster pace and greater emphasis on team combat compared to DOTA.,10,Fun champions a less steep learning curve than DOTA a great online community and a development team that actually listen to their players make this a game not to be missed!,10,Captivating and extremely well conceived title.

I'v been waiting a long time for a game like this.,5,I guess I'm alone on this but this game is so boring. It's like WoW mechanics just pick a spell pick a bad guy and hope you don't run out of mana/health. The teamwork aspect is nice however doesn't hold enough to spark my interest.,10,This game is great! It's absolutely free and the graphic style is unique. The learning curve is great and when you start playing with friends it just gets better! Not to mention the friendly comunity and fun atmosphere.,10,This is one of the best games I have ever played - I haven't been so addicted to a game since I first played World of Warcraft! I can't stop playing and it's a ton of fun.,10,Firstly how can you argue with free. Even if you don't like it you never had to pay a thing to try it. That doesn't matter though because the game is awesome fun and easy to play difficult to master. What more could you really ask for in a game?,8,Graphics/Performance(10/10): Graphics are reminiscent of WoW and Warcraft III that is they are cartoony and artistic rather than gritty and cutting-edge.  Game runs very well even on older computers. Singleplayer(N/A): Non-existent. Multiplayer(8/10): Solid multiplayer marred by a horrible balance team.  Game finding interface is easy to use.

They have tons of original heroes and a lot of long term goals for the game. It looks really promising. They're pretty strict in enforcing language and behavioral issues so make sure to not use any racial slurs or stuff like that! Go Riot ! :D,10,Best MOBA out there. I came from DOTA and I also tried HON but this game really proves itself over and over to be the best MOBA out there. And it's free.,10,Awesome game!

The challenge to unlock all champions just makes the game playable for a long time instead of some games that have only few unlocks.And its so easy to find a game to participate in it just takes like 2-3 seconds to find one.The games has his downside but the game play just makes it all up. So that's why i give League of legends a 9 out of 10.,8,Amazing free to play game. It did so well that it forced games like HoN to change to the LoL format. It takes a while to get going and there is a lot of smurfing (its a ftp game of course people will have multiple accounts).

This is certainly a game to have handy if you've got an hour to kill and want to fill it with a great team based strategy game.,7,Being a very long member of the LoL community I would say this game is too heavily reliant on your team (and nothing else). It punishes you more for other teammates' mistakes and less rewarding for your own achievements. But! The premades and friends you make could more than make up for it (maybe...).,10,This game is forever evolving. And the developers have shown they can change and adapt well.

Some of the people who worked on the First DOTA game for WC3 are still working with Riot Games now and have greatly improved their focus in design. Art team is extremely passionate and does their  best as well both making new standards and updating the older work from when the company was very tiny. Voice acting is pretty spot on. They pull from the LA bunch so they have a good pool of VOs Unlike most games there is actually a player behavior TEAM. Negative player experiences are met with punishment while allowing for players to reform their behavior at the same time. The only dislike is perhaps the time it takes to get characters in game without spending obscene amounts of money or time. But if you like the game that will come in time using in game currency. The game has a fairly hard learning curve but of all the MOBAs it is perhaps the smallest one out there with tons of player made guides and tips there is plenty to get anyone started.,8,Don't let some of the older reviews fool you LoL has come a long way and there's plenty of good things to say about it. The graphics are fine and fit a niche. There are a huge number (around 80) of champions at the moment so there's plenty of replayability.

Most players are pretty competitive too so there's always a good challenge. I disagree with people who say it's less "hardcore" than DotA or HoN. I've played both of those and feel they are less team-oriented than LoL where you're team is constantly struggling to end up with more gold than the other team so they can make a push to try and win the game. My only real complaints are that there are some small issues that Riot chooses not to fix (like no way to scale minimap) and they tweak the game a little too hard some times and it throws things off a lot. If you enjoy team-oriented games and hero building games like DotA then you should give it a shot. It's free after all,10,League of legends is probably one of the most played games of this generation. Has it earned its reputation or is it just a waste of time?

The first and main mode is Summoners Rift where you fight in an 5 vs 5 battle. Your team has to pick from a roster of over 100 characters. These would include roles such as damage dealers tanks supports and many more. With your chosen team you have to defeat the enemy and take down their base. The second mode is Twisted Treeline which is like Summoners Rift but 3 vs 3 players. Dominion which is the last mode is more a "capture the flag" game where you have to take controll over 5 towers before the enemy. While everything is fun it is Summoners Rift that will probably hold your attention the most. One of the more common complaint is the lack of map only one per game mode. But its exactly like saying that football needs different maps.Outside the whole battles you will still have much to plan. Each and every level - up to 30 - you will gain IP a rune and masteri slot. Ip is the currency which you buy characters and runes for. Runes are improvements like higher damage faster attack speed etc and masteries are like runes but free. One annoying thing is that characters and runes can get really expensive. This is a game which you have to invest many hour to maximise you playstyle. League of Legends has many flaws. But with that said all of the flaws are ought weight by all of its positive notes. What is broken is usually fixed and new improvements arrives every week. The character selection and all the runes and masteries can become overwhelming but you will learn the use of everything. What can sour you experience however are players who know nothing about good sportsmanship and teamplay so it is recommended to play with a pre-made team of friends than strangers. But all in all its a fun game and the part best of all it is absolutely free so there is actually no reason to complain about the game and its content and it has earned its status among the people,8,This game is rather fun in its own right but the fact that it's free-to-play makes it excellent.

While its graphics are not the best they are plenty sufficient for an enjoyable experience and have been improved over time. The gameplay is simple enough to quickly learn the basics but also has a great deal of depth for advanced players to master. There is a truly staggering array of champions to choose from and several different roles so there is plenty to learn and experiment with.  This does mean that the game has somewhat of a steep learning curve--since you will have to learn to recognize 50+ champions and remember their abilities--but after a while this will come naturally. My one major complaint about this game is that there is no way to boot out AFK players players who disconnect or trolls so if your team gets stuck with one or more you may be at a permanent disadvantage. Hopefully Riot will address this problem in the future.,8,This game is fantastic and despite what all the original dota fans say it is VERY balanced.

This game shouldn't be compared to dota really. I think they are both good games. but this one is more modern and for a person that isnt slaved to nostalgia goggles.,1,Pros: - good overall game concept- easy to learn Cons: - many imbalances- immature player base- shallow and not that complex game mechanics and strategies- very bad graphics,9,This is a better game than Dota2 if you want to compare it with that.

The customer support is also good i can tell out of experience because I once got hacked and the hacker changed the e-mail adress of the account. Thanks to their customer support I could recover it within 3days. The only minor issue is one that League of Legends can't help; the community for example certain young players ragequit flame suicide or quit because they have to eat/sleep and It feels like the tribunal doesn't punish these players long enough,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.

Its not incentive for new people to play. Also there was not much communication going on in the game. The game is also full of text everywhere which is completely overwhelming for a new player. The shop at the home base and the spells are pretty busy. This has similar problems of a typical RPG except it isn't an RPG. There is some cool fighting going on with similar movements to other RTS games but the core gameplay doesn't seem to be much. You go in and get decimated by powerful players. End of story. Lastly I refuse to play a game that bans me for playing and then having to bow out of a match. Games seem to be very long longer than a physical game would go without any break. Overwhelmingly I can't see why someone would spend longer than 20 minutes getting into this when there are faster action games to play and better strategy games out there. But its at least playable and runs well on old hardware unlike DOTA. So its better than DOTA but I can't say this game is fun at all. You'd have to be kind of retarded to think this game is fun.,7,If i went to 7 is mostly because of the main LoL problem: ''the community''  The game is like they say ''addictive as hell'' and they are improving the champions and made pretty good looking skins so far. The mechanics of the game are pretty nice and you can play for hours. What brings it down is basically the community there's so much aggressive people who ruins your day.

Also the matchmaking is pretty unbalanced: I found myself being the only one level 30 in my team against a 3 Ranked Silver players (who obv are level 30) totally frustrating. Even the new ranked system while better than ELO based one is a mess. You lose 2 matches and you go down 1 division also when you win in the new one you only get 5 points that you lose in a matter of matches. The game for these mentioned reasons gets pretty frustrating in so many ways makes you lose your patience sometimes. It's a shame since the game is so fun and addictive. Not to mention the unbalanced champions some of them have no counter some of them get 3 kills and your match is pretty lost in a matter of minutes. Overall a pretty fun game which gets a ''meets expectations'' but is far from ''outstanding''.,7,This is a pretty good game but it has one major flaw. For the most part it is a 5 on 5 match.

Dont waste your time.,7,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        I have play this game for quite a while... I play it because is a very competitive multiplayer its a extremely easy to learn the community is harsh but I think in this new genre this is very common this is a great game  I have to say but requires a little amount of skill in comparisson with other titles such as dota 2 or Heroes of Newerth. The popularity of this game is due to the way Riot games turn free to play into one of the most succesful type of games. I give this game a 7.,10,I've played very close to 1100 hours of this game by now and that number is only going up. You'll only ever know you enjoy it if you play it and try for yourself. For me that absurd amount of time should speak for itself.,7,The problem is: THE COMMUNITYI never saw so much haters and childs in my life.

There is a lot of content and even after several years more new content is coming. Still LoL was one of the first great game where "Pay2Win" was not possible and as a lot of games later came out trying to do this same system it feels better to start playing F2P without having to hand in 50 bucks to get a small advantadge. The issues in this game can be summed up in one sentence. Riot underestimate greatly the growth of the playerbase's size. This lead to very specific points being fixed turning into champions getting gutted or overpowered because Riot tries too much too answer a plead from what turns out to be a small part of the community. As such the community in this game is unbearable. Ragers leavers griefers squeakers turn a lot of game into a living hell. Play this game with friends. That's all.,7,TO ALL LOL players  LOL is a fun game to play and i sure would play it everyday if there wasn't dota 2 i sincerly advice you to quit this moba war of  and try both. personally i like dota 2 more it's deeper and harder than LOL but sometimes i got sick of russians so i play couple of LOL games,4,League of legends was a game made by riot games is a strategy game with a variety of characters to play.In 1 year the game had a lot of fans.Unfortunately the game is not so good.With the worst graphics ever.Fortunately the moves of the heroes are very good.The game has no story and its gameplay sucks. In a nutshell the game is boring.,4,So unbalanced and so colorful that hurt my eyes and the community is also as bad as well. I don't really know how Riot could copy DotA (that is amazing) and do such a game. I would say DotA is three times better than LOL. Cyka.,0,This game is really fun for little kids aged 12 and under. This game is very boring and holds your hand all the way. You wont feel the excitment while playing. There is no challenge!,0,Definetly not the best of games out there today cant complain to much about them graphics as I enjoy alot of older games with even worse graphics but some heroes are overpowered and this is like a BAD dota 2 copy. Its a game idea stolen from Blizzard and Blizzards alternative is more fun and better game.,0,I've been playing for awhile and it get's boring easily. If you want to start playing this game my advice is to NOT. This game is absolute crap and is horrible.,7,The game itself is really good RIOT's employees are great and the LCS (pro-league) is awesome. The only thing that made me stop playing this game is the community honestly it'd be better if there were no chat at all and everyone just communicated through pings.

I've been playing it for 2 years and to me I can't compare it with DOTA. These are just simply two different games and a war between this two will never stop.

I've been playing it for 2 years and to me I can't compare it with DOTA. These are just simply two different games and a war between this two will never stop. Overall the user score should be way up and should not be taken seriously. This game is addicting once you start it may be a bit unfair since a lot of players on high levels are playing on another account. But when you get higher the game becomes more and more addicting. The urge to rise on the ladders and becoming one of the best is so high that eventually you will be playing at the top too. Give this game a fair chance and maybe you will be playing it too it's fun once you get into it.,3,I guess it's alright for a free game and some people like it but if you're anything like me you'll hate it. Repetitive unbalanced **** controls and essentially pay-to-win mechanics make this game pretty crap.,10,As a game this is near perfect for me. The playerbase is at times extremely hostile but the game itself is very good. This is one of the best games to play with friends.,9,League of Legends is a fantastic game. Most reviews here seem to be focused on the graphics. Why? There is absolutely nothing wrong with the graphics (sure they aren't 10/10 but this allows people with 'not-so-good' PCs to play.) the game can still look awfully pretty. While there are few maps and game modes they don't seem to get boring (I've owned LoL for over a year). And while theLeague of Legends is a fantastic game.

Unlike most free to play games this is NOT a pay-to-win. Sure you can use real money to get things faster but it really doesn't take too long to get the characters you want. Not only this but each week plenty characters are free allowing you to test them before buying them. Overall this is a great game and the only reason I'm not giving it a 10/10 is because of the community. Almost every game you'll get into will be full of someone raging or someone purposely feeding. This isn't really Riot's fault but they could at least cracking down on these users.,6,Probably one of the hardest games for a new player to get into. The levelling system (before you can play ranked games) is very slow and uneventful and new players will often have trouble as they get matched with smurfs/alts (players who already have an account and are levelling a new one) as the skill gap can be huge. Once in the ranked ladder most players continue playing to climbProbably one of the hardest games for a new player to get into. The levelling system (before you can play ranked games) is very slow and uneventful and new players will often have trouble as they get matched with smurfs/alts (players who already have an account and are levelling a new one) as the skill gap can be huge. Once in the ranked ladder most players continue playing to climb higher and although the game is relatively simple and repetitive there is a significant amount of depth in the skills that are needed to get to the highest rankings. The large skill depth somewhat makes up for the fact that the game is superficially simple. Sadly the community is generally quite toxic in game although there are a lot of groups of players who are helpful in providing advice for in game and are generally enjoyable people to be around.,5,Not a bad game but it doesn't mean that is a really good game.This is a MOBA arcade fire-like unfair system and expensive stuff (you can buy with points of the game but the game obey you play more and more to get that points you can also get points with real money) has a cartooned kids style and the people love this game beacause is fun but not for me.,10,I've been playing League of Legends for 2 years now and it's the main game I play.

Even after 2 years their are so many things I havn't conquered and tried. With 121 champions their is really always something new to try. The gameplay is really smooth but the map is descent. Currently the map is a bit unfocused and lacks some qualities that enable one to fully concentrate on the gameplay. Since RIOT takes feedback from players a new map is coming soon in season 5 which looks more modern designed compared to other mobas. The game is really teamwork based and very competitive. Many of my friends play League and it keeps us having fun and enjoy the game even more. The competitive environment in League is immense. Their are many major events in League that inspires you to play League and keeps an interesting conversation with your friends. For instance this year the Worlds Tournament's last game was held in a Korean Football Stadium which was sold out and the whole field also packed. Adding to the love for the game League of Legends is the most popular MOBA on twitch. If you aren't playing league you are watching someone else play league. The game is really easy to learn with a friend and very overwhelmed with all the skill shots and high graphic skills flying around during a teamfight. Their is always something going on in the game and you have to keep up with the fast paced gameplay(competitive). League is a fun game once you get used to the mechanics and ingame logics where then you can exploit on your enemies. Another thing I would like to mention is the community and company works are really cool you are constantly amazed by storyline videos amazing highlights community pop reels Pro Interviews and interactive website storylines. Their is so much to talk about on this game. I'm just going to stop here for now. Just play the game and join the community!,2,I've played this game and i hated it it is always the same thing you click to attack press a button on you're keyboard for magic and that's it.

Due do these being directly caused by having connected with this game I am lead only to believe that my life is made worse for having it involved what so ever. In the event that I return it would be under much deliberation and much regret. Your network is flawed and audible communications and contracts have nearly damned me a second time over my religion has been shaken and it has nothing to do with your characters. I have lost my language because of this interaction and I am furious that I happened to decide to be involved with you in the first place. To assume that I or anyone related to me is honored or otherwise not insulted or dishonored by the society involved in this game is a disgrace of my personal and all integrity involved. Delete my account or I will be forced to take action in various ways. Delete my account for the sake of your honor as it has stripped me of yet another leg to my spider rendered me incapable of flying etc. If my contract survives and I am not rebirthed by the graces of God then I have nothing to say and it will never be enough.,0,Literally a cash-grab at this point by company Ten-cent.

Takes some time to get used to mechanics but once you do its fun and you lose hours playing. The game is free and you gain pretty much no advantage spending money on this game. (Unless you count skins as an advantage),9,It's Warcraft III's Defense of the Ancients custom game on massive steroids.  The graphics are good the customization is deep the pricing is free.

That's it in a nutshell but don't be fooled as this game has plenty of nuance/complexity to keep you from getting the hang of it after one game.  For new players wanting to gain a little feel for the game before going head to head with real players with experience there's a players vs AI mode that will allow you to step up your game without being overwhelmed or yelled at.  This is a mandatory option to explore for brand new players to this game world and will greatly benefit you as you'll learn it all faster in a controlled environment.  Don't let any of the negative scores deter you as League of Legends gives free to play a whole new standard of excellence.

Sometimes it has problems with the servers but you always get a "reward" for your patience- sometimes even in-game currency which you'd usually have to pay for.,0,Really what is this game about? Where is the fun? Why is this crap so popular? The battles are very boring and can last even for 1 hour. Sometimes the battles finish very early because the game lets the noob players play in your team and makes you mad. I can't believe that millions of people are addicted to this crap that it has the same fun like Microsoft PowerPoint... -_-,8,It is a decent game that you can get lots of hours of enjoyment.

I feel hollow after playing too much of this game like having a lengthy enjoyable conversation and realizing I have been talking about nothing. In small doses however this game is commendable in its immersiveness and its generosity in  offering many of the key features for free.,8,This game is great. The community is the only thing that drags it down. Riot constantly updates the game so there is always something new with all the champions and the two game modes it's unlikely that you will get bored of this game.,7,best thing to play for free and best moba for now also it isn't pay 2 win game new champions almost every week patches and fun mod as dominion  and worldwide championship.,10,very fun and interesting game.

I got bored within the first 5 minutes then in another 5 minutes I get frustrated from the awful learning curve this game has.  If you have played MOBA games before then you may be at home.  Otherwise proceed with caution and keep a grasp on your sanity. (I played with Bots so I'd hate to play this with other people.),0,this game is terrible... beyond terrible!!!

This game is repetitive boring and frustrating. This game is only popular because it is free and undemanding (in terms of running on computer).,8,League of Legends is a free-to-play Defense of the Ancients style RTS in which you control one of many champions in a team of 3 or 5 to take on another team of champions. As a summoner you control your champion which can take on one of many roles (such as Tank DPS Ranged DPS Carry) Riot continue to release new champions but there is a need for balance that shows some weeks (UpdatesLeague of Legends is a free-to-play Defense of the Ancients style RTS in which you control one of many champions in a team of 3 or 5 to take on another team of champions. As a summoner you control your champion which can take on one of many roles (such as Tank DPS Ranged DPS Carry) Riot continue to release new champions but there is a need for balance that shows some weeks (Updates are done weekly) One or two champions will be g-g-g-god-like (ha!) to be over-nerfed the next week. This fact doesn't remove from the fun of the game too much but it can become frustrating at times. Another downside to this game is that entering Solo play can be treacherous you can be paired with griefers who are solely trying to ruin the game for your team but don't let that put you off as the game is incredibly fun and challenge and after getting used to it you'll wonder why you didn't play it earlier.,7,While this game is fun and entertaining it has some major flaws. The game itself is based on the DoTA mod for warcraft III. Essentially it is an action RTS game with tower defense elements. You control a champion and try to push each lane. Killing Minions and other champions while destroying towers. It can be very fun especially when you find a good group to play with.

Essentially it is an action RTS game with tower defense elements. You control a champion and try to push each lane. Killing Minions and other champions while destroying towers. It can be very fun especially when you find a good group to play with. Huge balance issues bring it down as the same overpowered characters are constantly being played. Other than the excessive amount of characters to choose from there is very little depth in the game itself. Riot as a developer has some major shortcomings as well. Their patches usually cause more problems than they fix. They constantly promise improvements and additions that never see the light of day. There are only two maps that are currently playable(3v3 and 5v5). Though you will still only ever play one of them (5v5). They have been promising a new map and new modes since launch which was nearly two years ago. They even leaked a map last October that still has yet to be released. As a free to play game it is worth the time for installation. However they make up for the game being free by charging ridiculous amounts for characters and skins. A character or skin will run you $7 to $15 each. No those are not bundle prices those are individual prices. With 70+ characters and each character having 4 or more skins it can get incredibly expensive. To sum up it can be a fun game to play as long as you don't expect any real depth. Just be wary of paying for the characters and skins.,6,I will say that I was very unfair with this game when I first reviewed: I didn't exactly play a lot and I admit that it had some fun factor into it: me being a dota 2 player I didn't expect much but I've been playing it lately and I've been enjoying it too. So what I'll say is the game is good and fun and the fact that it's not as hard as dota 2 make is even more enjoyable sometimes:I will say that I was very unfair with this game when I first reviewed: I didn't exactly play a lot and I admit that it had some fun factor into it: me being a dota 2 player I didn't expect much but I've been playing it lately and I've been enjoying it too. So what I'll say is the game is good and fun and the fact that it's not as hard as dota 2 make is even more enjoyable sometimes: losing a game of dota 2 usually means lots of swearings while here it's much more toned down and even when it happens I just feel more relaxed here than in dota 2 with constant complaining. But I still have the same issues as the last time: 1)The Champions/Heroes Design: I've checked all the characters available and aside for a very VERY few all of them are really bland and just flatout "uninteresting". Personal opinions aside most of the characters jus tlook similar and/or just uninspired even when they had the chance to be unique! For instance Garen's the most generic kind of "paladin" you could see Jinx is a copy of Cammy (no kidding her hair is the same and the face is almost identical) and Akali is the most generic sexy ninja you'll ever see. Oh right the game has a lot of fanservice: almost every female in the game is made to keep the guys "interested" in the game to the point of making them completely boring: giant boobs revealing outfits sexy moanings when they die sexy skins. Really? Well I guess people do love seeing a sexy character once in a while but AT LEAST make them interesting! If I have to pick some favourites Twitch Yasuo Hecarim Nasus Shaco Leona and MAYBE Lucian remain my most favourite looking heroes (I repeat LOOKING not skill wise) of all. They at least look different enough than most... Oh Soraka is a Draenei. That's all folks! 2) IT'S TOO EASY! I've played mostly two to four champions so far but I really didn't feel any challenge at all while playing them: what was challenging was to get a group that wouldn't constantly die and feed the enemies. I play as Sona most of the times and even if we are able to push our lane one or two people are dying so many times and feeding the enemies resulting in a loss.I just don't feel challenged in the end: it's a matter of who kills more at the start. And if your enemies are fed you can basically kiss your match goodbye because even an entire team can't stop him/her! As a result the hard part is to find a good team more than actually learning the champions themselves (which is also needed too I'm not saying the opposite). However considering this is an online game bad people can constantly join in and for bad people I mean people who think of themselves of being supreme beings above humans who think that they're the best. While in the end me the support has the most kills... In the end It's a decent game and nice if you want a relaxing game. But I still think Dota 2 is better in terms of challenge and skill.,0,Pay to Win  plain and simple. New champ every 2 weeks. 6300 ip if earned by playing.

After playing countless hours of both this and Dota I can say that a lot of the things are copied from DotA. Maybe not fully but still somehow.

I can't have a singe solo/duo game without a single feeder/troll/flamer (Note: if you have a premade of 5 you are probably going to have a good game). Kids are on every corner and if they play bad they call lag and useless team mates. Really... lag? I can run this game 120 fps while having maxed out graphics. The cartoon-ish graphic style is lightweight and should run on pretty much anything. I have not played enough this game you say? I started on season 1 and quitted around February on season 3. I was on 1700 elo and still there were a lot of douches. Atleast is it not ruined with constant IAP. Skins are okay and quite a fun idea in my opinion. But still there are a few exceptions. I have to pay money for new icons? That's stupid.,3,When I first started playing this game in beta Riot cared about the game cared about bettering it as a whole but over the past 3 years it has become a barely enjoyable game. Overall it is fun but Riot has turned to the darkside. This is obvious by the many posts on the forums reporting bugs or massive problems that Riot fails to recognize. It is not us silly player simply reinstallWhen I first started playing this game in beta Riot cared about the game cared about bettering it as a whole but over the past 3 years it has become a barely enjoyable game. Overall it is fun but Riot has turned to the darkside. This is obvious by the many posts on the forums reporting bugs or massive problems that Riot fails to recognize. It is not us silly player simply reinstall your game which rarely if ever fixes anything. They released an ARAM map which most new computers have FPS fluxes and massive lag that is only fixed by toning down the graphics. In all honesty Riot simply does not know how to optimize a game. There are countless bugs on champ release dates and old bugs resurface which in all honest makes me believe that the PBE server is just for making sure the new champ is powerful enough to drain the wallets of players. Riot is a bunch of greedy  Champions used to be 6300 which if you played solidly each month you could have the new champ by release if you wanted. Now they are 7800 and drop back down after a week. This was simply a ploy by Riot to get more money which I am sure they are doing. Riot works in 3 steps. 1)Relase OP Champ2) Profit3)Nerf champ into ground Morello is a  joke. He is the head designer and main balance king and he is not even out of Silver. He is just an average joe. Why is he in charge of anything? The fact they built this on Adobe Air is retarded. The first lesson I learned in school and college when taking App design classes was Adobe Air is  don't use it AT  ALL. To address the kids who say this game is Pay 2 Win. You are right. Kids who say it is not. Get Riots sack out of your mouth. I will break it down simply for you to show you how it is Pay 2 Win. There are 2 friends Mike and Joe. Mike has disposable income/Parents Credit Car and Joe barely makes rent/is Kenny McCormick They both are still able to play the same amount of games. Mike is able to buy EXP boosts and IP boosts as well as new champs on release while Joe can only use IP to get champs. Very quickly Mikes champ pool is huge as he has been able to use all IP on runes for his Rune pages while Joe doesn'thave a single page full of runes and only a few champs that he loves that have been nerfed and are no longer viable that he spent IP on. Mike is already at a huge advantage to every other person like Joe who plays the game. It is very close to how professional sports are. More   the best things. Which is why pro sports are somewhat stale. THis game used to be fun but in short the game is too big for Riots britches and it is going to hell very quickly. Client is garbage and Riot is just exploiting their Players. What is this? Riot is bringing back the rare X-MAS and Halloween Skins? I  WONDER WHY!? TO MAKE MORE MONEY Riot go  yourselves. People of the Meta stay away from this game. Play anything else. FPS DOTA2 Women anything is worth your time more so than LoL. Also as already stated the community is full of testicleless teens who will report you if your so much as pinch them and hurt their fragile feelings,0,I lived and slept this game and witnessed all the crap the developers have implemented.

From the slow and questionable character balancing overpriced micro-transactions dramatically overhauling and champ remodels and voices after you've purchased them without your consent the brain-dead-and-totally-not-band-aid-solution that was Tribunal (that backfired so hard they shut it down) to fully automated perma-ban sollution to the most...depressing conceited immature self-indulgent braggadocious narcissistic report-happy self-contradicting impossible unreasonable fun-depriving unimaginative spamming excessively elitist and laughably stupidest community. Oh they also decided to restructure the servers and increased the ping on the west coast on average by 50ms and when i was playing at my peak in skill. I could do things with 15ms on characters like "Ezreal" and "Lee Sin" that just are not humanly possible on 70ms. That is another issue. There is so many god damn cheaters on this game now. Leaguesharp and Bot of Legends had an estimated 30000 combined global users. The camera is too zoomed in and I miss using able to use a zoomhack to actually now feel cross eyed after i play this game. I have to squint to actually see my character nowadays since my eyes have suffered from 5 years of Computer Addiction. Okay is just boils down to this. The problem is this "game" is incredibly addicting and once you try out all the unique characters and pull off all the possible plays. Their is just nothing left. It's rinse and repeat. None of the games ever matter what so ever. Just playing this game is illogical Dota 2 is a far more dynamic complex game with a skill ceiling out of this game's league. If i wasn't so invested in this game. I would of quit back in 2012 before I got addicted to the illusion of progressive that only this game can offer so frequently. This isn't a game it's a sport. It's not fun. You're not a legend unless you can play in master league in the first year of playing. If you can't hit this peak in skill. There is absolutely no point in playing even if you like this game. Your holding back the potential you have as a human being too evolve. Also the company who owns this game happens to be the richest game corporation in communist China. They also are currently putting there final touches on a system that punishes free speaking chinese people by monitoring online activity directly restricts rights and imposes a natural inconveniece of lifestyle. Tldr; This game is the epitome of Evil"All games are determined who draws the 3 good players and 7 retards" - Dunkey 2015 - Peaked at Diamond IV in season 5- Wasted 1300$ on Cosmetics/Accounts (After getting banned 3 times)- 1200 Reports (according to riot support) across 3 banned accounts,5,A good game severely crippled by it's community. When I and other users say that League of Legends (LoL) has the one of the worst community to ever exist we're not exaggerating.

The sheer amount of raging abuse and trolling from other players is staggering. The problem stems from LoL being a VERY competetive game where you have to rely on 4 random players to fulfill certain roles and complete certain objectives it's a recipe for a bad community. Because of how team oriented LoL is solo queue can be an exercise is frustration simply because alot of games can boil down to which team has the most incompentant players trolls feeders AFK'ers etc thus skill not really playing a major part in the outcome of many games. The gameplay can be fun and addicting with plenty of champions to play that keep things fresh. Unfortunately with the vast amount of champions in the game some are blatantly overpowered and some are just not viable at all in the current meta. Overall LoL has too many issues to be considered a great game with the community being the largest issue.,1,The game itself was very fun and addicting but the terrible rules and community ruin things.

I barely knew what I was doing for a really long time ( tutorial sucked back then) and on top of that there are some toxic kids that could ruin your whole experience when you just start out. As i progressed onto ranked it starting becoming more serious for me to play and I actually had a better time playing it to be "ranked" into different divisions across your server. The only bad things i've experienced from then on out is just the trolls afk's toxic people but at the moment it's definitely gotten better :D. As you get better at the game in ranked you start to get way less of those people luckily. Plus Riot games actually does care a lot about shaping the community which is a big part of leagueand   does a fair job balancing all the champions and making the game easily enjoyable when you don't have to put a single dime into playing it.,9,Most of the reviews here are just flat outdated.

It is a little rough around the edges right now and balance needs some work but its a free game! So I definitely recommend checking it out. Riot is one of the best developers I've ever seen they respond to a ton of feedback and get stuff fixed quickly.,10,Among free titles this is truly the best.

I have played a lot of free to play games over the years and I find one flaw in most all of them - Pay money to win. This is the ONLY game I have seen that paying real money into the game does not mean winning or being over balanced. Anything that is of importance in the way of "getting the edge on the competition" can be gotten with by playing the game in the free sense. I have not spent a penny on this game and I have never run into someone who can pay their way to victory. Unlike some of the other "free" games this actually makes me want to spend money to buy skins or whatever. If you like this type of game (which I find difficulty placing other than an RPG/Competitve game) then this is your game. Do not hesitate to download this game. Shout out to Riot Games for such an amazing display of amazing game fairness. I am not a big "Graphics! Graphics! Graphics!" person but I do enjoy turning my computers graphics up to it's full potential when I can. This game is visually pleasing. It's graphic are very good for all the it entails. I like the graphics of the game personally but it's no FPS detail graphics game when you break it down. The graphics are a bit childish when you play it but your view of the game being childish changes when you see a Cho'Gath feasting on another character...yes that is blood not katchup. The animation for the movements are very fitting. The only complaint that I have heard from anyone about the movements is that the characters do not turn around they just move. But hey it doesn't bother me.When I play video games I go to options>sounds and turn off the music. I can't tell you how good the music is but I have not heard any complaints. I do know however that the game sound fit the environment and that the taunts and jokes the characters say can be very funny. I know the action sounds good (to me) and thats all I can tell you.If you want to try this game use this link. It'll give me a referral.

The graphics aren't the best but they do not detract for the gameplay and Riot Games is currently working to update the graphics later on. However the graphics and the UI are very clear-cut do a great job in making everything in the game visually easy to understand. LoL also has an excellent pay model allowing users to purchase champions and cosmetic skins with actual cash while still allowing said champions to be purchased through earned in-game currency and keeping anything that can affect actual gameplay (runes) obtainable through in-game currency only. Riot Games also releases updates and adds new champions on a biweekly basis to keep the game balanced to the best of their ability. Riot Games interacts well with its userbase and listens to community feedback to prioritize balance issues. League of Legends is a worthy DotA successor and is definitely worth trying out.,10,Incredible game far superior to any other MOBA on the market at the moment. Graphically it is dated for those of you who have seen any of the DotA 2 Gamescom competition footage League is by far not the prettiest game out there. However it does easily outshine Heroes of Neweth graphically. It is suffice to say that LoL's graphics suffice and the cartoony bright style works well andIncredible game far superior to any other MOBA on the market at the moment. Graphically it is dated for those of you who have seen any of the DotA 2 Gamescom competition footage League is by far not the prettiest game out there. However it does easily outshine Heroes of Neweth graphically. It is suffice to say that LoL's graphics suffice and the cartoony bright style works well and character models and skins are all very well rendered. Gameplay wise there are few game modes 5v5 3v3 and then bot ranked and custom modes. While there are functionally only two playable maps; Summoners Rift (either Autumn or Spring skinned Winter skinned at Christmas time) or Twisted Treeline (no skins for this map) the addition of added game rules adds longevity and the existence of both beginner and intermediate bots provides an excellent training ground for new players or even old players who seek to try new builds in a non-competitive environment.Which brings us to the community LoL unfortunately is beginning to suffer from aggro-creep not at all dissimilar to what infects the HoN community. While all new players begin at level one and through playing games acquire in game currency (which can be spent on a number of things in the store) one can chart the level of a player according to behaviour the closer to 30 a player seems to get the more intolerant of mistakes they become in their team mates and themselves with losses often getting a curt GG or silence.The developer though attempts to regulate this behaviour by providing a report function in which any aggrieved player can report other players who have caused problems or been antisocial and a highly motivated player support team on the part of the developer reviews these game logs and hands out bans or cautions appropriately. In fact so vigilant are these guardians of propriety that the LoL community should be more accurately described as 'Passive Aggressive' with the majority of players often settling for curt snarky comments out of fear of the ban hammer. Regardless it helps prevent the rise of the trolling culture found in many other competitive games like CoD HoN Halo etc.Gameplay wise the development team is constantly tweaking heroes attempting to find just the right balance for gameplay this doesn't always work but as it is a never-ending process it doesn't really matter except in extreme cases (like Evelynn). Otherwise the game is a very much tweaked version of the original DotA and the average game lasts anywhere from 20-90 mins (in extreme cases) with the option for either team to surrender after the 20min mark.This game is free to play but you must pay real currency to obtain skins for champions - functionally just a vanity item. I would (and have) recommended this game to anyone with a love of deep strategy and skill it far exceeds anything else on the market currently and in all likelihood will continue to shiny brightly even when DotA 2 releases.,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        I've been playing this game since early preseason 1. This game has evolved tremendously and the producers deeply care about the community. The game is more teamwork oriented then other games of its nature but it is also possible for a person to win the entire game.  Despite the forum posts about how "overpowered" a champion is the game is insanely balanced. Allowing a draft-mode normal and custom match system has produced a practice system for new players. The game interface is extremely user-friendly and simple to figure out. The tutorial is also fairly thorough about gameplay along with the free champion rotations allowing you a diverse number of people to attempt to play. The game is constantly recieving updates to remain balanced and introduce new champions to play. Also riot is a very community oriented company despite people believing it is trying to maximize revenue. Any money spent would not produce a significant advantage to gameplay so you can not buy power in this game.,10,I love gameplay fast and fun. it's free to play and if you want you can shop skins for heroes. you can use a lot of heroes for free. Graphics is ok. League of Legends is an amazing game similar Dota.,9,Probably the best DotA style game out there. It keeps everything relatively simple and adds some exciting additions such as masteries and gems. (My account is lvl 30). However the developers often make some really dumb mistakes.

It keeps everything relatively simple and adds some exciting additions such as masteries and gems. (My account is lvl 30). However the developers often make some really dumb mistakes. For example - there is a new champion every 2 weeks. There is already an absolutely huge amount of champions and adding more at such a fast rate forces you to keep playing or get lost with patches and new champions (like World of WarCraft). The devs always change things that dramatically change the game. If you take a 3 month break you'll come back to a different game. This rapid champ addition makes it really hard for new players to become familiar with the game even after its confusing mechanics. If you can deal with the very large learning curve then LoL becomes a really fun game. I highly recommend it.,10,Some critics need need to re-review this game. I've been playing League of Legends since May 2010 and this game has been completely transformed since then. The developers keep the game updated regularly with patches coming out every two weeks to add new content and address bugs and other problems with the game. I highly suggest you try this game out.,10,League of Legends is a brilliant MOBA that makes you cooperate with your teammates to defeat the enemy team. Free to play endless fun a lot of heroes great balance and also one of the most popular games right now. You can spend your money to insta-unlock the heroes or to buy them beautiful and artistic skins.,6,A co-worker of mine introduced this game to me.  For the first few days I was hooked.

It's a real shame this isn't managed a little better.,7,League of legends is a successor/clone of Defense of the Ancients mod for Warcraft 3. the gameplay is much easy to understand than any other DOTA clones making it easier to play.--------------------------------------------The main criticism isnt towards the gameplay but rather to the Economy of the game.

Each weak 10 champions are "randomly" selected for players to use who havent purchased. Then each of the characters has to be purchased either using Cash converted to the non-refundable ingame Premium Currency or through the ingame "free" currency that you acquire through play.Neither is a good option as the Premium currency is roughly $5-20 per item and with the 100+ characters and skin changes it costs HUNDREDS of dollars to acquire everything. The "free" currency is gained very slowly and cant purchase the skin changes for the characters. the Majority of characters take between fifty and 100 games played with each game taking 30 minutes to an hour to complete.The developers regularly have discounts on certain items paid with Premium Currency have only recently made any kind of price reduction for non-cash players on some champions and then only the oldest. They are making 2 new champions each month at around $9-10 each.Constant changes to the characters abilities make some near impotent in terms of gameplay until another change comes out restoring them to fighting shape.-----------------------Overall the developers and business managers of the game seem to hate their audience regularly abusing the users. Expensive virtual rewards tedious "grinding" as an alternative and constant depreciation of items people pay money or time for are what to expect.If you play this game I hope you enjoy it but bring your credit card.,6,This game is really easy to learn compared to other "DotA-like" games. The game is more chance than skill based which destroys the game experience for me directly. Manipulating games outside of the real gameplay with masteries and runes and expensive Heroes destroys the game for me.I don't think that this game has a capability of being played in e-sports since the games are not 100% even.,10,This is by far my favorite game and is competitive and extremely  fun but Ill be the first to say its not for everyone. It takes a long time to learn how to play the game but when you do it is the most rewarding and satisfying experience.,5,This game is just too simple. Riot has refused to allow champions to have good ults. Champions like shen and Twisted fate got nerfed just because they had global ults.

The game is fun to play with friends and is a blast if you decide to play it competitively thanks to ranked que. Yes the games community can be frustrating but that is not from the games fault.  The amount of hours I have played on this game is insane and the best thing? Its free!,0,Absolutely fantastic game ruined by the community.  So many toxic players and trolls its unbelievable.  The ranking system is an absolute joke and does not reward players for skill but rather luck.  Find something else to play.  I would give the game an 8 or 9 rating but can't with due to the community.  It is horrible and completely ruins the experience.,10,This game contains more than a hundred different heroes 4 very different maps and a horrible community. The game itself is amazing. It's really well made and the champions are unique and most of them are fun to play. The only problem with this game is that most players act like retards. But as long as you just mute the scumbags you will love it.,9,The game is a lot of fun and super addictive. The game is now super vast with over 100 different characters to play as. Riot continues to update and revise the game frequently especially when one of the characters is over powered.The game is great and really competitive (its also free) so why not try it out?,0,Yeah almost half the reviews are negative... This game is fun but serious a POS.... If you're going to make a game make it multi platform... I am so sick of it crashing on Mac it's ridiculous...

Without having full masteries runes and good selection of champs you can't really win your game.  Toxic community also.  Duh. It was a star game but now Heroes of the Storm is going to take it out.,10,This is one of the best games I've ever played in my entire 30 year gaming life. It's a action/shooter/strategic multiplayer-mixed-genre game. I've played LOL 4 years since it launced 2011. I'm not interested in the rift anymore. but I still play the abyss somtimes. Again LOL is the one of the best game for the entire gaming history like WOW COD4.,0,League of Legends does one thing right: cloning the early laning phase of Dota.

In comparison to others of the genre League of Legends falls behind in lots of categories. Go play Dota 2 It's a lot tougher; but a much better game than this piece of trash.,10,I play this game now for a long time and it is still  the best online games i've ever played and I'm sure that I will play this game for the next 5 years,10,I love this game - haven't spent so many hours playing a game since WOW first came out. Hugely replayable and extremely fun.,9,I've been playing League of Legends since August or September 2010.The game is addictive as hell and it now has tons of champions about 80 or so. What makes this game different (and imo better) than the original DOTA is the new mechanics they've put in the game such as summoner spells runes masteries which all allows you to customize your character even before the game startsI've been playing League of Legends since August or September 2010.The game is addictive as hell and it now has tons of champions about 80 or so. What makes this game different (and imo better) than the original DOTA is the new mechanics they've put in the game such as summoner spells runes masteries which all allows you to customize your character even before the game starts allowing players to create their own way of playing certain champions.Furthermore it keeps the player addicted since you want more champions you need runes to be as efficient as others etc. This is not a bad thing in my opinion it gives you a goal when playing. And now they are coming up with a new map and they are actually getting way better at balancing the game so it is more enjoyable. Overall I find the game to be quite fantastic given it is a F2P game ^^,10,Very good game a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA).

Awesome music. Great leveling system. Currently the best moba on the market.,10,Perfect simply perfect. The guys from DoTA really outdid themselves on this one and it shows exactly how much they were aware of in the industry and the fan base when they laid this thing out.The graphics are exactly as they should be slightly cartoony but they make low-res look good.

The entire feel of the interface the characters the animations and particles all of them fit into exactly what you'd think of for a game like this. The characters feel like toons which is exactly what they are your own personal disposable soldiers. The gameplay is spot on not a single beat missed anywhere. The action is easy to get into and yet still engaging several hundred hours in. The developers are very in-tune with the players paying a lot of attention to their concerns and fostering the first real competitive online game. This one is an instant classic.Being free to play in this context isn't a bad thing. The fundamental concept of the game every match being a clean slate full of level 1 players is such an even and refreshing experience that being a "free" player versus being someone who has dropped hundreds of dollars into the game doesn't tilt the power balance too far and the makers of the game intend it to be that way. It's completely brilliant on their part.The only issues I lament right now are the lack of follow-through on the in game reporting system for players out there to ruin the experience but with such a massive player base I can't fault them for not being able to handle the hundreds of thousands of reports they get daily. The lack of maps is another issue I hear complained about frequently but I personally don't mind it although a new map is finally being released Q3 this year.Ultimately I can't say anything but good about this game it's #1 on my game selection from the day I started it up.,10,this is a really really fun game. It's multiplayer only so it's rough if you expect to learn in single player but it's a lot easier to get into than DOTA and its a lot less punishing in feel with a much nicer community. Supposedly its very competitive too. I like the faster pace and greater emphasis on team combat compared to DOTA.,0,Graphic in Dota 2 is much better heroes in Dota 2 are much better community in Dota 2 is much better.Why are you playing this game Dota 2 is much better,8,This is a very very well done game.

While some of the features on the game are somewhat confusing to the leisure gamer if you spend the time to fully explore everything beneath the surface you'll find a world of customization at your fingertips.,9,For those who feel the need to compare LoL with DotA this game definitely trumps that. Teamwork the right in-game build and the right meta build all contribute to a very strategic gameplay. The fact that there's such a huge playerbase only adds to the fun though I'd highly recommend playing with friends who know what they're doing over playing random queues.

After trying to re-queue I received the error message that ranked was disabled due to latency issues.,10,League of Legends is a wonderful game with a free-to-play option. If you try it and find out you do not like it fortunately you didn't have to sacrifice anything but your bandwidth to try it out. It is not a game you can just pick up and expect to be good at. Riot releases new champs frequently and constantly patches to create balances and change the gameplay style up a bit.,8,Superb addictive sociable and fiendishly deep PvP gameplay mechanics flawed by terrible server issues (in Europe at least) game droppers abusive and cynical community and a buggy engine.

No it was not those mountain of reasons why I ultimately quit the game. Surprising no? The reason why I ultimately quit the game was in soloq my personal experience with the awful atrocious horrendous grotesque abysmal disgusting cancerous malignant vomit-inducing wretched abomination that they call the match making system and the incompetent ape-like borderline retarded people that would have the audacity to put such a system out there call it "match making" and not feel the deepest soul-crushing shame to the point of suicidal thoughts as a result of the job they did. THAT is what made me give up on the game. When it got to the point where 95% of my soloq matches in blind draft even aram eventually became the epitome of what I would call "horribly not-fun" THAT is why I quit this god awful game and you should too or at least NOT consider playing it. ALL the money you spend ALL the time and effort you spend is basically wasted unless maybe you can get to the very high tier such as master where I see people have to wait 5+ minutes for a game plenty of times. Are you ready to sink that amount of time effort and money to maybe have a chance at a decently enjoyable playing experience more then maybe half the time? Then try this game out. Answer this question: Is a 50% win rate really a 50 win rate if you have to bust your balls and "scrape dog meat off the streets to survive" type of effort into every blood sweat and tears game that you win every small win steak that you gave yourself heart palpitations to achieve just to have IT ALL WIPED OUT by a string of games that happens more often then your win streaks given to you by the matchmaking where you have quitters afks laggers/dc's horribly toxic aholes completely screwed up matchups lopsided skill/ranking matchups (I had bronzes and silvers on my team vs golds and plats as an example) and it seems to get more and more constant the more time and money you put into the game? As a sort of "F YOU" to you for spending time and money on their game compliments riot? If you like the sound of that give this game a try! Otherwise avoid this game like it is cancer aids and ebola combined. Go over to Dota 2 enjoy having the  full compliment of heroes available so your money is spent on aesthetics as it should be know that you have an at least half-competent game design and development company on your side so you wont be screwed by horrible balance horrible designs horrible metas and meta shifts horrible matchmaking horrible servers etc. etc. I could go on and on. Just save yourself so you don't end up down $100 and a bucket-load of sanity like me.,0,I've played this game for over a year with 750 hours+ involved.

The game itself gets boring quickly one game tends to be easily 40+ minutes. It severely lacks maps and other game modes as well. The updates come quick but are often new characters nothing really special. I'd seriously like to see some balancing as well a big batch of characters are far too powerful. Overall it's great. You'll have a MUCH better experience with LoL if your playing with a friend or if you've played strategy games in the past.

I also wish there was a way to punish people who you play with and against for trolling and raging. For example maybe a player reveiw score for players. That way you can lower there score if they troll using things like player in game quoting for advanced features. Just right now there isn't a good way to defend yourself against ragers. I cant just NOT play with them like in real life since its all based on random solo queuing. Though this does promote a environment where people who can tolerate the different ways of abuse and frustration can excel even without mechanical skill. TLDR: 1 Make a way to defend yourself from random ragers. 2 Love the champion variety and complexity. 3 Wish there was more ability to make up for bad team comp or that team comp wasn't as important.,10,Fun game. They need to rework some champions because they get outdated when new ones are released but many fun unique gamemodes. No OP cash shop items.

The graphics aren't the greatest but with particles being recently updated on a lot of champions some slower computers might not be able to render high def particles at every ability cast. The developers (RIOT) are constantly working on not only patches and balance fixes but fun optional bonus content as well and their servers albeit not the most reliable do hold up most of the time. Some people say that this is a pay to win game despite the fact that 10 champs are free every week and every week the 10 free champ change. IMO that's great because you not only gain skill in every kind of champion due to the lack of your starting champion pool but you also find out which champions you like and which to strive to unlock permanently as your favorites. The community can be toxic at times but as with every MMO there's always going to be picking on people who are less skilled or simply less experienced than others. Overall it's a solid game and with well over 100 champions to choose from RIOT has come a long way from it's roots. Would defiantly recommend trying and if you don't like it then no harm done because the game itself costs nothing.,1,I have played both League of Legends and Dota 2. They have similar "plots" and the gameplay is very similar but I believe Dota 2 to be superior in nearly every way; the graphics soounds character diversity etc. There too much going on at any time in LoL for me to really like how it looks.,5,Worst game I have ever played becasue of it's unbalanced gameplay and horrible community. I expected that it will be better at higher ranks (like platinum and above) but surprisingly it's not better.

It is basically a spin-off of Dota that uses cell shaded/anime style graphics for the characters. The gameplay is very similar to Dota and emphasizes teamwork and communication. It's a game really easy to pick up but difficult to master as you will need a thorough understanding of all the characters to be considered an expert at the game. This is all the more difficult since the developers are constantly pumping out new characters and implementing character balances approximately every 2 weeks. The game is in a desperate need of new maps. There are currently 3 maps: Summoner's Rift Twisted Treeline and the Crystal Scar. I never really understood why the developers kept building new characters to use instead of making new maps simply because all the Dota related games follow the format of adding new heroes/champions/characters. Different game modes would also be good. The newest Crystal Scar map is a step in the right direction. I think this game will continue to develop into a better and better game over time. (Overall: 7+ lots of potential to be a 10),8,League of Legends is possibly one of the fastest growing MMOs out on the market right now.  the game plays like DOTA (basically Tower Defense+World of Warcraft's battlegrounds in third-person over the top view).

You start out the game only using the free to play champions which switch every week then as you play more games level up and gather IP (in game currency) you can afford to buy the champs that appeal to you the most. The game features some of the most strategic and cooperative gameplay on the market featuring 5v5 3v3 normal and draft modes (banning champs strategic team compositions ect) as well as 3v3 and 5v5 ranked game modes which can be accessed once reaching the highest level (level 30).  Reaching top level will take you on average of about a months worth of play and unlocking runes building mastery pages and buying champions will take you even longer.  One of the most fun and addicting games out now definitely has a learning curve (which isn't bad) and has potential to be one of the better or best MMO on the market.,5,Having played both this and Dota 2 (I am yet to dabble into HoN) this game by far strikes me as the simpler and less enjoyable game. Heroes cost an arseload to buy unless you plan on slamming all your time into this game in which case you should have collected your final hero by about 2030 (assuming 24/7 playtime factoring in hero additions).

Most heroes are very similar stun skillshot bla bla bla (most skills can be found with a word for word replica on Dota) and they mostly look like pansy fairies. Some of the big mechanics of Dota have been removed ability to carve your own path through the jungle courier losing gold upon death and denying spring to mind (if anybody asks 'why does killing your own creeps give you an advantage' please tell me you aren't questioning realism in a game full of monsters hurling fireballs at each other). Also in LoL you can usually just spam spells due to high mana pools and low spell costs and recharge whereas in Dota you need to think about when you want to use them. LoL's item shop does have a much greater variety of items though which is nice. Good fun to play with a group of friends preferably 9 friends so you can 5v5 each other and never ever have to come into contact with the vile 12 year old insult spewing community. Dota does have its fair share of that but it's everygame in LoL and only on occasion in Dota. I occasionally retreat back to it when I've had some tough losses on Dota and fancy an easy couple of wins. Much easier to play than Dota which is good and bad depending on how you look at it (in Dota LoL player is an insult. In LoL the opposite is not true).My first LoL game I went 12-2 as Warwick playing in a game of level 20-30's playing with my level 30 friends. My friend came to Dota went 1-5 as Sand King after 15 minutes and rage quit. An average Dota player will be better at LoL I won't talk about the graphics because graphics don't define a game (Baldur's Gate 2 anyone?).The paying side of Dota is much more kind and its easier to stay F2P with it. 90% (if not 100%) of items in Dota can be found as drops (some admittedly incredibly rare) and all items are purely cosmetic starting all players on level ground at the start of a game. LoL has skins (effectively a less customisable version of Dota's items) which require real money to purchase and levels and runes can put players at an advantage to others if a player has a full rune set bought with real money he will be statistically better than one who is yet to earn his set through playtime (runes can be bought with money or ingame points).Also Dota makes all characters available giving much more variety to the game than LoL's slow IP system. If you're looking for a challenge or don't have friends to play with play Dota.If you're just starting MOBA's looking for a pushover or have 9 friends to play with so you never have to venture into the community play LoL.But you really should try both. tl;dr LoL  more pay to win easier more repulsive community get annoyed at others.Dota  more variety hardcore get annoyed with yourself.,9,It's free..... its freee.... its balanced.... its fun.... ITS FREEE..... oh yeah did I say its free?Its also fun but its better to have a group of friends to play with.,9,Very good game only thing holding it back is us. The people who play the game. Community is good and nice but also it´s very toxic and immature. But after all. Most people have spent very long time over internet and realized that anonymity can equal bad behavior. I don´t hold riot games for that. Graphics are good i´d even say for an moba game they are very good. Champion pool is veryVery good game only thing holding it back is us.

Most people have spent very long time over internet and realized that anonymity can equal bad behavior. I don´t hold riot games for that. Graphics are good i´d even say for an moba game they are very good. Champion pool is very solid and creativity is the key. Some hardcore dota fan´s believe Dota 2 is only game worth playing because it was made by the author. League of Legends was made by person who made most popular variation of Dota. Dota all-stars. For a person who has played all "competive" Moba games out there league of legends is only one that actually counts.This game is very easy to start. Make an account download client download game with client update and fire it up. Game itself is very easy to learn but it´s impossible to master. You can make mistakes you can lose you can get better you have a choice to play this game for free without being in handicap position. You can pay for gadgets but it´s not must and paying for anything in this game does not make you better. I give this game 9. For overall layout for Riot games who treats their customers (Both ones who pay and who doesn´t pay) like they would own the game. They do think the players not just wallets. Most of all i give this game 9 because it´s awesome game. I don´t take points because part of community sucks. If i did well all games that requires connection with other people  would be deemed bad.,9,League of Legends is fast paced and extremely addictive. There are the constant comparisons made to DOTA DOTA 2 or HON but LoL is different enough from the other games that it should be considered on its own merit. One of the most attractive aspects of the game is that it is totally free. If you put in the time playing you can earn enough IP to purchase any item champion in the game.League of Legends is fast paced and extremely addictive.

One of the most attractive aspects of the game is that it is totally free. If you put in the time playing you can earn enough IP to purchase any item champion in the game. Every week a new selection from all of the available champions are available for free play which gives you an opportunity to try them out before spending your hard earned IP. The longest wait time I have experienced for a matched game is about 6 seconds and that is at any hour of the day. If you are looking for a fun game that will cost nothing but the time to download this might be for you.,7,Fun game unique characters for the most part graphics are what you'd expect from a dota/hon type game. A game you can easily pick up and put down at the same time with no real problems. The downside? I guess the lack of support for banning people who actually need it is definitely a problem if the abysmal community doesn't already irritate you to the ends of the earth.

There are also WAY too many characters. So many in fact that some abilities on one character are found on another. In any case its a fun game worth trying. But if you didn't like Hon/Dota before you're probably not going to like this.,7,it's a great game it just lacks a couple of things one a tutorial cause starting on your own without friends to guide you is a suicide run and very time consuming. two no microphones League of Legends updates regularly and they keep adding newer characters. but they really need to add a mic system being in a game where at a certain time you need to run for your life.

What really makes this game fun is playing with 4 of your friends as you take down the enemy team. If you're not a team player sort of person then don't touch this game. The game is constantly updated new heroes are added every few weeks and glitches are fixed.

There is also a match making system which allows you to play with people of your own level so that a new comer won't get their asses handed to them by casual players. The graphic aren't anything to brag about but it certainly works for this type of game.

The game play is terribly addicting and wonderfully exhausting the end of each game needs a well earned cool off period however with matches being fairly lengthy this is not a game you can have a quick match on.The graphic style I personally findMOBA (Dota) style games are rapidly becoming popular after playing several League of Legends (LoL) is the title that sticks out for me. The game play is terribly addicting and wonderfully exhausting the end of each game needs a well earned cool off period however with matches being fairly lengthy this is not a game you can have a quick match on.The graphic style I personally find quite charming. The simple textures and bright colours allow for a wide range of PC's to run LoL with no problem and still look great providing you don't zoom in too far. The detail of the maps is good and there no characters that I feel were given less attention visually.Match making is simple and easy you can join solo games with complete strangers that are of a similar  level or you and any number of friends can team up in 5v5 and 3v3. Your progression as a gamer increases over time with each win and loss contributing to your summoner level a higher summoner level gives you more access to customisation options and buffs for your character although this means that people higher than your level will be undoubtedly stronger than you in more ways than one.LoL is a brilliant and addicting game but it has it's problems. The biggest complaint for myself and the biggest complaint many people will present is that the community is extremely hostile. Every player seems to be either brilliant at the game but a horrible person or very bad at the game and lovely. There seems to be no middle ground of players you either rule or suck.Another Problem I have is that although the game offers a huge and diverse selection of characters there is very little selection of maps. With 2 main maps a 5v5 (Summoners Rift) and 3v3 (Twisted Treeline) There is colour swapped version of the 5v5 and a special tutorial level that is very small but other than that there is very little variety. The game is well worth checking out for anyone interested in the genre. And as it's free you have nothing to lose with no obligation to pay. However be prepared for a very unforgiving environment  and to have summoners rift burned into your eye balls.,9,bloody addictive in a great way. as long as you get a good team its about as much fun as you can get. for a newbie to moba games this is a definate first pick.,8,Great Game but it has 2 main LacksThe first lack is the balancing. There are about 90 champs now and the more champs riot makes the harder it becomes to balance the game. but they are already releasing new champions instead of focus on balancingthe second thing is the lack of maps (3),9,this game is so well mad that i gave its a 9. super close to 100% perfect. its like 9.5. so good that it is one of my favorite games. its fun well made good updates frequent updates popular and isnt hard to play on my computer. and best of all its free! how could you reject this game. it sounds like all of the other MOBA game fans played it just to find faults because their problemthis game is so well mad that i gave its a 9. super close to 100% perfect. its like 9.5. so good that it is one of my favorite games. its fun well made good updates frequent updates popular and isnt hard to play on my computer. and best of all its free! how could you reject this game. it sounds like all of the other MOBA game fans played it just to find faults because their problem are exaggerated and easily fixable. Bad graphics? get a better computer because you are on low settings. otherwise you are comparing them to Dota and even still they are at least good. a champion is underpowered or overpowered? they make it on purpose for some champions to be worse. those are for the better players. the cheap champions are for more noobish players. and in the end that sometimes doesn't even matter it all depends on the difficuly of mastering a champion and how good a player is. and if a pro is playing tryndamere then you should be pro enough to the point that it doesnt matter too much from there on it is just skill. and by the way champs like taric arent mainly to battle. i saw something about buy to win and i facepalmed. you buy skins. SKINS. doesnt make a difference in gameplay. runes are ip only and if you are talking about champ then just stop being lazy and get some ip. 3 maps is by far enough in my opinion. and dont hate the game because of a bad community. i dont know about other moba games but lol is pretty awesome.,10,As a game it is incredibly fun numerous improvements have been made to it after release its microtrnsaction model is successful in not skewing the balance of the game.The game is very stable rarely crashes and has a good framerate and artstyle how it lacks the graphical punch of HoN of the upcoming DOTA 2.

However I see this as an advantage making it rather clear who is damaging who the spells and abilities being cast etc etc.This game also receives updates every 2 weeks and normally its a new champion or a rebalance but sometimes they come out with a huge patch.It is fun somewhat balanced and easy to get into with the friendliest community you can get from a MOBA game. Riot games has achieved a great community which create great fan art and machinima.I would give this a 9 but the negative reviews are very scathing and do not include much reasons for their apathy for the game. Nothing but trolls with a very skewed viewpoints.,9,Fun and addictive this game will eat up a lot of your time. Only drawback is that there are quite a few unbalanced issues in the game. Riot games has been fixing up these issues quite frequently but some champions it seems that riot games favour too much and does not want to nerf making it frustrating for players to see the same champions in every match due to their "op" stance.,10,This is the new king of MOBAS and will remain so for many years to come. The game always gets updated regularly and the devs are the best out there. They always interact with the community and give the players what they want. There is also a bunch of tournament and an enormous e-sport scene for this game which makes it all that much exciting and fun to watch and play.,7,This game is really good and works well overall.  On reputation it is perhaps the best game in the MOBA genre although I can't say that I've played any others.  I can say though that League of Legends is really fun.  The main problem with the game for me is the fact that the heroes are horribly unbalanced and obviously so.

The main problem with the game for me is the fact that the heroes are horribly unbalanced and obviously so.  Combined with the fact that you often end up on or against a terrible team (especially if you solo queue) and yeah many games are just horrible and a waste of time.  Still this game is good enough and has sufficient depth to it that I think it is well worth trying out.,9,League of legends is a great first MOBA for new players looking to get into the game genre. It is balanced to a very good extent to my personal opinion. It has frequent updates and Riot Games frequently mixes with their community and talks with them.The Game in a  graphical standpoint is relatively weaker than it's competitor DOTA 2 but has it's own style runs smoothly and showsLeague of legends is a great first MOBA for new players looking to get into the game genre.

Riot frequently updates older models and works towards a better game.Balancing is frequently done and riot listens to players to an extent. They slowly but surely work towards scaling down or buffing the champions in need. Often players complain about the "OP" champions but that is generally hype or lack of counter knowledge. Riot can be slow with updates and this gets frustrating for some players. Many newer players get easily beaten by the stronger champions who only have counters like team coordination and crowd control which newer players lack.The latency and connection issues very infrequently occur and when they do they are often fixed quickly. The game is free to play to an extent and the shop is well run with a endgame based on rune collection though it is pretty shallow. It is very expensive to buy skins in league $10 each is the standard cost but the cost can be brought down by larger purchases (ironic as that is).I would recommend this game to newer players of the genre to get used to last hitting and team mechanics.The MAIN down point of this game is that the general attitude towards other players is very negative and trolls and unskilled players (Who the inadequate matchmaking system pairs you with) frequent the game and disconnection is rife.,7,Addicitve and extremely fun when matchmaking works. Probably the most fun I have had in anything PVP. Simpler than similiar games (like DoTA HoN) but still very deep. It is truly free to play (you can buy everything but you can use in game currency for everything but additional skins).However matchmaking works maybe 50% of the time. Sometimes a week can go inbetween close games. FewAddicitve and extremely fun when matchmaking works. Probably the most fun I have had in anything PVP.

Graphics when compared to DoTA 2 are bad. Balancing of the game is very uneven (especially since a new character gets introduced every 2 weeks).,9,One of the most addicting PC games currently popular League has an active professional scene and support from the developers to constantly improve the gameplay  experience.  The high learning curve may intimidate new players as the tutorial fails to explain key aspects of gameplay. Nevertheless the is a standout that no PC gamers should miss,9,Disclaimer: Long read you've been warnedI have played this game over extensively and can safely say that I know the game inside and out.

I've been playing it for 2 years now and have over 1000 games (which sadly equates to about a month of ACTUAL PLAY time). Thus I can adequately explain the ins and outs the pros and cons of the game. Starting with what makes the game great is the overall re-playability value. Anyone that greatly enjoys this game will be able to play it for years because of the constantly changing variety of characters and  play style. Characters can be played a multitude of different ways with each having their own personalized charm. Some characters are downright hilarious with how they work in game and I can't help but laugh even after playing them for the 50th time. It is a completely free game in that any aspects of getting a "head start" do not exist no matter how much money you spend on it getting purely aesthetic skins. The free champions switch every week to allow players to try out new champions. The in game points are used to purchase champions (permanently) and runes that allow for even further customization of your play style before the game even starts. The gameplay itself is thrilling enough in that I am screaming as I run through the jungle being chased by half the enemy team for my teammates to save me.My favorite part of the game which I'm sure many people overlook or flat out don't have the chance to experience is how well this game can bring a group of people together. This game is a social experience and it has allowed me to socialize with friends that have gone off to colleges in far off places that I don't have the chance to see much of. Playing this game with friends is what makes league of legends one of my favorite games.That being said getting to the cons of the game if you don't have friends to play with this game will not be as appealing to you. Me and my friends often joke about "randoms" being these horrible mindless creatures that are typically out to ruin everything so playing with random people constantly will produce a very inconsistent experience that will probably not be enjoyed.Also the game has a tremendous learning curve such that those who are just starting and have not played RTS or MOBA games before will do terribly and be discouraged because of it. Not to be taken as a light game more on the hardcore side of games.This game also comes under the realm of games that gears itself towards the male gamer audience in that the avatars of the female characters sport skimpy clothing and huge breasts but that's just my philosophical side showing. Overall this game gets a 10 from me based on my excessive love for this game but I am biased in that I have significant circumstances that make my game experience playing this fantastic. This game is not for everyone.,8,The game is one of many games that I was surprised with how much fun it is. The gameplay is complex and takes skill to understand the game. The major downfall is that learning curve is insane. It took me almost 3 weeks to completely understand the game (Towards the middle of season 2). Also some champs in the game are imbalance which annoys me the most. Overall the game is not perfectThe game is one of many games that I was surprised with how much fun it is.

Que times are virtually instant. Good teamwork eithics. 10 all the way,9,Generally fun and good game horrible community though. There's a lot of butthurtt mad and raging in the game. The game is actually pretty balanced for the most part and this game will eat up most of your time. Possibly the most fun you'll have online.,10,I'm playing it for only a few weeks now and only because one of my friends insisted i try it out after bad experience with blizz-DOTA i thought it would be hard for me to like a game type like that but to my greatest surprise after playing a few games i simply couldn't stop... It really does get more and more addictive and entertaining the more you play. I must say even dota 2 startedI'm playing it for only a few weeks now and only because one of my friends insisted i try it out after bad experience with blizz-DOTA i thought it would be hard for me to like a game type like that but to my greatest surprise after playing a few games i simply couldn't stop... It really does get more and more addictive and entertaining the more you play. I must say even dota 2 started to seem a bit more interesting after playing LoL still i sympathize with LoL much more simply cause it has motivations one of the things i enjoy the most is that you actually need to buy your character not have all of them available from the very start...The rune and mastery systems also works for me just great because there is actually a point of leveling your summoner. I do also like the graphics much more then in dota 2 since I'm kinda an anime fan and this style is simply much more enjoyable for me. LoL is also much more newbie-friendly then dota is it's more simple to figure out and not that one-sided even if your getting owned at the start of the game you can actually have a pretty nice comeback and maybe even win after it was quite obviously a lost game in dota that's almost impossible... if you're getting owned  you're getting owned for good. P.S I'm pretty sure most of negative responses come from haters like hardcore dota gamers :P,8,I really like this game. The fast action and easy team ups. Makes this a game you can sit down with for hours. Even solo this game is great though its even better if  you play alongside some of your friends.

It judges player not because of money but because of play time and experience gained by himself. Money gives you additional fun not advantages. Of course RIOT could makes more maps more balanced champions etc. but it's not the point. The biggest pain is community which destoys this game and ELO rating. So effect of this we can see inLoL is the best free to play moba at the moment. It judges player not because of money but because of play time and experience gained by himself.

Well In my opinion it's still not the RIOT fault because they are doing everything they can.,10,League of Legends is a great game is the game I played the most in my entire life (about 5k games) But why is this game so good? This game basicly changes every 2 weeks adds new champions has 4 maps already (thats quite alot for a Moba) and has a great balanced champion pool what i want to say is that there are only a few champs that are totally bad or too good. Try to balance 100+League of Legends is a great game is the game I played the most in my entire life (about 5k games) But why is this game so good? This game basicly changes every 2 weeks adds new champions has 4 maps already (thats quite alot for a Moba) and has a great balanced champion pool what i want to say is that there are only a few champs that are totally bad or too good. Try to balance 100+ champions with different spells and mechanics yourself. The Matchmaking is also very good although I don't know why most people complain here. It's a 5v5 game where 9 other players play there simply can't be a perfect system. One thing that I really hate about LoL and why I gave it a 9 is the toxic community. And now another word to LoL-DotA. Before I played LoL I played DotA alot of times. People say DotA is difficult DotA is balanced and blah blah  DotA is so friggin unbalanced. Unlike LoL there aren't equal lanes. One counters another very hard all the time and you are forced to play passive. Another aspect is the snoballing. The one dieing loses Gold all the time making it very hard to come back into the game so basicly it's nearly impossible to win when you lost 2 lanes. In LoL you can comeback even if you lost all your lanes just by having a good comp or another playstyle. Now to the difficulty. DotA is nowhere more difficult than LoL is. All you have to learn is the time for stupid built-in delay when you move and the items for the shops. And what I really really hate about DotA is the random aspect. X% chance to stun someone on items and heroes Dodge XX-XX damage random runes etc. etc.. I could say pros for DotA aswell but I won't as this review is about LoL and my opinion.,10,I have played this game for a little over two years and I see no sign of stopping anytime soon. This game is so terribly hard to get into but once you become familiar with the mechanics you will love the MOBA franchise forever. +1 with friends. -1 for community. +1 for esports. -1 for teemo.,10,When I played DotA DotA 2 and HoN I didn't think there was any way to improve on it.  This is exactly what Riot did with League of Legends.  Many complain that the game is more casual then the other varieties in the genre yet the game takes just many of the same skills and new varieties of skills to master then the others.

There is something very addicting about the runes and mastery system that I very very much enjoy and there is no other game I'd like to play night after night then League of Legends and perhaps MechWarrior Online as well.,10,Hi everybody League of legends is one of my favorite online game because : The Game is based of Dota a Custom map for Warcraft 3 (made by Ice frog).Its a very cool team game I recommend to play with friends because sometimes the match making is'nt very good.Developers are creating news maps  Like dominions there is place for over 12 news maps.Have fun playing with your friend.Hi everybody League of legends is one of my favorite online game because : The Game is based of Dota a Custom map for Warcraft 3 (made by Ice frog).Its a very cool team game I recommend to play with friends because sometimes the match making is'nt very good.Developers are creating news maps  Like dominions there is place for over 12 news maps.Have fun playing with your friend.It's a F2P game ( Free to play) Everybody can download it and play  You should start the download now :) Thanks for ready,10,This is honestly one of the most addicting games I have ever played its free not pay to win and is very intense. I'm surprised how many people are complaining about the graphics they aren't half bad and as long as a game is great graphics shouldn't make any difference at all.,10,Very nice game easy to learn pretty funny  too many champions etc The servers run good most of time copletely free except if you want skins or boosts. just play and enjoy. solo queue op btw.,6,Balancing issues and lack of full content updates make this game frustrating from time to time Having said that once your time has been put in and you find your champions of choice you can have alot of fun playing long game times with no alternative makes it ill advised for those who want to hop on a game kill some people in the few minutes they may have to play.,9,I reached 1800 elo in season 1 and don't play much anymore but I spend hundreds of hours watching the pros play most recently season 2 world championships. This game is one of the best semi-casual games out there that takes at most 1 hour for a very long game to complete.

Perhaps some champions should be retired. While the game itself great what distinguishes League from the rest is the professional eGaming scene that seems to keep growing. Game on!,8,The game is pretty good but it has a terrible community. Every step you meet a flamer. The graphics are a bit childish. I admire Riot Games for the fact that with the number of characters they managed to keep the balance. Of course there are bugs but the MOBA game does not? Overall I would recommend and I wish you well for the future.,9,I would like to note that this is my review and I hope this is of help to some. I've been playing League of Legends for a good few months now and I'm remarkably pleased with it.

This game has a tough learning curve however once you overcome it I can assure that you will enjoy this game. At first the game may seem incredibly dull and lacks content however with the range of characters and situations I find in I'm strangely engrossed in this game. Personally I recommend playing this with a group of 3 to 5 friends for the maximum entertainment. The game is reasonably balanced and all champions (characters) fit a unique play style. The game also has regular updates to keep the player incised to the game. The game is free yet has a separate real money system from the in game money system. The IG currency can buy most things that real money currency can buy excluding things like skins which are not vital. This game is far from a 'pay to win'. The experience system also stops newer players being mixed with the more experienced players. I have yet to play the 'rival' of this game DOTA 2 but to anyone reading this stick with the game. There is no better feeling than winning on this game.,7,It's free and fun. If you need to kill time without spending money I'd say check it out. If you have a short temper avoid at all costs. The game relies totally on the players. It's all about teamwork and strategy and a great majority of the users take the game extremely seriously and will not hesitate to scream at you for any and all mistakes.,10,This game is under rated at a 7.6 I have been playing this game for 3 years now and almost started playing it as soon as it came out the community have changed entirely and that is the only down point i can give it but that is in every game there is going to be trolls and the persons who commented below me about how oo 6300 ip is ALOT  well bro u havent played for more than a month iThis game is under rated at a 7.6 I have been playing this game for 3 years now and almost started playing it as soon as it came out the community have changed entirely and that is the only down point i can give it but that is in every game there is going to be trolls and the persons who commented below me about how oo 6300 ip is ALOT  well bro u havent played for more than a month i guarantee you that because riot is so cool with giving free IP boosts and even FREE RP on holidays which is awesome  league is one of my most favorite games  ALL CHAMPS ARE BALANCED *if you know how to play*,10,This is one of the deepest games I've played.  5vs5 and m****ive amounts of teamwork is needed.  One player out of position can cost you huge.  There are a lot of aspects of the game yet you only control your one character so its not too overwhelming. With the games depth the negative aspect of it is the learning curve.  You can get a grasp early but it takes months to master.  KnowingThis is one of the deepest games I've played.  5vs5 and m****ive amounts of teamwork is needed.

There are a lot of aspects of the game yet you only control your one character so its not too overwhelming. With the games depth the negative aspect of it is the learning curve.  You can get a grasp early but it takes months to master.  Knowing each champion's abilities gives you a huge edge in fights and their are a lot of champions.  Also there is a lot of items which again takes a long time to learn what they do and which ones to buy. Even outside the game you can tweak your stats to optimize your attacks defense magic which can be quite fun.  Make different builds for different champions. With this games depth it does bring some very p****ionate players.  Some of those players can be straight up **** holes however the game does try to weed those players out.  You can report them you can judge/punish them and they often get banned.  They also try to reward players who are nice to others which has removed a lot of the negative behavior. The game at its core is a DOTA style "moab"  3 lanes with computer unit waves constantly coming out while the players tip the scales.  Turrets to defend objectives in the middle which give you bonuses.  Killing creeps gives you gold to buy powerful items and they also give experience which makes your champion stronger.  It makes for very fun deep play that rewards teamwork and opens up some big plays and team synergy.,9,Best Moba game ever made.Cons: bad client (crushes often on some PCs) not a friendly community if you are bad they will let you know that but you can mute in-game chat so it's ok.Pros: lots of new champs every month lots of streamers you can watch and learn free 2 play most played game in the world they make a lot of interesting changes every season.,10,I have been playing this game since right after beta and I must say I really love it. I played DotA in Warcraft 3 and this is just amazing it also has the biggest eSport. There are about 107 different champion and to master them it takes practice.

As I said I've played since beta which is about 3 years ago and I can master about 10 champions which means i know everything about those champions. You can have so much fun in this game it's ridiculous. The game has implemented a leveling system (1-30) and each time you level up you get a mastery point which you can put in one of the three mastery trees (Offense defense and utility). Utility is more of a support tree because there are a couple of different champion types:Attack Damage CarryAbility Power CarryJunglerTankBruiserPusherSupport And these types are going on different lanes mostly Supports and AD carries are goin the bot lane and AP carries mid bruisers and tank top/jungle. AP carries may go top but at different occasions. It all depends on enemy team. The game is based of takeing the enemy Nexus (main base) anmd there are 3 lanes and a jungle. there are 2 lane turrets in each lane before inhibitor turret and the inhibitor will be taken down after the turret and then you get ultra super-minions. After you have taken down one of the inhibotrs you can then attack the two nexus turrets after both are destroyed you can attack the Nexus. Amazing game.,10,I think League of Legends is one of the best free to play online multiplayer games!First timewhen I just looked at the gameI thought It's a bit weirdbut then I started playingand I just got to say that It's pretty fun!I can't stop playing it!,5,The game is ok but the community is horrible.

I like the dota 2 community better the game is "harder" and therefore the bad players don't play it.Overall i liked the game. A good thing and also a bad thing is that they keep adding new champions. This makes the game harder to balance and most of the new champs are UP or OP. Ofc they fix them after some patches.,10,best thing to play for free and best moba for now also it isn't pay 2 win game new champions almost every week patches and fun mod as dominion and worldwide championship.,10,Many of these reviews are dated this game has changed and added content over the years and is far superior to the original release.

I would say this game is brilliant and successful. They have over 120 champions from which to choose.

It is great fun and one of the best FTP and games in general out there it is not perfect. Some cons are that the community is very harsh which puts off a lot of new players.

While i don't like the community as long as you keep a good attitude amidst their laughable rage it is quite fun to watch how hard some people get mad at the game. (I guess thats kind of a pro). another con is that getting a good and trustworthy team in matchmaking is rare. someone might leave feed or just suck incredibly. But the games where you do end up with good teammates are a lot of fun. TL;DR try it get to level 20 or so and play with your friends.,6,LoL was my first real experience of the MOBA genre and recommended to me by someone I know. I had heard this game was ''supposedly'' more newbie friendly than other MOBA games such as Dota. I've never really played Dota so I can't compare it to that but for someone totally new to this genre there are some definite problems I realized. There's a real problem when you're level 1-5 and yourLoL was my first real experience of the MOBA genre and recommended to me by someone I know. I had heard this game was ''supposedly'' more newbie friendly than other MOBA games such as Dota. I've never really played Dota so I can't compare it to that but for someone totally new to this genre there are some definite problems I realized. There's a real problem when you're level 1-5 and your team is getting dominated by characters with 20+ kills it doesn't happen all the time but when it does it ruins the game every time unless you have a character on your team with the same amount of kills but this should not be happening at all at low levels. So the match making seems quite iffy and sometimes the people playing are terrible I don't mean skill wise since I'd rather have that rather than rude and hateful people. They also threaten to report you for ridiculous reasons such as being afk disconnecting etc. etc. I disconnected one time only to come back with someone saying they reported me even though we had just started the match and I wasn't long but they reported me for something that was totally out of my control. Are you kidding...? They will also threaten to report you for just doing badly so to play pvp in this game is a lot of stress and pressure even more for a newbie. There are a lot of champions but some are more boring or underpowered to use than others and some are overplayed (Caitlyn comes to mind...). There are some definite balance issues though and as others have surely said some Champions that outclass others if they weren't they wouldn't be reworking some of them. There is lag at times and sometimes when there are a lot of players on at once you may have to wait to be able to login anywhere from a few minutes to possibly an hour or longer. Another thing that I assume is in all the other MOBA games too is the ability to be able to ''unlock'' your camera which lets you look around more freely on the map and is not stuck to your character. When I first saw this in the tutorial I thought this was simply a choice of how to play little did I know how wrong that really was. It's pretty much essential to unlock your camera if you wanna do well at all since if you don't everyone else surely is which gives them a clear advantage over players that don't since they can ambush and kill you. In every game play video I've ever seen of someone playing this game they play the exact same way unlocked camera rapidly clicking around and if you don't play that way then you're playing wrong and you'll never really be good at the game so the ''choice'' of having your camera is extremely deceptive I chose not to play with my cam unlocked because I wasn't comfortable with it at all but you will definitely be penalized for choosing comfort over what everyone else is doing. So from what I can tell this isn't really the greatest game for newbies to the genre and maybe the genre as a whole only caters to ''hardcore'' players that have already experienced many other MOBA style games before. It's a shame because it can be kinda fun at times(when the teams are more balanced and you aren't getting steamrolled)and addicting but the nature of this game and games of this genre in general may push a lot of new players or many others away.,7,I wasn't sure what to expect when I was first introduced to League of Legends about a year and a half ago.  At first I thought the play style was bit weird and my brother let me play on his account for a while until I made my own account.  This was my initiation into the MOBA world.  After gaining a lot of experience with MOBAs through League of Legends here is my assessment of the game:I wasn't sure what to expect when I was first introduced to League of Legends about a year and a half ago.  At first I thought the play style was bit weird and my brother let me play on his account for a while until I made my own account.  This was my initiation into the MOBA world.  After gaining a lot of experience with MOBAs through League of Legends here is my assessment of the game: Visuals  Anyone who slams League of Legends because of the graphics should go look up the term "cel-shaded" because that is exactly how the game is supposed to look.  The simpler style of cel-shading allows Riot more free range on the gameplay without being overly taxing on the average gamer's graphics card.  Besides all of that I personally think the graphics give a good presentation.  What I wish Riot would do is update the look of a champion every time the splash art changes.  I see a number of champions who look exactly like their old splash arts even though there are a number of distinct differences between the texture of the sprite and the design of the splash art representing the champion (e.g. Amumu and Ezreal).  I'm keeping in mind the complexity and time required to do so but it still wouldn't hurt to make a few updates to a champion's texture model as their artwork evolves. Gameplay  MOBAs can be difficult to pick up for gamers who are relatively new to action-RTS types of games like League of Legends.  However since Riot designed the game to be more casual than some of its competing games it is more newbie-friendly than most.  The tutorial also points freshmen players in the right direction in terms of basic strategy and the building of items in a particular set. Sound  The sounds of the game are very well-timed except there are some instances where some sound clips play out despite the ability getting interrupted part-way. Ranked  Ever since Riot Games mostly abandoned the Elo system in favor of a new league system.  Instead of having one giant ladder players were divided up in groups and placed in different leagues (complete with five divisions each of varying levels) according to their evaluated skill level.  Frankly the advancement is a joke.  Supposedly the "league points" are divided and distributed based on the team's overall skill level and whether they win or lose.  However in the lower-level leagues it is far easier to lose points than to gain them.  Players on the forums have repeatedly complained about progression slowing to a crawl while penalties are unfairly large for losses.  I'd hate to say it but I agree with them.  It makes no sense to progress through the ranks if progression slows down while ascending the ladder especially so if rewards pay out the bare minimum for wins (i.e. one or two league points) for higher-ranked players while penalties grow abnormally large (e.g. 20-25 points per loss).  Despite the league system still being fairly new it still suffers from the same problem the old Elo-based ladder had: lack of motivation.  Players felt like they weren't progressing on the old ladder due to the large number of players on one ladder.  Even though climbing the ladder is somewhat easier under the new system several hours or days of progress can still be undone with simply one or two losses thus defeating the motivation to progress.  Although Riot's best intentions for the ranked system was meant to encourage solo players the ladders as a whole still favor pre-made teams. Balancing  Balancing the game is tough work.  Just ask the guys at Blizzard Entertainment. :D  But seriously the balancing seems a bit unfair for lower-level players as it appears that the balancing among champions only come by way of internal testing and feedback from the best professional players around the world.  Still it's better than next to no balancing at all (like Heroes of Newerth).  Some champions that many players believe have too much power are either left alone or have superficial nerfs while retaining their overall level of power. Overall League of Legends is one of the best experiences in online gaming that I've had (and sometimes the most rage-inducing frustration but that's eSports for you).  It's not perfect but the game has its merits.  Plus League of Legends boasts the largest number of active players in the world.  Not bad for a computer game that's only been out for less than five years.,9,One of the best free to play games I have ever played which is why I was rather confused to see the state of the user reviews on this site.

So I shall attempt to address some of the issues people have raised1. The claims that this is a pay to win game. This is simply just not the case real money can be used to purchase additional champions or boosts that speed up the gain of ip and summoner xp. Neither of which directly effect in game performance. Summoner level cap is not hard to reach and must only be reached once it more or less provides something of a learning curve for new players and somewhat helps to keep the skill level ranked play at least a little bit higher it also gives access to a mastery point level which do effect gameplay but in terms of percentages you are talking maybe a 5% increase in strength. IP gains are used to purchase runes which do provide in game advantage whilst getting every single rune would take a considerable period of time it does not take very long to get a couple of sets which can be used on any champion quite well.  Runes do offer quite a reasonable advantage I will admit but it is small enough that skill will trump runes every time and are accessible to even a casual no money spending player.The only thing RP(Real life money requiring currency) is used for exclusively is for champion skins which are a purely visual thing and whilst some skins are kind of average looking others rather expensive there is very good range of reasonably priced good looking skins and regular sales cutting 50% off the cost of them. 2. Let us move on to another common complain graphics. I personally find it difficult to play ugly looking games but this is not one. Yes they are not going to compare to Crysis 3 or any other modern first person game but given the zoom level which the game is played at  it looks very pretty and still manages to run quite well on a range of systems. Graphics though are something of personal taste thing though so there is that.3. Balance. Well there is certainly balance issues some champions are stronger then others but I don't find this is particularly correlated to how recently the champion has come out I think riot does a good job at maintaining balance given how great a variety of champions they provide. Even in the case of champions being powerful there is always ways to counter through your own pick or items. If you for some reason cannot deal with a particularly champion each team gets 3 bans which can be used deal with it.4. The community. This is a tough one the league community is pretty toxic for the most part but then so is most of the online gaming community. The biggest issue is League is a team game you are heavily reliant on the other players so having  team mates is rather unpleasant. This is something that can be dealt with though makes friends meet someone who plays well and doesn't seem to be a dick? Add them as a friend play with them. Once you have found at least 1 or 2 people to play with regularly you will find things a lot better.5.No skill required. This is another flat out lie not much more I can say really play the game for more then a few short minutes and that should become clear. Now that I have addressed to the best of my ability the complaints of other I will move on to why I love the game.It has the best microtransaction system I have ever encountered. No money is required to be spent to play the game quite happily nor is an arduous amount of grind required if one does not. Any purchases made feel voluntary not required as in some free to play games they are not shoved in your face too much and just kind of lets you do your thing. The metagame system provides increased depth but does not punish players to harshly for having poor understanding/use of it. Each week 10 champions are made free for the week which allows the trial of many champions before acquiring them permanently with in game earned currency or RP. The leveling system in place means that at higher levels you are guaranteeing that least some understanding of the game even at low skill ratings in ranked. Leaving games is harshly punished(as it should be) and so whilst it does still happen is not nearly as common as in some mobas. The range of champions available is vast some more interesting then others but the sheer range allows for finding of many champions to suit any play style. Most have a good range or item builds that can be used to great effectiveness other are more restricted but can be fun nonetheless. Thematically there are some unique some borrowed elements from other games/mythology/books/movies but are never straight up copies. In summary a solid team based game with some good players other which are less so. It is free. a lot of  the negative reviews seem to have come mainly from players who have not played for long enough for the match making system to correctly place them,5,This could be phenomenal if they only balanced it properly.I'm not even going to bother explaining what League of Legends is; you already know. It's baby's first DotA. What the game does well is being just that. It is easy to start playing and it's not hard to actually get good at the game provided you give it some time. Every two weeks Riot dishes out a new batch of free-to-playThis could be phenomenal if they only balanced it properly.I'm not even going to bother explaining what League of Legends is; you already know. It's baby's first DotA. What the game does well is being just that. It is easy to start playing and it's not hard to actually get good at the game provided you give it some time. Every two weeks Riot dishes out a new batch of free-to-play champions. These are the champions that you will be playing with until you can afford to buy your own. Now the biggest advantage that League has over its competitors is that it's easy to get into it and that is why this system is absolutely idiotic. Some weeks the champions available will just not appeal to the newbie and then they will be forced to try out uninteresting champions until they can finally buy one of their own. The next problem that arises is that you have no idea if you're actually going to like that champion. If you're not buying the cheapest ones then you will have to play countless hours to afford something acceptable and if you then end up not liking that champion then that time will have been a complete waste.But if you are rich then that's no problem! In League you can use real-life cash to buy in-game items; ranging from champions to XP-boosters. I really don't have a problem with this however. You cannot directly use real money to get better at the game. You can't buy +50% damage or something like that so I agree with this business-model.The gameplay is essentially fun but it has a tonne of problems. First of all the game is horribly imbalanced. The difference between the best and the worst champions is vast and this leads to certain champions being played every single game. You don't really have a choice if you want to succeed at the game; the best champions are simply better. I realize that it's difficult to balance so many champions and I don't expect perfection but take a look at DotA 2 for instance. The game has some issues but you can always counter a hero that is generally better than yours. In League there is nothing you can do against a skilled Master Yi or whoever. This needs to be fixed right now.Also you will master the game quickly. The skill-roof is very low and I had nothing left to learn once I hit level 15 or so. Mistakes are not punished properly as you can always use Flash and teleport to safety. There is no penalty for going back to the Well since you can just teleport there.I could go on and on but I won't.The game could potentially be fun but when you're having a good game your opponents will just press the surrender button instead of trying to turn the tides of battle.If all of these issues are fixed then this is a very good game but otherwise it is average. Run of the mill. Adequate.,7,Interesting mix between RPG and RTS similar to DotA except that it is FREE. Yes you can pay to get items in the game although most of them can be got by IP or points that you win in the game (except skins as usual in free games).

Updates are almost weekly which means the developers are constantly patching the game which means they do care about the quality. Some champions IMHO are unbalanced usually most expensive ones (and then banned on tourneys which doesn't make much sense except for getting money). Some champions are really challenging to play with with very interesting powers. Other champs look like a remix of others but this sometimes can be interesting. Time to get into a game for coop is around 5-7 seconds a bit more for PvP (~20-30 secs). You will find a mixed player base but too much kiddos for my taste.,10,I guarantee this game is voted 10 or 1 depending on who plays what game. It's a fantastic game available for free. Sure it has it's downfalls but in my opinion it is a very well made game with a great community behind the scenes. The ties with professional gaming make it even more enthralling.,9,Short and simple. Best free game that anyone could ask for. It's a MOBA style game with I believe over 100 different characters to play around with and once again... it's free to download... and free to play I recommend at least trying it out if nothing else.

I feel that its the best Dota clone out there better than Dota2 tbh as it just feels more fun to me.

If you like Dota style games and you've not tried LOL jump in and have a go its easy to pick up and oh so much fun.,8,League of Legends valiantly competes with the infamous DotA Warcraft III mod.   I'll start by saying I have never played DotA but I have played plenty of LoL.  Suffice to say the game is a fun and addicting MOBA.  However it lacks in balance and fairness.  Until level 30 you can only play blind pick matches so it is a crap-shoot as to who will win the game because some characters justLeague of Legends valiantly competes with the infamous DotA Warcraft III mod.   I'll start by saying I have never played DotA but I have played plenty of LoL.  Suffice to say the game is a fun and addicting MOBA.  However it lacks in balance and fairness.  Until level 30 you can only play blind pick matches so it is a crap-shoot as to who will win the game because some characters just win against other characters.  On the off chance that the characters chosen for a match balance each other out you might have an exciting game (score is neck and neck lots of close calls and just an interesting display of players' skills and focus will determine the outcome of the game).  However that match-up is rare in a blind pick and usually your team will roll or be rolled on (win in a landslide or lose by a landslide).  I give this game and 8 here are my reasons because it contains solid gameplay with draft pick mode (you see the opponents characters and can choose counter characters)  and because the devs add a champion almost every two weeks to a game that can be played for free.  Some games claim to be "free to play" but their item mall is atrocious and gives an unfair advantage. LoL is not one of those games and being a millionaire will not give you advantage in this game (money will only buy pretty skins for your characters which are also released regularly).  The only reasons to deduct points would be the community... don't get me started but the players you meet will test your patience. However that is easily avoided by meeting the good eggs and forming a team.,9,This game is purely amazing I have logged around 400 games and think its an incredible MOBA that teaches you how to play other MOBA's the right way.

An offline version of this game with AI controlled party members and a potential 'story' to follow would be a lovely way to kill 20-30 minutes when bored.,8,A great combination of Strategy and RPG. It's trully the best MOBA game out there. With a huge variery of champions to choose and very simply gameplay League of Legends can make you a huge addict if you keep playing! It's free-to-play but this doesn't mean that you have to "pay-to-win".

With a huge variery of champions to choose and very simply gameplay League of Legends can make you a huge addict if you keep playing! It's free-to-play but this doesn't mean that you have to "pay-to-win". On the contrary every champion is available with IP (in-game currency) which you collect just by playing or RP (Riot Points) which is the real-money currency. You can choose to play as Tank Fighter Assassin or Mage (using the "Ability Power" which makes your abilities stronger). Each champion has 4 abilities one of them being Ultimate which unlocks at Level 6. Level cap during the game is 18. Games are played 5vs5 3vs3 or even 1vs1. The most addictive thing is that as long as you play you win xp (even when losing) and you can level up your profile. After each level up you win an extra mastery point and an extra rune slot. Masteries are permament skills for your profile when you start a game and they are unlocked though a Mastery tree. Runes on the other hand are boosters which you can buy. Higher and more efficient runes are unlocked at levels 10 20 and 30. Finally when you reach level 30 you can play in ranked matches. You start at the bronze division and try to climb up to the silver gold and even platinum. Official championships give clans huge amounts of money and indie developer Riot Games has built a huge blockbuster there out of nowhere! Graphics are simple and games run with 0 frame rate drops. User interface is very easily to learn and finally voice acting fits nicely to each champion. To summarise League of Legends is one of the best experiences I ever had with the only negatives being the community that might dissapoint some of you (high percentage of youths strong language AFKers etc.) and finally maps which are very few like in the most MOBA games out there.,8,Positives: Gameplay In-Game navigation which is simple to use and easy to understand for newbies the game is free to play and download at no point do you HAVE to purchase anything but the fact is because there's no pressure to purchase and it's such a good game 99% of players will inevitably purchase things (such as new champions skins for your champions runes etc) because it's aPositives: Gameplay In-Game navigation which is simple to use and easy to understand for newbies the game is free to play and download at no point do you HAVE to purchase anything but the fact is because there's no pressure to purchase and it's such a good game 99% of players will inevitably purchase things (such as new champions skins for your champions runes etc) because it's a great game and definitely worth supporting with a few purchases. The game offers PvP and PvE both with 3v3 and 5v5 Once you reach LvL 30 you can begin participating in Ranked matches and for most of us we want to get our names up there on the Ladder Rankings for the whole world to see don't we? They're constantly adding new champions keeping the game fresh and fun to play. There're tons of in-game items to chop and change how you play your chosen champion there're so many variations with each and every match played. RIOT constantly fix bugs with frequent patch updates (every 2 weeks at the most) to ensure we're all happy as gamers. Negatives: The LoL gaming community is one of the worst I've ever experienced trolls and idiots all over the place which sadly when playing alone takes the fun away from the game a lot of the time and rage will begin to set in. This game's community has the potential to manipulate a great and friendly player into a complete nightmare with rage. That is the one and only main issue with this game. However if you can get a group together and make sure you know all members of your team and get together on Skype/Team Speak then this issue will be avoided and there won't be much to complain about. The other negative is that the servers are often buggy and RIOT have to fix things on a weekly basis although having said that it doesn't happen as often as it used to. Another minor negative is that there isn't much map variation; two 5v5 maps (one ranked map and one 'capture-the-flag' type game mode) one 3v3 map and an 'all random all mid' map which is also 5v5 but with no ranked option. If they could provide the game with another map for each game mode the fun factor of this game would definitely further increase. 8/10 as it's a great game for a free-to-play nice graphics plenty of variation no force to purchase anything at any time and even a 9 or 10/10 if you get a group of friends together. Unfortunately the poor community prevent this game from being a higher score.,8,At the moment League of Legends is probably the best MOBA available. There are a variety of balanced champions which suits to everyone's taste and play style. Gameplay is excellent. The champions are so diverse it's great to learn one and get good at it.

The leveling and item system isn't too bad but it could have been a bit more interesting. There ARE balancing issues that the developers love to ignore with a lot of overpowered items or champions but what can you do? The issue exists in every game. I enjoy the free to play model of the game as you cannot pay to win. The purchasable currency is only used for unlocking champions early or cosmetics. Speaking of cosmetics I really enjoy the artwork and graphics of the game. The splashes and fan art that come from this game are excellent. I also am one who enjoys the story of the League and lore of the various champions. It appeals to my love for fantasy games. The worst part about the game is that the community is probably the worst out of any game. It seems every other game you always get that dick or that guy who thinks he's the  It's best to typically avoid the chat and mute players as fast as you can. Despite that there isn't really a whole lot bad about the game and for a free to play it's definitely great. Just play for fun and avoid the community.,7,Will blow you away with its awesome game-playbut as well cartoonish graphics.An awesome MOBA gamebut yet the graphics seem to be a bit dated for its release datebut that doesn't matter at alldoes it?In additionthe community of the game will rage at you most of the time in the game-playbut this is the game someone could easily get in love with.,8,Quite addicting moba game  5/10 when playing alone  8 /10 with friends   Game is overall quite well balanced   patches are coming out quite good pace   Free to play with no pay to win things,10,League of Legends is certainly one of the best games i have ever played. I love everything about the game and its so fun to play the game. Certainly play this game i recommend it to everyone!!!,10,Its a good free to play MOBA game. A lot of moba out there is free  but this one is unique on its own way. It has a cartoonie graphic that makes it unique and fun to play. They update the game pretty frequently too. A very fun game to play. Its worth tryng,9,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        A really good game its better than Dota2 but need new graphics. Its funny to play alone or in group of friends I recommend a lot. I have been playing for 2 years and I did´nt be boring any time,10,I absolutely love this game and have put in enormous sums of money to buy skins and champions. I have played well into many thousands of hours (and matches) and it never ceases to bore. My favorite champion is Teemo who I have played over 630 games in Ranked Season 3. It took a long time to slog my way out of Silver 1 but now that I am in Platinum I am soooooo happy. The new LeagueI absolutely love this game and have put in enormous sums of money to buy skins and champions. I have played well into many thousands of hours (and matches) and it never ceases to bore. My favorite champion is Teemo who I have played over 630 games in Ranked Season 3. It took a long time to slog my way out of Silver 1 but now that I am in Platinum I am soooooo happy. The new League System works and it is wonderful. Many of the complaints of "poor community" and "imbalanced game-play" are a constant work in progress admittedly but for the most part after Silver community really improves dramatically. Maybe 1/20 games will there be an afker/flamer/leaver/troll etc (in Plat). The game is more balanced when facing other skilled opponents. In Platinum it is very clear that your teammates and opponents are on very similar skill-levels and every single match is a battle of sheer force of will and logic. New champions are not generally imbalanced lately and every single champion in the game has a counter or method of defeating them. Above-all this game DOES reward advanced game-playing techniques and strategies in the higher Leagues. Most games do not stall past 40 minutes unless both teams are simply so good that it is rather difficult to break through the opposing force. But those are the best games since when you finally achieve victory (or suffer defeat) you are still happy to have been a part of the glory. For an absolutely free and fairly balanced game (you cannot get ANY advantage through payments) LoL merits a 10. I've experienced 1000s of hours of unadulterated joy from this game and LoL is a part of my life as much as reading eating exercising etc. is. It is a fun hobby.,9,This free game its very very fun if you play with another 4 friends the problems are many factors about the server the trolls afk racist players etc. And the worst its the tribunal who cant punish better to these people,6,Only reason this game gets a 6 is because it is free. Really if it was for sale it should get a 4. Reason being is that is incredibly unbalanced and contrary to popular belief is not skill based at all.  Which is why the same champions are used over and over in ranked games simply because 90% of champions aren't viable. That's a serious problem.

This is coming from someone with over 865 hours of documented game play with this game. It will disappoint you. If you're looking for a good pvp game get Starcraft II at least it has a decent server.,9,Pros: -Fantastic gameplay-Great team game-Very competitive-Always something new to learn-Graphics have been updated a LOTCons:-VERY competitive-Takes a while to really get the hang of-Can be difficult if you play alone-Rune system is a bit broken-Imbalances are introduced and removed with every patch-Bronze tier players get mad a lotAlright the biggestPros: -Fantastic gameplay-Great team game-Very competitive-Always something new to learn-Graphics have been updated a LOT Cons: -VERY competitive-Takes a while to really get the hang of-Can be difficult if you play alone-Rune system is a bit broken-Imbalances are introduced and removed with every patch-Bronze tier players get mad a lot Alright the biggest complaint about this game is that the community is "abnormally toxic". My response: Welcome to the internet! Check out any major forum this isn't exclusive to LoL. Having said this I can promise you that there are less trolls in the higher tiers (Gold and beyond) To everyone saying that Riot Games is a bad company... PLEASE actually check out the LoL forums some time. Content designers art directors player support they're all on there working WITH the community to try to fix all the problems they can.,10,I have played this game ever since it launched and there were only a dozen or so champions.  Its been 3 years now and I am still playing this game?  Why do you ask because its super great fun and I can't stop playing it.

I came over to play League of Legends from Dota Allstars from WC3 (8yrs) and this game was a refreshing experience.  I've also had experience playing Smite/HoN/Dota2 and these games are not bad but I believe this game is the best for the following reasons.  1.  Company listens to the players when it comes to balancing or wanting a feature implemented.  2.  The game is completely free to play and you unlock champs with a point system you earn through playing games and there is a 10 free champ weekly rotating system so you eventually get to try everyone out before you need to unlock them.  3.  The community is significantly better then the HoN community as far as I am concerned.  4.  Game is updated frequently always with new features such as skins so the game never remains the same.  This includes holiday/seasonal things.  5.  The game is just pure fun easy to pick up and hard to master.,7,Unfortynately for me after i spend some time playin this game i finally why ppl love it and why i started to play this game less and less:- graphics of this game is somewhere in 2009- the mechanics is so pure i joined the league when Brand was a new hero and from that time i'vs started bein sad after every new hero. try to count the number of champions that have those skills: 1) urUnfortynately for me after i spend some time playin this game i finally why ppl love it and why i started to play this game less and less:- graphics of this game is somewhere in 2009- the mechanics is so pure i joined the league when Brand was a new hero and from that time i'vs started bein sad after every new hero. try to count the number of champions that have those skills: 1) ur NEXT attack will deal blablabla damage 2) after u click QWER ur champion will deal X attack with addiotional dmg;  3) deals  of hp maxmissing HP of the enemy; 4) sends smth into ur enemy (skill shot) look at Ezreal he is only this point hero all 4 abilities are the same.

First of all it is probably the least "pay to win" game I have played online. I have been playing for about a year and a half and I have about 75% of the champions and I have never spent real money on a champion nor have any of my friends.Most of the reviews for LoL seem to cite "pay to win" aspects and talk about how bad they think the graphics are and how unbalanced the gameplay is. First of all it is probably the least "pay to win" game I have played online. I have been playing for about a year and a half and I have about 75% of the champions and I have never spent real money on a champion nor have any of my friends. The only times I have spent Riot Points or RP (bought with real money) were on champion skins which have no effect on a player's skills or performance they just look cool. The graphics are relatively outdated but it serves the purpose of ensuring full frame rate during team fights when every player is auto-attacking and casting at the same time. And to be perfectly honest they're still pretty good. On the matter of unbalanced gameplay it is expected from a game that has new champions every month and updates every two weeks. The reason it's updated so often is so that Riot (the developer) can address the issues that come up after releases. Toxic player communities. Every game has them and I mean EVERY online game I have played has a certain amount of toxic players. And in recent times I have encountered far fewer while playing LoL. The truth about most of these reviewers is that they're the type of people who lose their first game and flame onto Metacritic because they think a champion is overpowered and everyone is a 12 year old. The truth is that a lot of these people who play supposedly overpowered champions are in fact high level players who make alt accounts to mess with "noobs". For the TL;DR'sPros:-Easy to learn difficult to master-Relatively fast and well balanced matchmaking-Constant updates and new champions-Plenty of diverse champions to play-No "pay to win" at all-Constantly changing metagame-Best free game I've ever played Cons:-Occasional toxic players-Outdated but solid graphics-Can get frustrating at times And to people like zeruthal why would you play for 3 years if you thought it was the worst game ever? LoL has a huge community that is constantly growing and it has it for a good reason. Alone or with a group of friends League of Legends is a great game that has diverse item and champion choices and is fun for people of any skill level.,10,I really can recommend this game. I honestly think that this one of the best F2P games out there at the moment. An important part is statement is that is it NOT one of these pay to win F2P's. You can get everything needed with money that you can earn just through playing. All you gain from buying stuff in this game with real money is a faster game progress which bears no advantage here.I really can recommend this game.

Their business model is probably one of the worst when it comes to F2P. It's simply a Pay to Win game. I can't put it any other way possible. Sure they have 10 free champions a week but that's near nothing to what they have. All of the pros seemingly have spent a lot of money into this game but they got there not only because of their skill but because of the money they spent. When it first came out I'm sure it was great. I honestly wasn't there at the time. However to these standards of today it simply doesn't reach standards. Sure there are those people who absolutely love this game but this game isn't simply for me. This game is too casual unless of course you go to ranked (that's where they teach you how to be douches) for my liking. Everyone has their likes and dislikes this is simply one of my dislikes. If you want a high quality game I suggest looking at DotA 2 however it does have it's downsides in Low Priority.,10,This game is really good. Sure it has a steep learning curve but even if you have little or no experience it's worth a try! This game is completely free-to-play with cosmetic "skins" for champions.,1,I don't like this game very much! First of all I was cheated by the trailer I thought it would be fun but it wasn't! The players were very rude and I received about 10"fuc you" in one match! Also I thought the heros sucks! They looked cool when you search for them but in the match they looked sucks!

It is fine if the items need to be bought but not the heros!I never hate a game so much but League of Legends did it successfully! Good jobLeague of Legends and riot games!,6,fun game if you can stand the god awful fan base and the whiny kids that think every champion they cant kill on there first try is "over powered" dont play this game if you arent ready to play with some of the rudest wannabes youve ever met.,10,Oh those kids with 0 and 2 points. Are u from dota2?Anyway its the greatest game in its genre with decent f2p policy and developing fast that makes it far away from all the competitors in its genre.,10,I've been a Summoner on League of Legends since the game had been Released. I've played DOTA II as well as HoN and a few other MOBA games. I've noticed that gamers who play DOTA or HoN usually don't have good things to say about other MOBA games. They says it's too easy or not balanced properly. Honestly I think it's the other way around. League is balanced more than those two games andI've been a Summoner on League of Legends since the game had been Released. I've played DOTA II as well as HoN and a few other MOBA games. I've noticed that gamers who play DOTA or HoN usually don't have good things to say about other MOBA games. They says it's too easy or not balanced properly. Honestly I think it's the other way around. League is balanced more than those two games and the only way it could be considered easier is that you can actually see what's going on. DOTA and HoN use graphics that make it more difficult to see the game-play and that makes it more difficult to play. Graphics are one thing but they also have a terrible item/store layout that makes it hard to get a proper build going. League of Legends has nice graphics for a MOBA game and the Item/Store Layout makes it easy to find certain items or lists of Items by category. The most important thing about a Team Based Game from my perspective would be the community of players. League had a lot of players who would just ruin your experience while playing the game when it first came out. Since then they have implemented the Tribunal and the Honor System. The Tribunal is basically a place where players review cases of reported players and help decide whether they should be punished/warned or not. The ultimate outcome of the cases are reviewed by the RIOT Team to ensure a fair trial. The Tribunal has helped clean up the community and eventually another system was needed to ensure the results lasted. Eventually they Implemented the Honor System. This system encouraged players to have better behavior such as Sportsmanship and Teamwork. You earn points after a game when someone acknowledges you for the category you've earned. So far there are only ribbons distributed for earning a certain amount of points and there are rumors of icons you can earn as well. The result of these two systems has made the game experience so much better than any other MOBA game I've played. DOTA II and HoN have such a negative community that even if you like the game you would stop playing just because of the community. Bottom Line... League of Legends is the best MOBA game out there. Great game-play and Community experience. It's far more Enjoyable than all of the Other Team Based Strategy Games.,9,Mkay not sure why there is so much hate on this game.  I have a dependable ISP in a major US city and and i5 laptop and rarely experience connectivity issues. That aside the game itself is really fun!  It reminds me of the PVP competitions on Diablo II back in the day.  This game is really just a cleaver revision of PVP combined with the dota mods from WC3.  The cooperative aspectMkay not sure why there is so much hate on this game.

It reminds me of the PVP competitions on Diablo II back in the day.  This game is really just a cleaver revision of PVP combined with the dota mods from WC3.  The cooperative aspect reminds me of online play in D2 as well but it also reminds me of a modded mode in Starcraft where friends and myself would play 4v4 and give each player a unique 'avatar' unit with huge states and self- healing abilities.  Sound familiar? And for those who claim that DOTA is better b/c it's original; in 2002 I played a modded game on Starcraft: Broodwars called BunkerWars.  The concept of the game was that you had continuously respawing soldiers in or around a terran bunker and your enemy had the same.  The goal was to destroy the enemy's bunker before yours was destroyed.  So don't get too upset about DOTA being copied.  The MOBA game concept was around long before WC3 even existed. As for the toxic player community.  That just comes with the territory.  Being anonymous means not giving a ****  Play some Club Penguin if you want a nice social atmosphere.,7,the character roster is large and fairly balanced unlike a few years ago this was my first MOBA and i still play it has a big E-sport following and is great fun to play....with friends the community is fairly toxic unfortunately and i play on the EU W servers which break at least once a week,10,Better then Dota 2 atleast they got halloween event 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111223123123123123,10,Better than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter thanBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween contentBetter than dota 2 got halloween content,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        League of Legends is an amazing game that combines the loved creation of Defense of the Ancients with their own personal flavor and strategies. Removing certain aspects of DotA while keeping a stronger teamwork focus has created an engaging colorful world.,5,MY SCORE 49 The game is good a good revolution of MOBA's This is a good game and I played it recently and at its release even if I didn't have much interest in the game.

I prefer DotA but even that can be insult to LoL players but we have to consider this 5 was a 6 if the review was made years ago but the games get decayed games can be compared to life not all games can be the most popular game ever and players should get used to it. This game has great mechanics not focusing not that much being a esport but their hurry in making new content ends up in having some inbalances and nerfs. LoL can't be a "full esport" because some mechanics are fully recostumized I mean new items that influence game. This is a very good game to play casually and if you want esport and more dificult and dedication you will probably end up in DotA.,10,hands down the best game i have ever played in terms of fun and endurance too.

The community itself can be sub-par at times but the MOBA experience is still well-designed and Riot is responsive to the community's demands.,6,Nothing special.........................................................................................................................................................................................,7,Fun to play but to many champions to choose from and it's hard to figure out which is your best also has server lag spikes which get annoying after a while.

It's graphics may be however rather outdated in the perspective of a veteran gamer. As many other critics believe that balance can be perfect in such a game they obviously live in their own self-hollowed illusions. The game is balanced for those who know how to play it inexperienced players will obviously find heroes that have beaten them/they don't know to be unbalancing. I can assure that out of the top MOBA strategy games that I have played League of Legends is currently the most balanced as they care more about balance rather than the minority pitiful inexperienced players' demands.,6,I have been playing this game for 2 years now 6+h a day probably all-thou game it self deserve 9/10 all parts of the game has to be included witch goes to a problem with Riot-player and player-player interaction.. they are negative about 2/10 so if u don't have a bunch of tolerance towards idiotisam don't go near it... i don't have any but i still play it till i get baned... full ofI have been playing this game for 2 years now 6+h a day probably all-thou game it self deserve 9/10 all parts of the game has to be included witch goes to a problem with Riot-player and player-player interaction.. they are negative about 2/10 so if u don't have a bunch of tolerance towards idiotisam don't go near it... i don't have any but i still play it till i get baned... full of flaming kids who will which u cancerdeathrape and call u all different names it lacks any for of communication except for pining and chat with is annoying when Team Fights (tf) last for 5 sec and many of needed team plays relies on team... which is nonexistent so yeah 6/10,6,Al principio el juego puede engancharte y viciarse unas partidas con tus amigos pero vamos a analizar el juego mas profundamente. >La jugabilidad es muy simple mala y a veces engorrosa.  >Los gráficos son aceptables para este tipo de juegos pero deja mucho que desear aun así. >El sonido es lo mejor del juego totalmente en español y con buena música. >La Innovación es mínima siempreAl principio el juego puede engancharte y viciarse unas partidas con tus amigos pero vamos a analizar el juego mas profundamente. >La jugabilidad es muy simple mala y a veces engorrosa.  >Los gráficos son aceptables para este tipo de juegos pero deja mucho que desear aun así. >El sonido es lo mejor del juego totalmente en español y con buena música. >La Innovación es mínima siempre trata de lo mismo matar defender y destruir torretas a lo largo de varias partidas se vuelve algo monótono y absurdo llegando a aburrir a extremo de manera abismal. En conclusión: Lo recomiendo para amantes de juegos de Rol jugandolo con amigos para el resto es mejor fijarse en otro tipo de juegos que sean mas divertidos y entretenidos.,10,I've been playing this game for almost 3 years and it is just getting better each time. New champions every month and repairing bugs and changing things to make the game more balanced. Huge community very accessible game and the tec need for this game are few so you can play it anywhere. Excellent game.,10,Minecraft is one of the most revolutionary games out there. The open worlds are AMAZING. There is so much to do now with 1.7 just came out. It is so worth the cash. Go get it now.,10,What hasn't been said about League of Legends? Nothing....that's what. So why are you reading this??? Go and play this game it's fun free and addicting what more would you want from a game (except maybe a community that's the worst in all of gaming).,5,There are many Pro and Cons the main ones:Game is fun with friends playing causally. If you play solo prepare to get disappointed/frustrated as there are many trolls/team griefers. Ranked is very competitive and often the playerbase is very toxic and abusive to bad performances. The graphic just got updated so it's pretty nice. Lots of new updates/Champions to keep the game fresh.,10,There is a reason this is the most played game on the planet. League of Legends provides a gameplay experience unlike any other game available. If you are looking for something new and don't want to spend money this game is perfect. League delivers where DOTA 2 fails where DOTA is unbalanced and (in my opinion) ugly League is balanced with its own unique art style. All you need toThere is a reason this is the most played game on the planet. League of Legends provides a gameplay experience unlike any other game available. If you are looking for something new and don't want to spend money this game is perfect. League delivers where DOTA 2 fails where DOTA is unbalanced and (in my opinion) ugly League is balanced with its own unique art style. All you need to join the fun is a decent computer and a semi-stable internet connection. In its defense there is no pay to win features in League of Legends. All items that affect gameplay can be bought through IP the experience currency. Runes that strengthen champions can only be bought with IP while RP is only used for skins and champions. This game is definitely worth trying.,4,This game kept me wondering for a while if I liked it or not. My first impression was good in my opinion it has a big potential the F2P model applied here is simply one of the best I've seen in a game. The game itself is fun even in it's repetitiveness. There's so much content in here to keep you around for days.I played it for quite a long time but finally I ended up hating it. NowThis game kept me wondering for a while if I liked it or not. My first impression was good in my opinion it has a big potential the F2P model applied here is simply one of the best I've seen in a game. The game itself is fun even in it's repetitiveness. There's so much content in here to keep you around for days.I played it for quite a long time but finally I ended up hating it. Now it makes me sad to say that I really hate this game. I do not think it is the game itself that is not good I do not believe it. It's the community and the way it is managed that is horrendous. Players are just bad people. When I quit playing I decided this game just takes out the worst of everyone who plays it. And that is sad 'cause the game was sometimes funny. The game itself nontheless has some really big defects that I just cannot explain to me:- why keep playing in just two or three maps? Why can't we have some more choice about the battlefield? We have so many heroes to choose between why do we have just a single map to play a certain game mode? Do not tell me this is the MOBA style because it seems to me it's just an excuse to develop less game content...- why developing the ingame chat? What's the use of it apart from insulting team mates and distracting from game action?- what's the meaning of the really overabused surrender option? Why is there? I just cannot understand these aspects of the game and I think they just make the game bad. My final response: if you're a kid that cannot stand a defeat in a win/lose game and you enjoy insulting everyone who plays with you this game is just for you. Enjoy.,9,This game despite what the people who have played for 5 minutes and have dismissed as terrible is a well balanced and fun game people seem to be stuck on the fact that there are powerful champions that always get picked but every champion has its weaknesses and its strong points and you can easily win against someone who counters you with a little bit of skill. It seems like people areThis game despite what the people who have played for 5 minutes and have dismissed as terrible is a well balanced and fun game people seem to be stuck on the fact that there are powerful champions that always get picked but every champion has its weaknesses and its strong points and you can easily win against someone who counters you with a little bit of skill. It seems like people are put off by the first game because  of someone who can 1 hit you I can assure you there is not a single person in league that can just outright beat anyone from level one. My advice is to play through the first couple bad games you have until you start understanding how its played and then give your judgement on it unlike the rest of the people who give this game zeros. Also everyone seems to be comparing this to DOTA2 and HoN but these games focus on different aspects of the genre.,6,First off this is actually a very good game good mechanics and diverse gameplay from over 100 unique champions. There are champions to suit every skill level. Graphics sound in game shop and the completely viable option of playing this game without spending a single cent makes this game great. However what brings this down is the ever present lag and awful community of trollsFirst off this is actually a very good game good mechanics and diverse gameplay from over 100 unique champions. There are champions to suit every skill level. Graphics sound in game shop and the completely viable option of playing this game without spending a single cent makes this game great. However what brings this down is the ever present lag and awful community of trolls noobs who act pro and those annoying people who try desperately to steal your kill and call ks when they fail miserably and then report you. In the end you get warned for not letting people step all over you. It is the community that really drives people away. What with leavers outright A-holes and just trolls all over it is no wonder all my friends left the game.,10,I love this game I made ​​my above lives I touch it with pennies.

Great community of youtube streamers and helpful forums. able to be run on most any computer. Fun multiplayer or  solo que modes.,10,I've read some of the reviews others have written and I'd like to address some of them in my own.

First of all someone criticized the fact that although there are a variety of champions there are only two maps. While this is true I do not see this as a fault but rather a feature. Focusing on two quality maps with precise attention to detail (e.g. using the flash works at precise thickness of objects champion abilities what have you) allows you to focus more on gameplay and strategy. Secondly someone wrote that they wish there was a way to mute people who rage. Well there is a way. You simply click on their name and press mute. Furthermore there is a tribunal system in place which allows users to report negative players be it that they are toxic or feeding or afk. Members of the community then review the case and chat and place judgement on the case. Someone else wrote that it was imbalanced. I would argue quite the contrary and say that it's probably one of the MOST balanced games out there. You can review statistics of wins based on each champion and as you'll notice the community does a great job at reporting champions that are too buff or fixing glitches what have you. Furthermore in ranked games there are 3 bans per team so if your team leader thinks that a particular champion (or 3) are overpowered they can be banned. Finally I would like to close by saying this...League of Legends is a community based multiplayer online battle arena game which is free to play no strings attached. I love this game and though it does have some minor issues once in awhile if you take the time to learn about it odds are you will appreciate it for the work of art it really is. PS for everyone who is mad that it's a rip off of DoTA all I have to say is the developers took an awesome product and made it even better. Get over it.,6,This is really solid MOBA game. In perfect scenario it is really enjoyable and fun to play but..- archaic client's architecture comes with new glitches and bugs with every patch- some balance changes are absolutely pointless no identifying real core of the issue- law of jungle and bad community - and yes flamers are not the worse part of it at least some portion of it getsThis is really solid MOBA game. In perfect scenario it is really enjoyable and fun to play but..- archaic client's architecture comes with new glitches and bugs with every patch- some balance changes are absolutely pointless no identifying real core of the issue- law of jungle and bad community - and yes flamers are not the worse part of it at least some portion of it gets punished in some way in worst scenario you can mute them. But there are also feeders afkers trolls who ruin your game experience on purpose and you can't do anything about it. You can report them but there is obviously no punishment for it and Riot absolutely doesn't care about it. To be honest it's one of the worst customer care in gaming history. All they focus is e-sport side of this game and don't care about providing a friendly environment in any way in regular games. So summing up a lot of games feels like a waste of time. If you loose because of being outplayed - it's natural but if you loose and waste 30+minutes just because someone feeds or trolls on purpose - it's just demotivating. So in perfect scenario (no flame no feed no trolling) this game is 9/10 but since perfect scenarios tend to happen extremely rarely 6/10 is max I can give it's just more often frustrating than fun.,10,Very enjoyable game. I spend hours playing this game every week. Excellent gameplay. The free-to-play model work fine as no real money is needed to fully play this game. The ranked game allow to keep a goal even after hitting level 30. Riot put a lot of effort improving the community interaction with the tribunal.,9,I've read many other terrible reviews all scoring 10 or 0.

It's not that this game is unfair its played at tournaments its just that its hard to get good. this game can be quite hard if you aren't fully equipped with a good PC often leading to the many misleading user reviews. this game is amazing and if you're always looking for something new try playing a different champion. the gameplay is very addictive and fun when played right and can also be frustrating learning to play well can be quite a challenge but is worth it once you mastered your personal way of playing. Keep in mind that riot's only form of income is its riot points that are only useful for buying skins everything else is a waste because its free to play which means you can play it now! So go play and judge for yourself whether you enjoy it or not.,6,The game itself isn't bad at all it's actually very fun. However the community that ruins it completely. Seriously. It makes the game unplayable!!!!,5,Played HoN. Play DoTA2. Played League. League may have filled a niche at one point but that niche is withering.Until they update their engine drop pay to win and break the mold on their hero/play concept this game deserves to be left behind as a one time Star that has age very poorly.Really I think a LoL2 needs to happen to save this franchise over the long term.AndPlayed HoN.

People complain about balancing problems but riot is constantly fixing and updating them they do listen to the community. If you've seen any tournaments you would realize this is a very competitive and enjoyable game.,1,This game is so frustrating. Yes its addicting but the community is either troll or toxic.

You can't have a competitive game if the creator cycles the "free" part every week leaving players who don't want to donate hundrets of dollars unable to compete in fair conditions. Each player is literally forced to pay each month just to keep what he or she had last week. Another very simple trick: release a new champion just like one of the old ones but with much better stats. It doesn't have the deepness of dota there are no "special" mechanics player doesn't make as many meaningful decisions as he or she does in dota. This is probably a good thing there're not so many gamechanging things happening overall. You can't fail hard you can't win big - some people will like this but I don't. Visual aspect is probably individual but if you're not an anime/cartoon lover you'll probably like dota2's graphics more. Just google up some screenshots and compare. Movies are insanely good - they probably costed more than the whole game itself quality level is totally not the same. I love the genre - don't get me wrong any game in that genre already has to get a solid mark from me. But the issue with that one in particular is about the people running it. You'll never find anyone that greedy in gamedev at all. Not even Bliz who asks like 100$ for each expansion. Not even EA or any other "pay 2 win" / "same old **** for 50$". People in the lead of riot did certain actions to destroy a few of the existing communities - some people are simply dangerous if they get the money - so please do NOT pay. Not to mention how well they "synthesize" numbers - pretty sure that is one of the main focus for them - to generate a ****load of "virtual" players/viewers.,2,I've played LOL almost 1 year. Beside the game experience this is an online game which you play it other people and you can be sure you will meet the most annoying people in your life in this game. Just terrible community.

I know friends that have thrown 100's of dollars to get the best champs. That's fine if you are buying it because he looks cool but no you are forced to buy the best champs if you even want to try to have fun in this game.

But luckily the genre is getting a boost and hopefully we can leave this lie behind us.,4,League of Legends is an okay game but it really doesn't excel at anything at all except for it's marketing. I have played the game for about 3 years now (climbed my way to the rank of Gold 2) and I finally uninstalled it a few months ago with no intentions of returning. It is an excellent time sink if you have literally no other game to play. I've played for hundreds of hours soloLeague of Legends is an okay game but it really doesn't excel at anything at all except for it's marketing. I have played the game for about 3 years now (climbed my way to the rank of Gold 2) and I finally uninstalled it a few months ago with no intentions of returning. It is an excellent time sink if you have literally no other game to play. I've played for hundreds of hours solo and with friends and wasted plenty of money on useless cosmetic skins (protip: do not do this ever it is a slippery slope.) I have a few friends who justify spending upwards of 20 dollars just to change the clothes their champions are wearing. Many of these microtransactions are completely ridiculous and overpriced yet Riot seems to get away with it since their playerbase doesn't seem to care in the slightest. Furthermore in recent additions to the game not only did they increase the base IP(points that you gain through playing the game that can be spent on unlocking champions) that new champions cost they made the past five or six champions incredibly overpowered. I speculate that this chain of events took place in order to drive up their sales by forcing people to either use almost 10 hours worth of IP to unlock the champion or shell out about 10 bucks to unlock the champion. Whether or not this was their intention this practice seems exploitative of the consumers as by the time these champions drop in price they have been through several nerfs and revisions that make them far less powerful. Overall as a consumer I can not recommend this game to anyone. It's guise of free-to-play comes with caveats the community as a whole is incredibly rude and unwelcoming and the gameplay is a bit shallow with it's strict repetitive metagame that Riot encourages players to follow to a T. Credit where it is due though I have not really experienced too many game breaking glitches and matchmaking is OK at best. However due to the lack of perceivable fun in the game I have decided to score it thusly.,6,Overall this is a nice game. It is not perfect or original but it's fun. I perfectly understand all the negative reviews the community is a HUGE problem and ruins most of your matches. Personally I can't stand the solo queue (AKA ranked matches playing with other people that you don't know) sometimes I find nice people to play with they teach me and tell me what I'm doing wrong andOverall this is a nice game. It is not perfect or original but it's fun. I perfectly understand all the negative reviews the community is a HUGE problem and ruins most of your matches. Personally I can't stand the solo queue (AKA ranked matches playing with other people that you don't know) sometimes I find nice people to play with they teach me and tell me what I'm doing wrong and what should I do because they want to help me and want help to win. Other times I find people that doesn't care at all of what are you doing if they are playing bad then they are going to flame you because you didn't do this or that so it is your fault that they are dying. For the game itself It is still 6. The character rooster is great and each champion is truly unique so each time you play it can be different. Most of them are balanced and if they aren't the game is patched pretty quickly introducing nerfs and buffs but then there are some champions that are so powerful that you can see them in the enemy team in every match (ex. in these months I've seen Yasuo in nearly ANY match I've played and in draft picks he's always banned) and this can unbalance the game but if you have a good team you can still win. This game is totally not Pay 2 Win in fact you can only pay with real money for skins and boosts the rest can be purchased with in-game currency. If you are looking for a game to play with your friends or you like competition then download it you will not be disappointed but if you are playing alone and are easly annoyed by flamers then avoid this game at all costs it's just not worth it,10,Well community in this game sux from time to time developers release stupid champions crazy overpowered crazy underpowered some times you lose 30-40 min of your life because some guy will go afk wants to troll etc. but still I play this game...

Its a great team game to play and has a ton of people constantly playing. You play as champions in 5v5 combat against each other. You get to unlock more champions by gaining in game currency and playing more. The community is known though for trolling and the servers do have its blips too. There's 100+ ChampionsLeague of Legends is really what put MOBAs on the map and brought me into it. Its a great team game to play and has a ton of people constantly playing. You play as champions in 5v5 combat against each other. You get to unlock more champions by gaining in game currency and playing more. The community is known though for trolling and the servers do have its blips too. There's 100+ Champions for a variety of gameplay and 4 different modes while I believe most of it's played on the 5v5 map Summoners Rift. It has a bit of a learning curve if you're new especially to people with no MOBA experience. It's a free game and supported by micro-transactions for skins which are pretty cool. The eSports scene in the game is huge and pretty entertaining as well. The main problems with me in League of Legends is that for a team game there's not enough communication options in my opinion as well the movement doesn't feel super smooth and at some points you can zone out trying to last hit minions. I also think the map for as long as it's been out needs some adjustments. Overall I believe it's an 8 out of 10 in fun to me it's really fun with friends but alone I don't feel like a big part of a team and communicating isn't so strong.,9,So I have been playing League of Legends for a couple months now and due to my extensive gaming past or just the fact that I have played 600+ games I have picked up the game relatively quick. I have not played DOTA 2 which is the other MOBA (Mobile Online Battle Arena) but I have played many other online games including first person shooters real time strategies and massivelySo I have been playing League of Legends for a couple months now and due to my extensive gaming past or just the fact that I have played 600+ games I have picked up the game relatively quick. I have not played DOTA 2 which is the other MOBA (Mobile Online Battle Arena) but I have played many other online games including first person shooters real time strategies and massively multiplayer online role playing games and League is by far the most addictive for me.I started playing when numerous friends of mine convinced me to and they taught me all the basics of the game. That was about all they could really help with before I had to find out the rest for myself because the game has so very much to it. At the beginning the basics seem a little overwhelming but once those are learned everything else just becomes improvements and there are always room for more which keeps the player playing. Since every game is against new players it is a different experience every time without fail as opposed to killing the same computer programed boss every game. What mixes well with this is the myriad of champions that League of Legends boasts which is up to I believe over 100 now. The champions or playable characters leave room for something new every game as each one has different abilities and purposes.Most of the fun in the game comes from learning all these champions and if you’re at all like me the gain of skill is what makes the game addicting. Since every game you can do a little better and better until you’re the one beating up the other guys and even then you can just play a new champion and do it all over again until you are great with both. The other variations in gameplay is the different positions in which different champions excel. There are 5 positions and they each do something very different leaving room for anyone to find one or more that they enjoy. Even with all the focus on individual gameplay the game comes down to a team game that is fantastic to play with friends if you can.The biggest problem of the game is part of the community that plays. There are people in every game that just play to make everyone else angry and League of Legends is no exception. There are people who will rage in the chat run around dying making the game easier for the enemies or just simply quit mid game. With each game played being composed of 10 players 1 player can completely shift the mood of the game from something friendly and fun to a waist of time. The majority of the time this doesn’t happen it’s just when it does it can cut the fun into little to nothing.League of Legends is in all a very fun game especially to those that enjoy skill based games against players. I would recommend it to anyone who has some extra time on their hands and wants a longstanding game to play with friends.,10,It's a great game  no need to pay to win. Always updates  champions and championships.Only thing is paid skins to beautify the champions .All F2P games should follow the model of the League of Legends,8,Let's start this by saying I don't care which game came first which is ripping off the other and so on.

The main reasons for not loving it would be the difficulty to differentiate my attacks from the enemy's while on team fights (note that this happens so often that I've gotten really used to it. But at first it annoyed the heck out of me) and the por variety of gameplay. Also mayority of the players seem incredibly rude even by Online Gaming standarts  The fact that one can report another player simply because of being a "noob" also annoys me. Nevertheless I find the game to be fun while playing it with friends (not so much alone. Again 'cause of the masses). Sure it can be frustrating at times but it can also be really rewarding other times.,5,The game is OK. It was clear that was developed by DoTA designers so there are no "copy" between DoTA and LoL heroes.The problems aren't on the game itself: they are on anywhere else.

So I have played this game for little over a year now and after looking at the review I'm just gonna have to point out a few things. If you have the whole idea of "Grinding" with this game then you are looking at it wrong.

You are not supposed to get all of the champions in 1 year unless you want to pay. And thats the thing if all you are doing is "Grinding" then this game isnt for you. If graphics is all that matters to you then you should go play something else because this game is NOT about graphics even though they have redone the art design recently its still not the best but this doesnt affect me if it affects you then go play the Witcher 3. Overall this game is very addictive and especially with 4 friends you can all collaborate via skype and its just really really fun. I have spent almost 500 hours with this game and still going.Also "Free to play" isnt exactly true if you know what i mean XD. (Skins m8),8,I love League of Legends and i've been playing it for a while. I dont give it a 10 because the community do not deserve it. Too much rage which is hard to ignore sometimes. Apart from that its amazing what you can do there. So many things to learn and to improve.,5,My list descending in personal priority concerning negative and positive aspects: Negative:1. The company seems very greedy there are nearly no improvements for the community as a whole2. The actual development method makes the game game feel more and more insubstantial3.

Gameplay intuitiveness esports are all excellent. It is hard to imagine how much users are playing this game. It also tells us that this game is great.,9,Very fun and addictive game but the community is SO toxic. It's a very good game.,6,LOL can be entertaining.  Biggest complaint from me is the inability to play any hero from the start.  You need to pay for heroes or play a lot of games for points to unlock them.  This will require a lot of time.  There are also full skins that are obtained by paying.  Learning curve is smaller than Dota 2 but feel that Dota 2 is more entertaining to play and to watch.,7,This is an honest review of the game. From what I have read most of the reviews on this site are mostly people who hate the game because they have not played it that long/people that are raging because they don't know how to play that well or people who have clearly not played that many other games and think it's the most amazing game in the world. (There are some decent reviews thoughThis is an honest review of the game.

(There are some decent reviews though Hint: Most of the 10/10s are the ones I was talking about being the ones that have not played many other games) This game is not bad but it has a low metacritic average *for a game this popular* for a reason: because it's not that good. No it isn;t because of graphics yes there are a few broken champions (Not that many though. I don't overuse the word few. There are hardly any but they are still there.) but this isn;t why the game is overrated. The combat in the game could be so much better but it isn't. I'm not trying to sound biased (not invoking a Dota vs League argument here just using this as an example) but play Dota 2 for a while learn how to play and compare the 2's combat system. Ever notice how League's combat system is not as satisfying? Ever notice how League of Legends is based more around how good you are with a champion than actually being good at the game? This game is also not that hard anyone who tells you that is lying. I have no difficulty in fighting 4v5s and winning or being ona  feeding team and turning it around when the enemy team has the advantage. This game is incredibly easy once you learn the basics. The main reason why this game is not so great is because it tried to be an improved Dota (which it could have) but the changes they made thinking they were improvements are what makes this an overrated game  that and the combat system is barely above average. Is this game addicting? Yes. Is it great? No.,8,Great game but after playing 3k hours of DotA LoL seems very easy and casual to me which is great because its very relaxing.

This game is a complete joke in terms of teamplay and ranked matches are way worse.

I enjoy HoTS more than this. I used to invest my time in this game more than anything else so that I can improve and achieve a more professional level but ranked ELO queue has not been fixed ever since S4. I don't care what other people comment about the positive things of ranked games. I personally don't agree with the balanced MMR that Riot has implemented. Even in normal games where players normally practice and have fun are all over the place when feeders afkers or lane throwers exist taking the whole game which is supposed to end in twenty minutes up to an hour. It's even worse when a winning game turns to a losing one because someone potentially throws! Toxic community is another thing. I'm also a foul talker sometimes but within legitimate reasons. Almost every MMO gaming community has uncountable numbers of toxic players but the ones I've encountered in LoL are laughably idiotic or arrogant. Teammates or opponents don't matter they are pretty much all the same. This is something you can easily detect in most matchmakings so go figure. Lastly which is my biggest face-palm disappointment is the company Riot itself. Riot doesn't know anything about player-base reality. The supports are useless and almost never look into reasonable appeals. They don't tolerate anything out of the grey and execute things only through their retarded code of conduct. They have poor community speculations and are late on immediate actions. They take a year to do player behavioral inspection which is absolutely **** They take away things that you have worked so hard to earn over the course of the season due to their unexplained accusation or whatever fancy violations they take so seriously about. They stripped away my rank status aside from temporary ban because they thought I MMR boosted when I shared account with my distant relative. Up until this point I'm still very pissed of their decisions. There are plenty better moba games outside of this **** I used to have a highschool friend working for Riot so I rated this game a medium score for the sake of respect but now we no longer are friends so I'm dropping the score way lower this time. My fun times on this game is over. Time to move on with my life. ps. With all due respects f*** you Riot Azure Day,3,Quite a good game unfortunately the playerbase lets it down.

Graphically it is similar to several games of its kind so it does not stand out musically it goes unnoticed and in terms of content it is quite poor (even with its immensity of characters) since it only has practically one game mode and one map (except few exceptions). In spite of everything it ends up being a product that offers what the player asks for and is fun beyond its poor overall content it gets people to stay playing which is a merit to be taken into account. 6.0/10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Los multijugadores masivos nunca han sido mi especialidad mas con LOL llevo aproximadamente unas 300+ horas de juego desde que lo descubrí un par de años atrás y creo que “le llegó la hora”. La mayor virtud de LOL es que puede dar diversión directa tanto a jugadores novatos como a personas que buscan un verdadero reto ya que aunque es simple entender su concepto de juego es increíblemente complejo dominarlo. Gráficamente es similar a varios juegos de su tipo por lo cual no destaca musicalmente pasa desapercibido y en cuanto a contenido se queda bastante pobre (aun con su inmensidad de personajes) ya que solo cuenta con prácticamente un modo de juego y un mapa (salvo contadas excepciones). A pesar de todo termina siendo un producto que ofrece lo que el jugador pide y es diversión más allá de su contenido pobre en líneas generales logra que la gente se quede jugando lo cual es un mérito a tomar en cuenta. 6.0/10,9,Being the only game i play also a  (team based) PvP and forgivable Free-to-Play approach will easily hook you on hours upon hours. With a massive selection of characters with different abilities and roles gives you many options. However it has a unforgivable player-base that every game has due to the horrible mentality our society has.

It became too esports focused not that that is a bad thing but they left behind all the other players.  They took away the funny style they had and replaced it with a much too serious tone.

They even redid the original characters because they were no longer fitting into the world they'd changed the game to be.  They started adding too many characters and not caring about the balance of the game.  Though adding the new maps and gameplay styles was a big plus and kept the game from droping a few more points in my book! I still play once in a while but I just don't have the heart for it anymore especially with new MOBAs like Vainglory.,9,nine because the game is fun and addicting with many strategies you can make and champions have different skill sets. not 10 because they need to solve the lag in the game. ty,1,If your gonna have a MOBA with over 100 characters to play atleast try to balance them out. Its pathetic how some champions are just dead due to the fact that the kits they have are "Not for the current meta". Riot should have stopped in 2013.,6,When you first start out it becomes really addicting but this game involves a lot of grinding for IP (in-game currency). Took me a about month to get a certain amount of IP to get the champion I wanted. Grinding so much really took the fun out of playing it. But it is certainly a better experience with 4-5 friends. Also too many OP Champions and a lot of balancing issues.,5,Potentially fun game at times but spoilt by a number of things. In my experience this game attracts only the worst of what the internet has to offer in terms of people. It got to the point that I'd rather be having a chat about philosophy to a Call of Duty kid instead of having to bear with the ignorance and general idiocy that comes with most of the community on this game. And thenPotentially fun game at times but spoilt by a number of things.

It got to the point that I'd rather be having a chat about philosophy to a Call of Duty kid instead of having to bear with the ignorance and general idiocy that comes with most of the community on this game. And then comes the match ups there are always top tier characters (to be fair like any game but as it's a battle arena this makes for boring games). This just makes for the same gameplay over and over again when you'd think that with over 100+ characters the word 'variety' would manage to show up. I tried to enjoy this and now I'm just left with a foul taste in my mouth personally. However to add some good points: I can enjoy this game at time when playing with a full party of friends. This however as my level increases becomes rarer and rarer. So overall? It's mediocore. Fun at times.,5,Back in 2010 i used to enjoy the game and community wouldnt be like "OMG noob you feeder" the game goes in wrong side making me quit the game people smurf with  R-A-FRiot still keeps the unbalanced champions ekko yasuo katarina...People who troll makes the game also unbearable!Riot makes riot points less worth back in the day we had: 520rp 975rp and 1820rp skins now they make weirdBack in 2010 i used to enjoy the game and community wouldnt be like "OMG noob you feeder" the game goes in wrong side making me quit the game people smurf with  R-A-FRiot still keeps the unbalanced champions ekko yasuo katarina...People who troll makes the game also unbearable!Riot makes riot points less worth back in the day we had: 520rp 975rp and 1820rp skins now they make weird prices making few riot points left such 250rp 750rp 1350rp before we did not get 1350rp they lower the rp amount for a card.

League of Legends is a Massive Online Battle Arena or MOBA for short style game.  It is one of the most popular online games in the world hosting a player base of over 27 million every day.  I have played League for almost 5 years now.  I have logged over 1200 hours onto it and that does not include the time spent off of my main account.  I have 4 accounts one of which is on the beta server.  I read all the patch notes know all the characters and all of their abilities.  For several hours of every week I take to the fields of justice to decide the fate of Runeterra.League of Legends overall is a good game.  My 8 out of 10 should not be a surprise considering the rampant popularity.  To be honest I only really have two complaints with the game.  The first is the system of Match Making Rating or MMR as it is commonly called.  My second is the community.MMR is what determines who is on your team and who you are against.  This helps to prevent low ranked people from being paired with or against very high ranked people.  To this extent it works very well.  However as people climb the ranks it can be a very punishing system.  In order to climb in ranked tiers you must win games in order to earn league points or LP.  At 100 LP you earn the chance to move up to the next tier by winning two out of three of the next games.  But the amount of LP you earn and lose upon a win or loss is determined by your current MMR and the MMR of your teammates and opponents.  Since MMR rises slower than LP unless you are on a very large win streak this causes people to earn little LP for a win but lose a large amount on a loss.  In my experience (which isn't even the worst of it) I’ve been winning 16 LP but losing 24.The community is the biggest complaint of the majority of league players.  Matt Truong lower ranked player who has logged over 1000 hours over the course of 3 years under the name solidious101 says “The toxicity and attitude of certain players creates an inhospitable atmosphere for newer players.” Although it has greatly improved over time.  When I first started playing almost 5 years ago you couldn't go even one game without a raging flamer who  would probably quit partway through the game.  But Riot Games (the producers of League of Legends) began to really crack down on them.  They managed to remove most of the ragers in my opinion.  Occasionally you’ll still find one but it is a relatively rare experience compared to five years ago.  However while there are less ragers overall those that do still exist tend to be pretty toxic.Those 2 complaints may be fairly large but as I said league is still a good game. First off it's easy to learn.  League of Legends is probably the simplest and most streamlined MOBA style.  The entire game can pretty much be summed up in 5 game mechanics: poke push team fight cs and trade.  This reason is commonly cited as to why it is so popular. People see pro players do something and think to themselves “that's not that hard I could do that (although most people cannot thus explain why they are not pro players).”  This brings a lot of people onto the game and keeps them hooked since they are always trying out new things and striving to get better.Another big reason for why league is a good game is the length of each match.  One match of league is about 35 minutes and no two matches are the same.  This yields two things that make for a good game: ease of access and replay value.  I tout The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess as my favorite game ever but I have only played that for about 55-60 hours versus the hundreds I have spent on league. For league if you have a free 50 minutes or so you should easily be able to get a game in but in legend of Zelda you need a solid hour and a half or more if you want to enjoy it.  Moreover every time you play Zelda it's the same thing. Between having over a hundred characters to choose from extremely varied item builds and more players than you could ever play with you can play league for the rest of your life and never have the same two experiences.The most important reason that League of Legends is a good game however is that it is a multi-player game. League is played with others and is in a way meant to be played with friends.  I myself hardly ever play on my own I almost always am playing with at least one friend.  Sunny Kakkad an intermediate level player who has logged 1100 hours on league over the last 3 years under the name Sunnsenpai19 says “I only ever play with friends usually [tsukiomi]. I even play ranked with other people even though that raises the MMR.” When you play with friends the game tends to be taken less seriously and it is more ok to do trolly things which is more fun.  The vast majority of the time when I play with my friends we aren't in the same room or even building.  We just use a third p,5,This game is a waste of time for 3 things the community is a total disgust as it is free to play but the reporting system is a total scam and no sense  there are also champions that do not reward your ability probably all to some extent are difficult to learn to master but there are some that just do not need or practice games to climb easily league bigger and servers are an absoluteThis game is a waste of time for 3 things the community is a total disgust as it is free to play but the reporting system is a total scam and no sense  there are also champions that do not reward your ability probably all to some extent are difficult to learn to master but there are some that just do not need or practice games to climb easily league bigger and servers are an absolute mockery of what the company earns  as they will probably go bad not all the time but when they go wrong take in arreglarlor usually as 4h at least on the server that I play  so just do not bother to download it and if you do that is to play with friends.,8,Good game funny competitive...The game its free and you can spend a lot of hours free you can pay for skins (only visual upgrades) and for  double PI and PX and champs if you wasn't buy it with PI you earn PI playing.You Must Start Play League of Legends the only bads things about this game are the servers/ragers/Op Items or Champs,8,I really did enjoy this game like no other game but unfortunately the game is perfect for you when you just start because you don't care about anything anyone who insults you the server lags the overpriced skins the over powered champions but then league of legends really gets annoying when you are on lvl 30 things change and it isn't as fun as it used to be people judge everything you doI really did enjoy this game like no other game but unfortunately the game is perfect for you when you just start because you don't care about anything anyone who insults you the server lags the overpriced skins the over powered champions but then league of legends really gets annoying when you are on lvl 30 things change and it isn't as fun as it used to be people judge everything you do people critic every single thing you do and you often meet people who troll why do they troll ? No not because its funny because they are annoyed of all the toxic players and troll to get demoted and play with noobs compared to them and i blame the toxic players but toxic players isn't the only problem because the riot employees are laughing at us look the champions that we want to get a nerd instead get stronger.But i still love this game no matter what because its originalfuneasy to learn and you get used to it in 1-2 months.And i find it disappointing to miss such a great opportunity especially with such a good game to get ruined by community so i think only thing for riot to do is to make a new game and put swearnoobget cancer retard and all of the other toxic sentencesand also if someone has a question about will it run yes it runs very easily,7,I have a love hate with this game.

Well I am here to tell you all about my journey in the game and what to expect from this amazing time waster.First of all I will start with my experience. I have been playing this game on and off since the release of Vi which is something like from 2013. Who Am I to write a review? Well I was ranked Platinum 1 in season 5 (not a very high rank but good enough for a review I guess) and currently I am platinum 5 in the new season 6. I have played in many seasons and seen a huge amount of metas. The champion pool is diverse yet the luxurious choice of champions does not matter unless you are in low ELO (aka low rank) or you are a one trick pony. Why u ask? Simple the heuristics of league of legends tell people that X champion with Y build makes him the best/top tier pick. This is where people get the idea of imbalance. Alternatively I don't agree with that but that is off-topic. Lets start with the community.Pros:-Great jokes even the old ones like: Graves's cigar-Very fast learning community (aka creates new metas in under a weeks time)-Cons-Toxic at many points sometimes for no reason. Tbh its not the games fault but the reliance of teamwork.-Will blame others unless you are plat or above.-Depending on rank will have different attitudes for example Platinum Elo has very big ego. Game play.Pros-Recently very balanced unless the game gets staled and the developers unleash a couple of unfair champions.-Very diverse game play choice (you can play from stationary damage dealers to a face roll tank that does not die unless he goes 1v5)-Amazingly looking models and skins making you want to buy them-High skill cap champion pool including the easier champions like (Yi Irelia etc.) Cons.-Miss clicks cost games-Some champions get no changes for years leaving their player base to rot.-Unhealthy kits of champions that can either be mega weak or significantly 'op'. All in all this game is worth any ones time especially if you love MOBA's. Teamwork coordination and individual skill leads all good players to high ranks and if you like these aspects in a game try it out!It's been Tomas and I give this game a solid8/10.,9,I have been playing league for some time now and i love it and i hate it! it a really fun game to play but only when i am playing a group with friends,3,No me gusta practicamente nada.Pocos mapases muy lentopocos personajes y si quieres mas compralos.Yo cuando lo jugue me gusto por 1 semana y ya aburre.Es una opinion personal,3,League of Legends should be a great game but the player base is just toxic. "We are working to improve the community by punishing toxic behavior." is a big lie.I've been playing LoL for four years now.

They have a web site with forums but they read reddit more than they read their own site.  When they do post something it is often a lie or information you could have gotten from a different site weeks earlier.  (how bad is a company when their own web site is the worst place to get info about them...) They started rotating special game modes every weekend but this has more to do with their servers being unable to handle the extra load when they would release gamemodes for special occasions.  Every time urf came out the game would be completely unplayable for at least 3 days due to their servers crashing constantly.  Riot seems completely unwilling to spend any money to upgrade the filthy american servers. Their is really no way to pay for power which is probably the best thing about the game.  With few exceptions the skins you buy do not really add any benefit to game play other than ascetics.  The only way to really gain benefit is to buy some of the stronger champs when you are low level and beat up on noobs (a very common practice that riot has let fester to the point new players will be trolled at least 1 in every 3 games) The game is fun but the company Riot has sabotaged it's own game to the point it is almost unplayable.  Between the Horrible community bad servers bad connections to servers a weird lag issue with comcast that only riot suffers from the unwillingness from riot to listen to their players; I have to suggest people don't bother playing this game since it is much more frustrating than fun.,5,This game was an amazing game to have introduced to you. You had so many characters to choose from to master and you at least had one connection with one of the champions from start. It is fairly easy to learn and get used to at the beginning (though the tutorial could use a bit of work). I've played this game for 4 years now and this whole game is normally a problem as soon as you hitThis game was an amazing game to have introduced to you. You had so many characters to choose from to master and you at least had one connection with one of the champions from start. It is fairly easy to learn and get used to at the beginning (though the tutorial could use a bit of work). I've played this game for 4 years now and this whole game is normally a problem as soon as you hit level 30 I will start with the ranked system. This game has the most horrible ranked system I have ever seen. The ranked system is basically you play a game and if you win your score goes up about 20 points. You lose you go down about 15 points. Before you hit an actual rank you will have to do 10 matches to determine where you should end up. Pretty simple right? Not really. With the addition of how horrible this community is for this game (and I mean horrible) there is a very low chance that you will not have an issue in your ranked game. People fight over stealing kills others making mistakes others losing lane having internet or FPS lag ect... The stuff never stops and all it does is ruin everyone. This leads to my next topic hardware issues. If you have the heart for this game but have really bad internet or a really bad computer I highly recommend NOT to get or play it anymore. If you can't afford a decent PC or internet that is good enough to hold this game not effecting your playing than you cannot play this game. You will only be blamed for it and nobody will cut you some slack. Though that is technically your fault sometimes people can't afford to get what the average league player needs. The enemies also don't care either so they will take any chance they have to kill you whether its fair or not. And that leads me to my next issue dignity. In higher elo's is when this game is actually how it should be. But only 10% of the players that play this game are actually that good (Platinum Diamond ect...) and over 60% of the players who play this game are in the lower elo's (Silver and Bronze). It is what they call "Elo Hell" that is what's in this part of ranking. Elo hell is people hurting each other trying to get up to the top and will do whatever it takes whether its fair or not. Though the champions are really stunning and have awesome costumes and backstories to look into their playstyles sometimes makes you want to hate them till no end. There is never a time when a champion can't be unbalanced. It is always people using the strongest champion at the moment just to win. No heart for the champion just "play to win". In ranked you do have bans yes but either its not enough bans to have or its the fact that a person got destroyed by a person using a skilled champion that is highly unused and just didn't want to see it ever again. The game is never balanced enough for the lower levels and that is completely unfair to 60% of the people who play this game. In higher elo's every character is fairly used and that is because they know every champion inside and out (essentially saying that they played this game non-stop). If a champion is "broken" or "overpowered" at the moment people pick it to win it. That's not dignity it's just how the game works unfortunately. The shop can be another problem. Every champion in the game requires a certain amount of in game money or actual money. Depending on how new the champion is is how much he/she will be in the store. This makes you want to keep playing constantly so you learn one champion after another. Some champions are so low of cost though that it can take one game to have enough (unfortunately those are starting characters that are normally banned half the time because they are ridiculously strong and easy to use). Champions might be one thing but skins are another. You need to buy the champion before the skin but after playing for a while you would want to buy a costume for your favorite character. In my opinion they are overpriced. You can sit there pay 10 to even 30 dollars just for a different color of that champion that did nothing but make you feel like your cool (You won't be unique and stand out because everyone that reaches level 30 at least has one skin. This game has a lot of pros to it such as bringing you and your friends together winning games a lot can reward you highly there is a lot to explore champions look awesome and have cool stories to look into and even gameplay can be easy to get used to but it's internet or PC requirements horrible community un-balancing overpriced store and even the loss of the one thing people rarely have in this game dignity makes this game an easy 5/10 6/10 at the most. I've played this game for 4 years so you cannot say I am not experienced enough to write this.

I think it took me a month of persistent farming to have enough for a ‘tier 1’ champion. The community is trash. The players are homogeneously obnoxious and stubborn 12 year olds and communicating with them is exasperating. The lower bracket is littered with afks laggers and leavers.

And yeah since I've played the game for a while I'll admit that the community is not exactly the most welcoming one ever and yeah it's kinda toxic compared to some other games but most of the matches that I've been in don't involve any arguing or toxicity. Sure I've seen a few flame wars now and then but for the most part the players in the match are mellow. But enough of all that. Of course you want to know why I am such a big fan of this game. I will enlighten you of that right now. So League is a MOBA game about tactics strategy and cooperation among teammates. The gameplay in a match seems pretty slow at first but toward the end of the game it gets very intense and fast-paced. Multiplayer matches usually last 30-50 minutes unless you're in a very high-ranking league. Now for the champions. "Champion" is just another name for the playable characters you play as in matches. And one of the things I love about League is that they have the biggest most massive diverse roster of playable characters to choose from and what's more the developers are constantly adding more characters to the roster. As the developers have said before whatever way you want to get things done there is a champion out there to go with it. In fact one of the funnest parts of playing League is just trying out new champions and seeing what awesome abilities they have at their disposal for you to use. There is a variety of other things I should cover in League But I'll let you find that out when you start playing. So overall League is an amazingly crafted insanely fun and obsessive masterpiece of a MOBA game which is currently the most played online game in the entire world and is also completely free to play.,8,very nice game to spend many hours either alone or in company closely followed by the developers with some updates though sometimes a bit too unbalanced.

Minions kills turrets nexus. Each game drags on and the champions are unbalanced. It's not really a skill-based game but mostly luck -- especially in match-made games. It depends on who you have on your team and who's on the other team. It depends on whether you have a super scaling champion or one that's recently been boosted. Sometimes grievers on the other team afk and you have a free win. Sometimes it's your team. For beginners I recommend not even starting. It's a waste of time and effort. Honestly you'll regret playing. The community is definitely super rude and beginners who start playing pvp or ranked should be prepared to be trash talked like crazy. There's an obvious reason why this is dying down. I'm not even going to start on bugs client crashes and sudden disconnects. Overall the terrible community of people you play with and the toxicity that players are exposed to proves that many players lose enjoyment during the course of this game and forget that league of legends is really just a game that should be enjoyed...since it's not very enjoyable.,7,Ein sehr kompetetives Spiel welches sehr hohen Wiederspielwert mitbringt.

Riot earns money by micro transactions which allows the player to only get cosmetic items to keep the game NOT pay2win. It's my 4th season playing this game and have a solid rank (Platin) which is much better than the avarage rank. Balancing and newbies:Riot patches the game every two weeks to keep it fresh and prevents it for being boring. This is one of the reason why LoL is still so popular. Therefore some champions are overpowered and others are "kinda useless". That creates a meta wich switches over and over so the overpowered champions in the current patch are probably less stronger in the following patches.For newbies: It becomes harder and harder from season to season to get in this game.At the beginning you have to collect and experience much game knowledge to become bad from super bad. You need to play the game for many years to become metionable good in it. So don't get frustrated if you stay forever in silver or bronze. The rest isn't much better than you. Community:The community is one of the games biggest part. When I started the Matches were full of troller inter (people who gave the enemy team advantages with the aim to lose the game) toxic players and afkler. This community changed totally. Today (season 8) there are still those people but  much less than in the past and the rest of the community is really friendly and helpful.The reason for that is probably the honor system which gives friendly and nice player free loot and cosmetic content while the toxic player gets (often) strongly punished for their bad behavior. The influence to the company by the comunity is highly strong. They listen to their community and creating lore content by side the actual game.,
