This game's solo campaign was better than Call of Duty has any right to be. I'll admit right away that I like the solo campaigns of this series, but I always expected a good spectacle and a fun (if dumb) plot at best. Instead, this year we got a game that's out there, among Bioshock, Spec Ops: The Line, Metro: Last Lights and the likes; One of the most intelligent stories I ever experienced in an FPS game. It feels more like a well-written action spin-off of Deus Ex rather than another CoD. It might seem borderline nonsensical at times near the end, but if you read between the lines (quite literally) and give it some thought, it's perfectly logical (albeit with multiple interpretations available). All of this is mixed with the top-notch spectacle you'd expect from this series; Just this time there's some real substance beyond all the explosions. Add good visuals, some great music, and, what's more important, surprisingly good gameplay. The player movement is extremely fluid, cyber powers useful and fun to use, enemies engaging. Yes, enemies - For once, CoD introduced varied enemy types that make the gameplay much more varied and demanding. Oh, and did I mention this game has boss battles?... I'll say that again: Call of Duty has boss battles. The campaign is surprisingly long and replayable. Even more, finishing it unlocks a new game + mode with a different storyline and slightly different missions. Add to that the most fleshed out (and fun as always) Zombies mode yet that just reeks with character and the best multiplayer the series has seen since a long time. Sure, it borrows heavily from Titanfall, but more than makes up for that with decent balance, fun maps, tons of content, and the (nowadays obligatory) addition of unique heroes that add some flavour to the games. Yes, the game did get its share of technical issues at launch (many of which were fixed within the first 24 hours after the release), and the jigsaw plot combined with strongly modified gameplay can feel alienating for old fans of the series, but give this game a chance. For the singleplayer alone, it is worth it. PS. It is incredibly amusing to see people praising Bioshock Infinite for having a complex storyline, and then bashing Black Ops 3 as "incomprehensible gibberish" for doing the exact same thing. It is almost as if our expectations towards games define their quality, and not the games themselves. If it's Bioshock, it has to have a deeper meaning, if it's CoD, it has to be stupid nonsense. I wish people would be more open-minded than that.

And it is really ugly game, that try copy good things from other games like Titanfall etc. One thing, that i say. Dont buy it. Ugly textures, stupid maps of 2000. And campaing? Just stupid

Nov  6, 2015,J4MESOX4D,5,Probably the best Call of Duty in recent years but despite a sterling effort from Treyarch in terms of a content-laden game; it is absolutely clear that the franchise has run its course. Also an inconsistent performance on PC and several old issues that have plagued the series  previous, make this port an extremely disappointing release. Black Ops 3 is contains the usual 5 hour campaignProbably the best Call of Duty in recent years but despite a sterling effort from Treyarch in terms of a content-laden game; it is absolutely clear that the franchise has run its course. Also an inconsistent performance on PC and several old issues that have plagued the series  previous, make this port an extremely disappointing release. Black Ops 3 is contains the usual 5 hour campaign which is painfully linear, overly-cinematic and fails to inspire. The zombies mode will keep fans engaged for a while but if you want the complete experience; you'll need to spend a small fortune on the DLC and wait several months before the content starts flowing. The multiplayer aspect is a vast improvement over Advanced Warfare and Ghosts with fluid mechanics, lots of customisation and some enjoyable maps. Sadly the game is exceptionally buggy with crippling lag, dreadful bullet detection and very repetitive combat. Even the wealth of specialists, weapons and classes can't help the gameplay feel samey throughout. Treyarch were the last hope of salvaging the series and despite a strong offering in terms of a feature-packed title; it's simply not enough which indicates the franchise is at its end. With Sledgehammer and Infinity Ward up next; Activision would be better off calling it a day. Despite the strong positives of BO3; the series fails to have the same impact and quality that it once had and with games like Fallout 4 on the horizon; this game with all its woes will fail to keep you engaged.

[PRESENTATION =4](Graphics = 4) Whatever “tweaks” have supposedly been applied over the years, it still looks like it’s running on an unchanged 2007 CoD4 engine. It takes up 60 gigabytes but looks no better than CoD4 at 8 gig.(Visual aesthetics = 3) The problem with futuristic is that, like MW3 and BlOps2, this just seems sort of bland. I preferred the realism of CoD4:MW, CoD:WaW, and CoD:BlOps1.(Sound Effects = 6)(Voice Acting = 6)(Physics = 2) Bizarrely, CoD continues to program in ragdoll physics but then strangles it by having it activate only after the same stupid pre-animated deaths as before, totally missing the point of ragdoll physics, which is to provide infinite fun ways to watch bodies gib and collapse. Worse, half the enemies are robots that don’t ragdoll at all.Worse, the CoD4 engine has always been very static: almost no background objects react to gunfire. By comparison, games like Stranglehold really make you feel powerful when you have a real, physics-based impact on the world every time your bullets miss.(Plot = 4) Skippable after it loads. [CONTROLS/MECHANICS = 8](95% First-Person Shooter = 8)CoD BlOps3 has the same polished movement and firing scheme as past iterations. Aside from the Halo system, this is the best joystick-controlled shooting you can find, and it’s probably the best mouse-controlled FPS system if you prefer playing that way. It works without doing anything new. But the guns aren't that interesting, even compared to past CoD's; it’s pretty much just machine guns. You have your choice of a recharging “power” (i.e. hack one turret/enemy vs. bee swarm, etc.) but it doesn’t change much, and you can see enemies behind walls once highlighted, which is kind of cool. At least, unlike CoD:Ghosts, you can actually toggle nightvision on/off whenever you want.The thing is, the first-person-shooter as a genre is hardly dead. There are plenty of ways to make it interesting: fun weapons like Painkiller or Bulletstorm; destructible cover and environments like Red Faction or Battlefield:Bad Company; intelligent enemy AI like Half Life; enemies that blow up interestingly like Binary Domain; destroying enemy attack options with careful aim like Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space; or, giant Shadow-of-the-Collossus-like enemies like MGS:Peace Walker. And that's not even talking about combining FPS with other genres (like Deus Ex) or bogging it down with walking-simulator levels (like BioShock).Instead of innovation, we have the 8th expansion-pack to the 9-year-old CoD4.(5% Platforming = 8) The new change, slightly modified from CoD:MW3 (and ripped off of Titanfall), is the ability to jetpack double-jump and wall-run. It works pretty well, and adds a lot to the online multiplayer and certain sections of the single-player campaign, but it’s not a replacement for Mirror’s Edge.(Camera = 5)(Physics = 3)(Friendly AI = 5)(Enemy AI = 6) About half the enemies are robotic killdroids, which unlike the human enemies, can stand there and take a lot of punishment, which encourages taking cover more regularly. Whether this improves or aggravates is a matter of personal preference. [DESIGN = 8](Menus = 5) The 3D home base you walk around in is a wasted concept for what should have been a simple menu.(Level Design = 7) It’s a linear corridor shooter, but you don’t get lost.(Difficulty Curve = 7) Regular checkpoints & co-operative players can revive you.(Upgrade System = 5)(Modes = Singleplayer/2-player splitscreen Cooperative campaign (10 hours, 0% padding), 2 Singleplayer/4-player cooperative Zombie horde campaigns (?), Competitive Multiplayer)BlOps3 does something commendable I haven't seen in an FPS in a long, long time: Splitscreen Co-Op on the PC version. I play alot of local multiplayer, and when we play FPS's that usually means Unreal Tournament 3 (4-player via hidden console commands) or Left-For-Dead 2 (2-player via hidden console commands). Serious Sam 3 is the only AAA-franchise PC FPS I'm aware of where the splitscreen is built-in and not hidden. When Halo 1 and 2 hit PC, Microsoft actually disabled the splitscreen that was already coded into the Xbox versions. Heck, Halo5 no longer offers even console splitscreen, even though fans would assuredly accept halving the supposedly restrictive 60 frames-per-sec to 30 during a co-op mode. For all the vitriol CoD games typically get, everyone should be encouraging this trend at least.Online multiplayer is fun, although I doubt it will still be populated in a year, and I prefer CoD4 online. I never touched the Zombies modes because shooting at slow unarmed enemies always bored me, even in co-op. [CONCLUSION]For all of my criticisms, mainly about the lack of improvements, I had an absolute blast playing through the splitscreen campaign with my friend and I recommend it mainly for that purpose.
Jan  9, 2016,NukaCocaCola,4,The only thing I like about Black Ops 3 is the zombie multiplayer mode, the default multiplayer mode is unbalanced and gets boring after a while. And I absolutely hate the story mode of the game, I had to take drugs to be able to finish it. But I'll give the game 4/10 since I really enjoy the zombie mode. It's however negative that there's only one map so far.

Nov 11, 2015,Dolfann23,9,Black Ops 3 is a very enjoyable addition to the Call of Duty franchise.  The zombies is the best it has ever been, and the multiplayer is very solid and the best since Black Ops 1.  I feel the game does not deserve all these 0/10 reviews that hate on the game because of the title alone.

Im really glad that they reduced the annoying jetpack bouncing by adding the fuel system and removed the buyable supply drops, because these things ruined AW. We all know its not innovative but its a big step in the right direction from CoD, since the last two titles were pretty much a disaster.Overall its a solid, fun game, with lots of content and good balance.

I have absolutely no issues with performance, running the game on high at 120fps 99.9% of the time (i5 3570k @ 4.4GHz / GTX 970) and the anti cheat works much better than what's used by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, so the amount of blatant cheating is minimal in comparison. If you enjoy Call of Duty and have a decent computer you will enjoy Black Ops III, but if you dislike the series in general it won't change your mind.

I'm just going to chalk it up to Treyarch making bad campaigns that are too much like the older last-gen CoDs. I'll be expecting the next two CoDs to have stellar campaigns.
Nov 14, 2015,PinchytheLobby,10,Giving it a 10 to even out the unfavourable reviews, I would give this game an 8/10, smooth motion and gun play. The campaign, multiplayer and zombie modes work well in unison, generally a good all round game to play when you want to relax.

There are problems of lag although you can finally see your ping by pressing Tab, still something doesn't feel right and I guess they will optimized the netcode because some times is infuriating to shoot and not kill with a full clip and to be killed with few shots.Multiplayer maps (like always) I quite forgettable apart from 2-3 and unfortunately BO2 maps were much better at launch, still they need to sell DLC so I'm not surprised any more.Weird is that the thing AW made right (maybe one of the only ones) was the verticality of the maps, in this game there really unexplainable walls and you want to go across them but you cannot and it's stupid and limits the movement of the maps.Technically speaking we finally see some colors specially yellow, and the lighting is well done, some textures are bland and dunno if it is for the graphics card (MSI 970) or the game itself. In any case they are nice, still they could do better for a next gen title. Keep in mind that this is probably a porting from the consoles, so they will always based the game on their perfomances.To conlcude, BO3 is a huge game is terms of content, you will play for a long time if you interested in the mechanics of a fast-paced multiplayer with typical series lag problematics, forgettable campaign and awesome zombie mode.Advice: find 3 buddies and have fun.
Nov 10, 2015,BrownManYash,8,I'm not a fan of CoD. I play CS:GO and Warframe and Ghost Recon Phantoms and Halo. I enjoy tactical play, but a bit of illogical play too. I've never put more than 40 or 50 hours in a CoD game before. I'm telling you this, so people don't call me a fanboy, because I the polar opposite. MY SCORE IS BASED ON IF THE PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLAYER GET FIXED.First off, I just want to get thisI'm not a fan of CoD. I play CS:GO and Warframe and Ghost Recon Phantoms and Halo. I enjoy tactical play, but a bit of illogical play too. I've never put more than 40 or 50 hours in a CoD game before. I'm telling you this, so people don't call me a fanboy, because I the polar opposite. MY SCORE IS BASED ON IF THE PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLAYER GET FIXED. First off, I just want to get this off my mind. This game is graphically intensive, and it should be. We're at a time where graphics and gameplay are a huge deal, and we're at the 2+ GB VRAM requirement for these new AAA games. This game maxed out on 1080p hit 4+ VRAM usage on the CAMPAIGN (I have a gtx 970, so i ran a couple functions at medium and high instead of extra). I was pushing 3+ GB VRAM usage in multiplayer on higher end graphics. I do realize there are some performance issues for even gtx 980 ti for this game, but thy should be cleared soon with a couple of patches coming in. Another year, another CoD. However this time, we're back to Black Ops. And man it feels good. After the past 2 sub-par games (well, Ghosts was a tragedy), Black Ops 3 picks back up the seemingly dying franchise.  Campaign is actually interesting and has damn good twists and secrets (as are the other Black Ops). And having a second campaign is a good addition, and its kind of creepy. And for the people confused by the campaign: Please stop thinking black ops is a mindless shooter fps storyline. Use your brains, and stop mocking the game if you can't "read between the lines" or if you're not willing to think for once (I know I'm being offensive, but it's frustrating to know that this good story is belittled by people who cannot use their brains. There's so much to this story!) Zombies? I don't know, since I'm actually afraid of zombies and I haven't played it (ya I'm a wimp, deal with it). But it looks different from the others. Multiplayer provides smoother play than the last 2 really fast paced CoD  games. And hell, it may be a bit similar in terms of Titanfall parkour, but hey, it isn't a bad addition. And the maps are back to the 3-lanes design, as I believe they should be. HOWEVER, we are having MAJOR performance issues with the game, and the wave of hackers that every fps game has. BUT PEOPLE, THE GAME CAME OUT RECENTLY!!! GIVE TREYARCH SOME TIME FOR PATCHES! And you do realize that Treyarch is giving us PC players modding tools, an exclusive to us only! Funny thing is, this kind of negativity is present on so many new games that have recently come out (cough cough Witcher 3, Dragon Age, Fallout 4). Give the developers some slack. Standards for quality games are rising every year, and game developers put in so much time and money for these games to keep us players happy. There will be bugs and glitches at release. It's inevitable, but as players start pointing out these errors, the developers will make patches. So please people, give some time, and the major problems will be gone. All in all, I enjoy this game. Whether I want to lay off some steam, want some mindless shooting, or just want to relax, this game is worth it. I will try out SnD soon, and hopefully it plays as tactically as CS:GO. My first review,Yash
Nov  6, 2015,Voxel_Fox,9,I Haven't been happy with a call of duty game since the first Black Ops. I am extremely enjoying my time in Black Ops 3! I havn't had any problems with framerate, and it looks and plays damn fine.
Nov  6, 2015,Thiago145,10,Best Call of Duty ever,it delivers an amazing experience with a great port from Treyarch.People may found some FPS drops in the campaign especially if you are using a i5,however PCDEV already said that they are working on a fix for those issues
Nov  6, 2015,Meshuggener,9,If that was the first call of duty game, there would be no COD haters and would be more appreciated...This is a multiplayer game; i havent finished the campain...I love it ! ...may be a little expensive (80$) butconsidering i m gonna play it for few hundred hours, its no big deal then...If you want fast and fun multi fps with nice graphics, buy it ! ; )
Nov  6, 2015,Knutz,9,I'm giving this a 9 because it is the best COD I've played.  BO1 was great, BO2 was meh, but this is by far the best!  Ignore these previous negative reviewers overwhelmingly giving it 0-1's.  E.T(atari from the 80's). deserved a 0-1, but not this.  The least it should get is a 7.5 and that's a solid statement.  They're just BF converts now upset that it's not BF...That's all.  EveryoneI'm giving this a 9 because it is the best COD I've played.  BO1 was great, BO2 was meh, but this is by far the best!

We all should know this by now.It's COD, what'd you expect?!  They've got a lot of new elements to the game, it seems to run and feel solid both graphically and responsive to controls.  I haven't had any of the issues that the others are talking about.  One guy didn't even play it after messing with the settings for 2hrs...but gave it a 1 or something like that.  Hateful community!!As I've stated...It's COD, it's going to look, feel and sound like COD, but I like the new elements they threw into it.  Last COD I played was BO2, so maybe take that into consideration.  It's a good game and I feel I got what I paid for, but I also knew what to expect....I wasn't blown away, but definitely better than what I had expected.AMD 4100Nvidia gtx 560TI8gb ramWindows 7 64.
Apr 13, 2016,mintlo,8,            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I picked up the game a few months after its release and had a difficult time adjusting to the new game mechanics of thrusting but after getting better at it  I enjoy the new challenges with attacking and defending given the new physics.  I'm only talking about the multiplayer portion as I haven't tried the story mode or zombies mode, they don't really interest me as I prefer the challenge of playing against human opponents.  After purchasing the game I saw there was a brief sale offering only the multiplayer portion of the game and I wish that I would have had this purchase option from the get go.  There is a limited player base for PC and I wish they would offer the multiplayer only so as to increase the player base or perfect cross platform play so PC players could play against Xbox and/or Playstation players.  Another issue I have is that instead of showing how many players are active in the BO3 they show a percentage of total players active in a particular game mode.Another issue of contention is scarcity of special one-shot kill weapons that can only be obtained by crates.  I think I know why they chose to do this-scarcity increases demand which caused people to either purchase COD points or play longer in order to be able to get more crates.  However, it is very frustrating to continually play and get killed by the over powered special weapons meanwhile continually striking out on receiving the special weapons.  I'm not going to purchase COD points - I feel that micro transactions such as these are unethical and the creators of the game should be ashamed of themselves. You are taking advantage of peoples addictive behavior in order to deprive them of money and enrich yourselves in the process.  Maybe that's a metaphor for the capitalist paradigm we live in and it's certainly a first world problem.  You know this has got me thinking.  I'm going to sell everything I own and join the peace corp.  Thanks for helping wake me up economic inequalities in the world Treyarch.
Nov 11, 2015,Vertran187,5,Best COD since MW2 but still pretty bad get it 2nd hand in my opinion MP is **** unless you  have a perfect internet connection ur hate it.SP was like COD vs Halo mix up weird dumb and short like the last few games.
Feb 18, 2016,Jacsam,8,I do not like multiplayer. I bought the game for the single player experience.  I thought the graphics and game play were very good.  It also had some interesting weapons.  I do not think a game has to reinvent itself every time it comes out.  This game is a solid FPS and if you like call of duty then you will enjoy this game.

Nov 26, 2015,Munkey,5,Treyarch why? You had three years to make a good CoD and you failed...Campaign is boring and still really a corridor based shooter. You can go vertically up or down but the levels are still just corridors strung together. Story for me was very boring and doesn't really expand the Black Ops universe and the previous build up from BO1 and BO2 was wasted. No back story to the campaign whyTreyarch why? You had three years to make a good CoD and you failed...Campaign is boring and still really a corridor based shooter. You can go vertically up or down but the levels are still just corridors strung together. Story for me was very boring and doesn't really expand the Black Ops universe and the previous build up from BO1 and BO2 was wasted. No back story to the campaign why there was the disaster, why the world is in chaos and why in the first mission we need to save some dude? No back story.Multiplayer is just Advanced Warfare but without the exosuit. Played it but there is nothing new to be honest. Yes the classes with the passive and offensive ability is good but that's it. Maps are diverse and good looking but still on PC lags and cheaters as usual.The only thing that saves this game from a very low score is the Zombie Mode. Again Treyarch does this mode like champs. Zombies are just so good. The look, the voices and the sounds are just amazing. Whoever designed it should get a raise because it's great.For the price you get a lot single, multi and zombies but for me only the Zombie part is worth while.I thing people had enough of future shooters. Would really like to play a World War II shooter again or something like the first Black Ops which to this day is my personal best CoD.Final score for CoD:BO3 is a 5 out of 10.
Feb  5, 2016,Toothlessninja,6,As you can see from the user score, a lot of people don't seem to like this game. Mostly due to the bad PC port (which they have since fixed) and the graphics (they wanted to create a game that could run on 2gb cards so everyone could play). I'm here to tell you that the game isn't that bad. It's not a game I'd call "legendary" by any means, but it's not another Ride to Hell: RetributionAs you can see from the user score, a lot of people don't seem to like this game. Mostly due to the bad PC port (which they have since fixed) and the graphics (they wanted to create a game that could run on 2gb cards so everyone could play). I'm here to tell you that the game isn't that bad. It's not a game I'd call "legendary" by any means, but it's not another Ride to Hell: Retribution like everyone is calling it. -Graphics and port job-I will admit, at release, this game ran like a slideshow on high end pc's. Now after NUMEROUS patches, the game runs flawlessly. I always ran above 60+ fps maxed out 1080p on a lower end pc (AMD FX-6300 and Radeon 7970). They clearly took the time to fix their mistakes and create a good running game now. -Story-The story is... ok at best. It's another one of those "robots kill humans" and "terrorist" plots that you see every other game. It's not really worth the play if you want to play campaign. It's clear that the focus was on the other gamemodes and NOT the story.One thing that I do like is the fact that it is multiplayer. If you want, you can go through the whole campaign with your friends. It'll get a few laughs out of you and your friends playing, even if it is cheesy. -Zombies-One. Map. ONE. MAP. Seriously, GimmieMoneyArch? Yup. There's only one map. Unless you buy the $50 season pass to fuel their Lamborghinis as they swim in money, you only get one map. The season pass isn't even that good right now, it just comes with The Giant from World at War with some updated graphics. Lazy.They did make a lot of changes to the gamemode though. It's a lot for someone who just touched zombies previously to have all of this information shoved in their face at once. It's quite a bit to absorb. Nonetheless, it's fun and got a few hours out of me, but it's nothing to throw $60 at for. -Nightmare mode-This was a lazy attempt for people to play the campaign again, but with zombies thrown in. They don't even change the cutscenes! They just mute the audio from them and slap a narration bit up! It's so lazy to see that they did this. When the game said "zombie campaign", I expected a whole campaign about zombies taking over the world and complex character development (like The Walking Dead or other zombie stories), but I got WAY to ahead of myself. It's also boring and repetitive to just kill nothing but the same zombie over levels you already played. -Multiplayer-This was where the game shines. The shining crown. I put over 200+ hours into this game after about a month of playing. It's a TON of fun and probably the only reason I bought this game.There are now classes or "specialists" as the game calls them, that now diversify play a bit. Each specialist can choose 2 abilities to use that can give them either a weapon or a small advantage for a short period. The classes don't have any personality though. All of them are serious and not funny. Nothing like Team Fortress 2, where each class had a different fun personality. It would've been nice to give the characters some kind of personality besides "Nomad, KIA" and "Ruin, KIA". They had so much potential to put tons of funny character quotes or quips that would've made me remember the characters apart from what they occasionally do every 2 minutes.As for balance of weapons, they need to fix them. Some of the weapons are straight up overpowered.  The P-06, Sheiva, pretty much all smgs, Haymaker, and the Brecci, just to name a few.There are only 12 maps (not including the Nuketown for pre-orders only). Most of them are good and have a lot of ramps and walls for jetpacks. Also, I noticed a lot less camping by allowing almost every part of the map to have 2 entrances to eliminate camping. Sure there were still campers, but rarely any.Speaking of the jetpack, it's a really nice feature I'm glad they carried over from Advanced Warfare. I didn't play AW, but from what I've seen and heard from others, it was nice to have a lot more mobility so combat is a lot more diverse. -Final verdict-I kept playing. I don't know why, but despite all of these flaws, I kept playing. I put over 200+ hours in alone and that for me is enough to justify a $60 purchase.
May 16, 2016,adriandenan,7,It's another CoD game. If you like CoD and want the newest stuff, then yeah it's worth it. It feels like Titanfall without the Titans, which is still enjoyable but still lacking some giant robots.

The zombie mode is still the same as before, just on another map, which is actually a good thing. It also has splitscreen in every mode possible, including the campaign, though the campaign is painfully cringe worthy and not worth a singe play.

Tak monotonnego trzymania palca na spuście powstydził by się chyba nawet Serious Sam.Co do story, to pomysł nie był najgorszy, wręcz powiedział bym, że powiało świerzością, na coś takiego czekałem. Jednak zamiast skupić się na story i rozwinąć temat o agencje rządowe, obecną sytuację na świecie twórcy, skupili się na opowiadaniu nam krótkiej historyjki w rozwleczony sposób. Szkoda, mogło być dobrze a wyszło jak zawsze. Natomiast psychodela, jaką zaserwowali nam pod koniec  ( efekt z ptakami), odradzanie zastrzelonych wrogów, to coś, co nigdy nie powinno znaleźć się w tego typu grze. Gameplay poległ, wytrwałem do końca dla story i nie chcę więcej tej gry oglądać.
Nov 16, 2015,Tgc,5,It really depends what are your expectations. If you want a decent FPS you will be disappointed. If you want b-genre interactive action movie then you could be satisfied.
Dec 26, 2015,Bobk,8,I don't know why people hate this game so much. It is another Call Of Duty tittle so not much has changed but it is still way better that Advanced Warfare and it can't be compared to the absolute disater Ghosts. The game offers a lot of content, from guns to perks to specialists. I would give it a third spot in the franchise ,right after Black Ops 2 and COD 4: MW.
Jan 22, 2016,CuteHat,8,Leading up to the release of Black Ops III, I played the Modern Warfare Trilogy, followed by the firs two Black Ops games, just to get a feel for the series as I'd never really played any of them before.

While I didn't enjoy any of the modern Warfare titles very much and I can understand where the negative stigma surrounding Call of Duty came from because of them, I have to admit that the Black Ops have just been getting better and better, and Black Ops III is the best yet. It's hard to even describe in words how well put together this movement controls in this game really are. Being able to slide out of cover and double jump into a wallrun, and still look around freely and shoot with your weapon is pretty fun, to say the least, and the maps in both single and multiplayer are all clearly built around these mechanics. Honestly it's the little features that made the campaign so enjoyable, the biggest one being: no **** They even throw in this advanced HUD you can toggle on and off that shows tactical information, including areas where you're likely to get pinned down, something that always seemed to happen on higher difficulty levels of the other CoD campaigns. Streamlined is the best word to describe this experience. You choose your favorite guns, stick with them the whole level, changing loadouts as needed, and level them up to get more and more attachments, a really satisfying progression method that also gives my weapons a bit of a personal flavor as I customize them to my liking. The thing that defines the Black Ops games for me, in comparison to other CoDs, is the player character's importance and presence in the scenes. You are not simply the cameraman, your character talks to other characters and they talk back, it seems simple but honestly after being treated as nonexistent in the Modern Warfare games, the Black Ops games do a good job of making you feel meaningful, and I give props to Black Ops III for going the extra mile and letting you choose your character's sex, and still recording a full script of dialogue options for both voices. I was worried they were going to cut down on costs and time by just giving you no dialogue, but indeed they stayed true to the series' strong points. The actual story itself is interesting enough; I remember the trailers making me think this was going to be a Deus Ex Human Revolution rip-off, but in the end it was its own thing--a military shooty-story, but replete with unique bossfights that give you a sense of progression as you tackle them one by one. And let's not forget, they actually managed to fit a Nazi Zombies level into the single player campaign, which amused me to no end. Co-op is great fun as well, as you generally only have one set of abilities for your character (melee, hacking, or sabotage, basically), and have another person there with a different set of abilities really changes things up. Taking control of a flying drone and providing some covering fire while my friend charged in with her melee-centric abilities to break up a group of enemies was a pretty damned satisfying maneuver, and definitely not the only one of its kind. While the game is not some ground-break landmark in gaming, it is still great: it has a diverse set of tools and it fits them all together perfectly. It's fun, fast, and satisfying to play through, and even as someone who used to have no interest in Call of Duty ever before, i can still confidently give Black Ops III an 8 out 10.

Zombies is still as good as ever, the campaign, its co-op, and the nightmare mode add plenty to the overall package, while the currently barebones freerun mode can be beaten within 20 minutes. However, the PC port is poor compared to the console. You may want to take a raincheck on this game while they fix the problems with the port and add modding support
Nov 13, 2015,grimmzy,5,Honestly would be quite fun if it wasn't for god awful PC optimization, the only people that don't agree with this are mindless fanboys, the release state was horrible, it uses unjustifiable amounts of resources on any graphical setting, and as of a week later still no patch or acknowledgement from the devs.
Mar  4, 2016,lasn,8,The game had a bad launch, but it was fixed pretty fast (for me atleast). I think that is the reason for the low user score. 2.7 out of 10 is absolutely too low. Game is alot of fun. My first COD game. I have over 150 hours played now. Well worth the money.

I didn't have any of the lag or lock up issues on my system, and my rig is far from OP (Asus Z77 Sabeertooth / i7-3570K / MSI GTX 970 4g), and even with my rig I was still able to run at full graphics options with no performance issue....even ran 60+ fps the entire time. My biggest beef was with the gameplay.  The story was interesting, and had just enough of a twist that I saw coming but didn't mind when it happened.  But....some of these missions are HELLA long!!!   Literally spent almost 45 minutes on a single mission in campaign...now while many will ask "you want a short game then?"....no.   I don't want short, but at the same time, having a single run last almost an hour is a bit much. The AI difficulty needs to be looked at as well.   Even running through the campaign the first time on "I'm a wimp" mode, I was still finding myself regularly getting dead.  Mostly from the robots in the game.  And don't even get me started on the assault on the last mission.  ENDLESS WAVES OF ROBOTS between you and your objective to simply hack a door. All in all though, it was fairly solid.   Will I be playing it again?  Maybe in a few months when I get bored of World of Warships or something else.   Until then...I will go back to Mass Effect 2.

This has been said by man fans.It develops over disaster of Advanced Warfare, it adds  to nice colours and map design of  Black Ops 2.2 main problems we have are : Supply drop system and cod fanboys who hate on all futuristic movement mechanics.If the game had NO micro transactions, then I would give higher score, but it deserves 8/10.
Oct  4, 2016,vasak,0,The most big ridiculous ending game never seen.... Bad Performance, maybe this game is developed under some type of drugs... cant understand how can they think, anyone want this.
Nov  3, 2016,Shekky,3,This game is a total rip off of titanfall 2 without the mechs portion. The Gameplay is somewhat decent but still in the same boat of futuristic shooter that is not at all what activision should be working on.
Mar 18, 2017,Tomle1202,6,The story that Call of Duty: Black Ops III tries to offer the complicatedness expected from a Black Ops game, but the way Treyarch delivers such attraction is just as unappealing as its missed potentials and horrific optimization.
Jan 19, 2017,tangosucka,5,When advanced warfare was released back in 2014, i thought it was okay, not great, but okay, if only i had known what horror i would diving into the next year, call of duty black ops 3 is a game that suffers from bad writing, awful dialog and voice acting  reminiscent of a low budget 80s action movie, the multiplayer is pretty much the same as advanced warfare, but you can now make yourWhen advanced warfare was released back in 2014, i thought it was okay, not great, but okay, if only i had known what horror i would diving into the next year, call of duty black ops 3 is a game that suffers from bad writing, awful dialog and voice acting  reminiscent of a low budget 80s action movie, the multiplayer is pretty much the same as advanced warfare, but you can now make your character dance at the end of a match, we asked for improvement and this is what they give us -_- the campaign pretty much has nothing to do with the first two games and the characters are incredibly boring and underdeveloped, as well as completely irrelevant to the first two games,  in a more technical point of view, the game seems to run just fine on the ps4, it mostly runs at 60fps but occasionally drops to 30 when things get hectic, the pc version from what i can tell is badly optimised and performs poorly even on up to date hardware, the last gen versions are multiplayer and zombies only, and are terrible, the graphics are even worst than the pc version at lowest settings, the resolution seems to somewhere around 480p, and the game seems to run between 60 and 2fps, the framerate is so inconsistent, id be better off playing the game through a slide projector, do not buy the last gen versions unless you buy it for extremely cheap or have way too much money, overall black ops 3 is completely irrelevant to the first two games, the multiplayer is average, and the game has a few technical issues, would i recommend it? If your a cod fan then the game might be worth it, but for me, it was a complete waste of 60 quid
Nov  4, 2016,jelikey,7,Another AAA game with severe technical issues?! Wow, just... wow. How this stuff continues to get released is baffling, and completely unacceptable. The game itself is decent if you can run it properly. It adds a few new, interesting things, but ultimately doesn't expand beyond what we expect from a typical COD game.

Jul 13, 2016,YoloSwag4Doge,9,It's true that the regurgitated CoD releases year after year can get rather tiresome, but I've got to give major props to this installment.

Treyark has really become their own and I find their CoD installments have much better quality and ingenuity in general than Activision's. I've noticed that Activision has been adopting a lot of Treyark originals like Zombies, enhanced abilities and futuristic weaponry over the years. While the CoD multiplayer is essentially just more of the same, the campaign is very well done. You won't find the notorious CoD element of endlessly spawning enemies that basically force you to always be charging through gun fire in order to advance. Instead BO3 offers well designed levels with engaging fire fight environments and some rather neat extras. The super human jumping, running and special abilities are very well done and I personally find it much more fun than Advanced Warfare's titanfall mechanics. All in all, anyone who's bored silly of the CoD experience isn't going to find anything exceptional in BO3. But to anyone who's still got a bit of the CoD spirit in them, I highly recommend BO3 for the overall improved combat, characters and level design. Also the the game is well optimized and runs at steady frame rate. (As a side note I found a couple of the voice actors a bit lacking in their performance, but for the most part the voice acting is quite good).

Feb 27, 2017,lhmtgame,2,The BO3's story is not impressed. Finishing the game without any feeling!Game's graphics look like COD 2006. Just like Activision convert COD from Console to PC without optimized it.  A lot of people get FPS drop while playing and have no any support to fix it... me neither.

Glad I didn't buy it.
Aug  7, 2016,Lone_Wolf_Sones,2,For a series that has prided itself on its 60 fps gunplay Black Ops III on PC is another shoddy port that suffers from lack of optimization. Stuttering is so frequent as to render the game unplayable. Highly recommend waiting to see if the issues are fixed. If you already have bought it you can get a refund through Steam.
Dec  3, 2016,Shatter77,3,*Single player only review* Words can barely convey how awful the campaign is. It attempts to tell a kind of cyberpunk story of technology run amok. It is utterly inept at even keeping your attention while at it.

As the plot gets clearer though, it becomes obvious how derivative and pedestrian it is. Treyarch delivers the story with totally misplaced bombast and freighted with emotion and meaning as if you haven't seen this stuff many times before in other games and film. The final mission, with your character railing and ranting is particularly cringe worthy.  This is by far the worst Call of Duty I have ever played. Also, the music is terrible. I had all sorts of technical issues, like your gun not producing any sound, crashes to desktop, this a year after release. What a piece of ****
Sep  4, 2016,Greggg,3,This is an excellent game, but the servers forced me to rate it so low.  They are many times disconnected at zombies.  I dont know for multi.  It's so annoying
Sep 16, 2016,hawkeye766,6,Having been a bit out of the gaming loop as of late, and having some friends that played this game, I decided to check it out.  I was enticed at first, but I quickly became bored. I first played the zombies mode, which brought about an interesting premise but as a casual player i really couldn't get much farther than about the sixth level, which made it frustrating.  Especially becauseHaving been a bit out of the gaming loop as of late, and having some friends that played this game, I decided to check it out.  I was enticed at first, but I quickly became bored. I first played the zombies mode, which brought about an interesting premise but as a casual player i really couldn't get much farther than about the sixth level, which made it frustrating.  Especially because zombies has become less of an amusing arcade mode and actually features a narrative, which I'd really like to experience, but cannot because I lack hours to devote to a game that starts over when you die.This brings me to the campaign, which I have always thought to be CoD's most redeeming aspect.  This was a really lazily developed story that had some fun parts, and dealt with some interesting Ideas that, if properly synthesized, could have made a decent experience. It just didn't though.  In my opinion CoD is just too far in the future now to create a well grounded story. They try to provide the thrill of Geopolitical turmoil, but since you know next to nothing about the pieces at play, the political side of the game is just really flat.  BO3 is also fettered by a cruddy customization system that leaves you finishing the campaign far below your potential.  Not that it matters much because the objectives pretty much consist of running over here, running over there, (on a wall this time), and flying this way.  Pouring as much ammunition as possible into whatever bullet sponge of an enemy thats shooting at you right now.  Basically all your enemies are robots now, so you have to shoot everything twice as much.As for the most popular part of the CoD experience,  multiplayer can be fun, but its mostly just a matter of fast movement.  As a casual gamer, i started out just getting demolished by a bunch of experienced players with extremely fast awareness and reflexes.  It is more or less a matter of who sees who first, because all elements of fps tacticality have been all but eliminated.  This sounds like a joke, but its actually impossible to check corners or use angles to your advantage in any way because of the map design.  It can sometimes be enjoyable, but after playing the battlefield beta, this multiplayer, and really this whole game are a largely pleasureless experience for me.
Mar 24, 2017,KittyWhisky,6,Continued amazing series of Black Ops I was absolutely not expecting this. I think many did not expect this to continue. Doubt crept in since the announcement - the game has a cooperative. But co-op kills the narrative. The plot in Black Ops 1 and 3 was intriguing and crazy, the characters were wonderful. In the story it turned out better than I expected. The plot is very ambitious, butContinued amazing series of Black Ops I was absolutely not expecting this.

The plot in Black Ops 1 and 3 was intriguing and crazy, the characters were wonderful. In the story it turned out better than I expected. The plot is very ambitious, but unfortunately it's not an RPG, and the writers failed in a shooter to submit a clever plot. What happened in the end we can only guess, as the writers gave us enough clues to get a complete picture. Gameplay with the last part changed, mainly because of the abilities is a good find and nicely dilutes the gameplay. It is a pity that combining styles is possible too late level. A lot to pass this game not everyone wants such a sad story (sad for Call of Duty series and Black Ops). I especially missed you at the stages when you need to gradually destroy the robots is boring. The multiplayer in the beta I really liked. On release, he was absolutely unplayable because of the lag and terrible ping. Repaired it for a very long time, and now to play it is not even desirable. Zambi the regime has become more entertaining, since we are in the unusual setting, and this mode is fun as usual. Although, why should it play, if there are more good games for shooting zombies. Black Ops 3 is not a sequel, which I shook. For Treyarch it is a huge step back. Graphics are surprisingly bad, much worse than in Advanced Warfare. Why you can recommend? In the story there are interesting locations, a bit of surrealism, very good gameplay - a fun run around, kill everyone, and move on to use abilities.

May 10, 2017,Xxdaniels751xX,1,I bought it almost out for about 50 euros and was not disappointed, the good thing is that it complies with what it offers; Quick games, very simple and little more, a CoD like the ones of each year, I do not recommend the purchase to date because there are almost no people playing. If you liked the zombies of Black Ops or you happen to buy this game.
