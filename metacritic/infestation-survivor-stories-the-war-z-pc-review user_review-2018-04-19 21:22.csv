2,Awful simply awful. the only thing worse than the fact that they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING is the online community. If this is the future of MMOs then I'm ready to get off the train. What do you expect from the developer that brought you the proclaimed worst game of all times Big Riggs. This game is a worthy followup.,0,Trash game is trash. I feel sorry for anyone else that has paid for this game.  I'm doing all I can for a refund.  I have felt robbed since day one.  I have learned from my mistakes.,3,This game begins with a good idea and ends with utter disappointment. I was a big fan but can't stand the constant cheating (Google search it) and the developers inability to do anything about it. For anyone that has purchased the game - go download War Inc. for free and compare. It's the same game with different models. You just paid for a mod of a FREE game.,0,The developers are a scam. The game released as an alpha with no indication it's still an alpha. They're only cashing in on the DayZ hype. They should be sued for false advertisement and much much more. They should be ashamed of themselves.,3,The Game description makes War Z sound like the perfect Zombie game however the Developers lack of fulfilling promises has really gone on too long. With Previous promises of certain features in the "Foundation Release" coming in December only to be met with "1-4 Weeks" until the features listed on Steam may actually be in-game.

With Previous promises of certain features in the "Foundation Release" coming in December only to be met with "1-4 Weeks" until the features listed on Steam may actually be in-game. I could put up with the same models as War Inc and the bugs if only the Developers could meet their deadlines and carry out their promises. Hackers are a problem as well as false bans which have since been corrected. I love the concept - Dislike the execution.,0,I didn't think it was possible for anyone let alone game developers to spew out more lies and empty promises than a politician! The game is apparently in it's "foundation release" and yet looks no more complete than it's initial Alpha release. I would not recommend this game to ANYONE and I actually am disappointed in myself for falling for such a money-grabbing scam,0,While the game had potential the devs and the moderators have abused and suppressed facts and opinions on their forums. They are skirting the line of ethical values and seem to push for a "release title" then to work to finish up the game. This is not a AAA title more like a C title at best. I could go into great detail but this is a game to revisit in a few months. Also the map is aWhile the game had potential the devs and the moderators have abused and suppressed facts and opinions on their forums. They are skirting the line of ethical values and seem to push for a "release title" then to work to finish up the game. This is not a AAA title more like a C title at best. I could go into great detail but this is a game to revisit in a few months. Also the map is a fraction of the size it was going to be and changed the wording many times since Oct 15th alpha. Nothing is on schedule with them and core components are pushed back all the time. The good is if you like a CoD style game with some zombies around play it for the fun of others misery. If you want a survival experience then you will have a long wait ahead of you. Ohh and no friends system set up or away to tell who is a friendly type or a bandit since you have to type to chat and get killed for that. So no VOIP in-game makes it very hard to play with randomly met people.,2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Really really bad. I tried it out while it was in "alpha/beta". I saw great potential in it but as they were getting closer and closer to the release date I basically saw devs that didn't really care about the game but more or less the money they could make from hopping on the DayZ bandwagon. Now that the "foundation build" is out nothing has changed.The map is stillDO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Really really bad. I tried it out while it was in "alpha/beta".

Now that the "foundation build" is out nothing has changed.The map is still buggy the textures are horrible and most importantly almost all of their promises were never met (cars strongholds etc). If the game has been in development for as long as they claim it's been I expected more and I'm basically extremely disappointed. Again this game HAD potential but this game jsut blows.,4,Gameplay is fun but cant say much else. Most unprofessional DEV team I've ever dealt with. Break deadlines regularly called players a **** on official forumsspawn in guns teleport in public servers etc. Check on the game in 6 months IF its still around MAYBE take another look....As for now.. .Stay away.,3,In the games current state it is nothing more than a first person shooter and not a good one at that. No one really hunts the zombies actually the game is more like run in a pack and just kill other players its not really and mmo until the kill on site aspect is addressed.

Hammerpoint is making every attempt to clean out your wallet. They continue to fill the game with broken promises and it seems maybe they cannot deliver what they have actually would be in the game at this point. It really seems that they have spent more time figuring ways to make money than actually fixing the things that are broke in the game e.g glitchy hill drops to your death erratic out of place game sounds bad AI optimized graphics.,3,Does this look like a minority of bad reviews? From the looks of it lots of people are angry. Angry that we were duped by misleading information that the Director stated is ok to do.,3,I like playing the game but their CONSTANT AND CONSISTENT lies have bored me. They have CLEARLY rushed this out no matter what they claim. Has all the potential for a brilliant game if only they spent some of the money from preorders on hiring more developers rather than gold plated suits.

As a developer I understand development hold ups but the problem they face is claiming to have features for "private test groups" that they dont have AT ALL! Its not just delayed features its stuff they have not even started work on! For gods sake the community/clans page does not even refresh you have to LOG OUT to get the new data. From a programming perspective making something like that refresh is the least taxing problem out there just re run the same code that fills it. TLDR;Promising game thats fun to play but constant lies and delays are tiresome.,2,Dreadful. Not being a player of DayZ but aware that my friends and others had enjoyed it I quickly saw this game (The War Z) and made the connection that it was the stand alone DayZ that I had previously heard rumors of. Now I'm willing to accept that I'm at a lot of fault for buying this game on impulse without doing any research and I quickly found out after I had bought the gameDreadful. Not being a player of DayZ but aware that my friends and others had enjoyed it I quickly saw this game (The War Z) and made the connection that it was the stand alone DayZ that I had previously heard rumors of. Now I'm willing to accept that I'm at a lot of fault for buying this game on impulse without doing any research and I quickly found out after I had bought the game but before I had played it that it was not any actual version of DayZ but rather an imitation I was a bit concerned. Still I tried it out with some optimism; it couldn't be terrible but how wrong I was. The game is far from complete. Now this in itself is no real crime; plenty of games are played before they are complete yet they evolve into something much greater over time. The real tragedy here is that it makes no mention of it's Alpha stage before you purchase it. It indeed presents itself as a full and complete game. Now even then that's not to say the game couldn't be fun. Yet while some tend to enjoy it it would seem a good majority does not. (including myself) There's nothing that really orients you towards any sort of goal. Now this is also sometimes a good thing hell it worked for Minecraft but in this case there isn't really too much to actually grasp and adapt to in the game. Focus in the game is not born through the mere playing of it in my experience. Survival quickly becomes a chore rather than a game. On the flip side things look pretty from a distance and zombies in the game do scare the hell out of me so the game isn't totally lacking in potential. Just you know as is don't touch it.,0,I'm not a fan of zero bombing but this is out of principle. This game should not be allowed to be sold at least as it is right now.

Good luck meeting your end-of-2012 launch deadline. I hope the lawsuits don't slow you down.,0,Game has a long list of features none of which are in the game.

This is a company you need to stay far far away from. Anyone interested in this game please be advised anything you see in screenshots or in writing from them is NOT IN THE GAME THEY ARE SELLING.,1,It's hard to explain how bad this game actually is. It is so damn glitch! Also you pay for a Beta game and not a full game!!! Also there are transactions in the game that does not justify the fee you pay for the game it self. Be smart and stay away from this game please!,3,I really want this game to succeed and it does have potential but at this rate the game is barely getting any better and the developers keep pushing back dates for things that they promised beforehand.,3,Big Rigs comes to mind when playing this game. It's unfinished and plagued by bugs exploits and hacks.At first I believed the promises of the developers and decided to just wait it out but Hammerpoint is like that prostitute you just paid and then she admits to you that she has no vagina but too bad she runs off with your money anyways.,3,This game should definatley be in the free-to-play section of steam as it has micro-transactions in it and is in an alpha stage (although said to be the full game in the description with plenty of features that aren't even present in the current build).

Item bought in the marketplace with real cash are not permanent and will be lost immediately upon death - which happens often considering this is a zombie survival game. With all of that in mind I advise you to hold onto your cash  and either wait for the complete game or the standalone Day Z.,1,Not at all what they advertised on steam when i bought it. Not at all what they advertised on their website. Took a peek in the forums and saw all the rage and still bought it. I should have listened. This game may be what it supposed to be in a year but it definitely isn't right now.,0,This is by far one of the very worse games i have ever played and i have been playing video games sense the late 70's it has no objectives or anything resembling a mission all you do is walk around for hours to get anywhere just to die by a horde our get killed by another player when you get to where ya wanna be.So many things are broken about it if you die it can be hours before youThis is by far one of the very worse games i have ever played and i have been playing video games sense the late 70's it has no objectives or anything resembling a mission all you do is walk around for hours to get anywhere just to die by a horde our get killed by another player when you get to where ya wanna be.So many things are broken about it if you die it can be hours before you can respawn unless you pay real money for it and when you do you start without the items you originally started with which is crucial.Warning! don't buy items from market unless your willing to lose them upon death this game is nothing more than a money maker.,0,This game is dreadfully bad! Probably one of the worst games I've played this year. Clearly not finished by any stretch of imagination. Not to mention the Dev's bad business practice and their immature anti-consumer behaviour. This game will get zero points from me!,0,This is a buggy uninspired mess which looks like it was made in 1996 and runs about as well as if it had. The developers were caught out selling it as a complete and full featured game and even when it is clearly an alpha at best.

That is how much they respect you the Consumer.,0,The idea of the game is good. But overall With the current developers this game is doomed. They do nothing but create more ways for them to make money. They have a HUGE hacking problem and they fail to address us about it.  Every time ANY criticizes them they ban their account.

To all who have bought into this stop playing..,3,I bought this game a few days ago with the understanding that it is primarily a zombie survival MMO with pvp elements. This could not be further from the truth. This game is a fragfest free-for-all where the zombies pose a small threat in comparison to the large amount of "bandits" who play the game primarily to ruin other players' experience. Almost none of the promised features have beenI bought this game a few days ago with the understanding that it is primarily a zombie survival MMO with pvp elements. This could not be further from the truth. This game is a fragfest free-for-all where the zombies pose a small threat in comparison to the large amount of "bandits" who play the game primarily to ruin other players' experience. Almost none of the promised features have been implemented including a skill system or a reputation system to curb the prevalent kill-on-sight mentality plus the developers' promise that the game will not be play-to-win has been broken many times over by adding ammunition food beverages and many other items which provide an enormous advantage to people who spend real money on these micro-transactions. The patch today increased the wait time for revive after death from one hour to four hours while conveniently adding an option to pay real money to revive immediately. This is so shady... I had high hopes for this game and honestly the time I have spent playing when I wasn't being ganked (by would-be sociopaths who could care less about zombies when there are people to kill) has been enjoyable. I love the scavenging aspect. Getting chased by zombies is truly terrifying. The night time is very very creepy. There is so much potential but the devs seem to be ignoring the most urgent problems and even working against fixing them at times while releasing patches that are underwhelming to say the least. Overall I would counsel any potential buyer to wait until some of the balancing features are added before spending the money. I am one of many who is seeking a full refund and I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same disappointment I and many others have gone through. One last thought: Entire clans (guilds) are leaving this game in response to today's patch. This should communicate something of the seriousness of the problem this game and its crew are facing if major changes are not make soon. Buyer be warned.,0,This game is **** The developers are **** I bought a Pioneer key (U$S29.99) on Oct 16th been playing a while so I know a bit about this "game".

The so called anti-cheat is a LIE. They say the ban cheaters that´s a lie they just ban random people so they can buy their piece of **** "game" again. Only thing positive I have to say is that luckily after a fight of 2 weeks with "game support" and my credit card costumer support I got the full refund. DO NOT BUY THIS. THIS GAME IS A SCAM! Ask the former War Inc community these guys are the same devolpers they abandoned that game to make this cash-grab of a game.,4,Would love this game if it was handled in a totally different manner. Every move by the Devs have put a quick buck over the long term success of this game. Missed deadlines and early release of a build that has not been improved much since closed alpha. Currently this game is not something I would recommend to my friends and that is a shame since it could easily be the game of my dreams.Would love this game if it was handled in a totally different manner.

Many features listed on Steam are completely missing. The price was reduced to less than $15 in order to squeeze as much money from the game before it dies. I repeat: do not purchase this game you will not get what you think you are getting. The game is also pay to play and it has an free to play store to milk for even more money.

I'm especially frustrated because the game has potential but this is the worse company so far I've seen with borderline illegal commercial practices. I'm so pissed at them since I've met some great people in the game but I don't trust them so I have to speak against them until they change their practices.,1,Pre-ordered the game early October and was in since the first few hours on the 15th.

There is essentially no game features implemented as of yet and even the animations and environments which they all borrowed from the free to play game they based the game off.  If you've played War Inc. think of having a bunch of nearly harmless npcs running around and a few weapon reskins.  The overwhelming lack of professionalism from the developers is incredible as you can easily find with a quick search.  Misleading is the best word you can use for their sporadic communication.  This game will end up free to play if it ever does make it to an actual 'Release' by any proper standards.  Do not buy this game.  You will regret it as I do.,2,After giving this game the benefit of the doubt after accepting and being aware of the fact that it is Alpha/beta test and that I've only pre-ordered the game whilst being "allowed to test"..

Sergey Titov you and your community/forum moderators are slowly no quickly destroying destroying this game by getting rid of anyone who posts suggestions that may be negative towards your game. I gave the game 2 out of 10 because it has potential to not derail itself but land back firmly on its tracks. Though with all these shambles you keep making I believe you may have no idea how to fix this. In my opinion this is a huge shame as I enjoyed the promises you gave us but if I am truly honest I have lost all faith that you will deliver on half of them let alone all. P.S this is coming from someone who wasn't that impressed by Day Z. Before anyone claims I am a Day Z fan boy.,0,This game is a poorly done imitation of other Zombie survival games. It lacks originality and direction and gives the appearance of being out for a fast buck. I am surprised that steam would even offer a game like this,1,One of the biggest jokes in gaming this century. Complete and obvious lies from the developers on a regular basis. This is rumor or opinion it's fact. And I don't mean simple errors in patch contents or anything they have bare face lied on a number of occasions. The game itself could have some potential if it wasn't for the complete idiocy of the developers and moderators.,0,Wow..I prefer to comment on the games that I actually love and I'm usually on the defending side when it comes to flame wars but I HAVE to criticize this game because this kind of behavior is just unacceptable. The game has absolutely nothing that improves upon DayZ which this game is copied from. If this game took the elements from DayZ and made it better I'd call it a good game.

The game has absolutely nothing that improves upon DayZ which this game is copied from. If this game took the elements from DayZ and made it better I'd call it a good game. If it was exactly the same a rip-off. Now I don't know how to call it if it actually took most of the elements from DayZ and made it worse added a pay-to-win micro-transaction items that get destroyed upon death. Yes there's a pay-to-win in-game shop and yes you lose the purchased items if your character dies. This is terrible for both the ones that buy the items and those who don't while devs take the money. The graphic's very bad aside from some of the skies yet poorly optimized. Terrible sound effects aside from gun sounds. The UI is meh and the FoV is so limited. Gameplay is downright boring and the map is too small and poorly designed. The game is pretty much in early-Alpha stage yet they sell the game as if it's finished and even advertise the features that aren't even in the game. This is unacceptable! I've always hated those enraged 0 rating votes but I'd actually give this game minus score if there was one. I don't care if you get enough enjoyment out of this for $14. Don't support this kind of behavior!,1,Absolutely sickening. I had the displeasure of getting a guest pass a week or two ago to try this title and within 10 minutes I had enough.

Hammerpoint Studio lead Sergey Titov is notorious for helping design some of the worst games ever received (Big Rigs: Over the Road) and War Z is no exception. All this company and him want is money and they are trying to cash in on the success of Day Z. Visuals are dreadful and the optimization rivals such polished titles as GTA IV for PC. Sound is terrible. Gameplay is 100% completely identical to Day Z however it's done MUCH worse (and keep in mind Day Z is in ALPHA). To also try and make more money they added in a cash shop which most people know DOES NOT BELONG IN A GAME LIKE THIS. The company randomly bans people (mostly users with high game time as they think it will make them buy the game again) hesitant to offer refunds (luckily since I never owned the game I never had to go through this) blatantly lies bans people criticizing the game. They are shady and I wouldn't trust them with my money. The company is shady unprofessional (Sergey Titov can barely speak english) and the game is also a rushed unpolished abomination that they are trying to sell now in these stages as they know when any professional reviewer plays this load of turd it will be panned AS IT SHOULD.,2,This game is defined as an MMO. Despite this it is definitely not an MMO. Massively Multiplayer pertains to a persistent world which does not exist in this game. Instead you have servers with "batches" of 50 people you can play with. The texture quality especially the grass is quite awful.

It is impossible to see in grass while proneing at all. The money shop gives players huge advantages for those that use it and really punishes players that dont. The game on STeam also says an 100km world and multiple maps despite the fact that War Z only currently has 1 map and it is not even 100km. The game is very much INCOMPLETE. I could go into horrible detail about how this game has missed the mark. I could understand if this game was an Alpha. However this is supposed to be version 1.0 and version 1.0 is a disaster. Not a good buy dont waste your money.,0,Horrible game. It is ridden with bugs and runs like **** on even great computers. Avoid this game at all costs and just wait for DayZ standalone to come out.,0,Horrible badly designed game. A blatant rip off of DayZ and not even a very good one. Makes you pay for the alhpa and then still has a real money cash shop. Filled with hackers and bugs not worth the money. Check out Totalbiscuits video on it to see just how bad it is.,4,I think they could have a great game here. Just when we start thinking there are some good things going on they make updates and changes that are again for more money to play and win.

Items you buy with real money will be lost if you die. half of the advertised features on the steam store page are not even implemented. it basically looks and plays like an alpha. it is clearly unfinished but they actually charge their alphatesters money.,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        The developers don't know what they are doing with this game and most of the promised features are not in the game yet.They even unban cheaters when they ask for it because their anti-cheat doesn't work properly.,2,OK hammer point has lied to the community and numerous occasion's and ban's way to many innocent people for there so called anti cheat   witch has many flaws if its even real and doing ban's on illegal placed items is absurd.Banning people on forums for them speaking there mind on the game is also absurd.So much for treating the community  good.,3,Well I bought this game some months ago as an alternative to DayZ since my friend could not play it and I will admit it was fun for a great while and i managed to cope with the sporadic changes in everything they felt was needed. (not to mention the dev team is the single absolute worst team i have ever had any form of contact with not to mention incredibly unprofessional) Then cameWell I bought this game some months ago as an alternative to DayZ since my friend could not play it and I will admit it was fun for a great while and i managed to cope with the sporadic changes in everything they felt was needed. (not to mention the dev team is the single absolute worst team i have ever had any form of contact with not to mention incredibly unprofessional) Then came the "release" of the game on Steam naturally it comes with publicity and the general public was not the clingy well known fanbase they possessed at an earlier date so upon receiving criticism the updates got a little more out of hand. Which cause the almost constant neglect of their patrons to become quite a problem and would mask completely out of the blue updates with that the community asked. Then the consistent micro-managing came along as if the marketplace wasn't enough of a foreign element they quadrupled  the spawn time simply to make another quick buck (mind you hacking cheating and common game breaking glitches have been in since the release) so they wait until the last minute when they are cornered by unfunded review makers to changed what the community has been asking for the entire lifespan of this game now. And if this list and many more things were not ruining the game already They have LOWERED the standard price of the game $10 and RAISED the reward of paying $25 for people after the "release." If it were not for the fact I actually have a decent account going for some months now I wouldn't bother with this release at all. Save your money for something different.,2,The War Z is DayZ with better graphics. The War Z has many features that rip off from Dayz. As stated in earlier reviews it has many bugs/glitches. If you are willing to spend the extra $10 on ArmA 2 I would favor that over buying this game. Not only does ArmA 2 have mods like Day Z it has mods like Wasteland Mod. You are getting a much better value with buying ArmA 2 over The War Z.,2,this game is a lie it is a pay to play game that wouldn't even serve the people who payed with the kinds of features this game would need to pull some enjoyment out of it. Do not buy this game.

Do not buy this game. The world is huge yes but it is mostly empty uninteresting space that you will have to tediously traverse. there is one map there are supposed to be missions created by the players but i haven't seen anyone use this because the majority of your time and energy spent in this game will be spent avoiding other players because the game is balanced so that it is advantageous to spawn kill noobs as they leave the base and there are no protections for new players as they first venture out of the safe zone. this game is poorly balanced poorly designed does not include most of the features it says it will include and would be pay to win if you could win ever. Oh and did i mention that even off of hardcore mode you lose all of your items when you die and have to wait an hour to respawn. if that doesn't dissuade you then you and this game deserve each other. i promise you wouldn't enjoy it anyways.,5,This game has a TON of potential. And when you find a game without hackers and play with a friend you can have a lot of fun. However right now the Devs (through unprofessionalism) and hackers are destroying the game.

Random bans for no reason. Straight up lying about game features (all screen shots on the website are fake and do not represent the game at all). Fact is this game could be really great. But the devs need to start acting like honest professionals and not snake oil salesmen with a bad attitude. And they need to fix the biggest problems with the game namely the BS nickel and dime transactions and the hackers.,6,Great idea for a game. You take the zombie survival of the Arma II mod: DayZ and you turn it into an MMO where you can fight other players and scavenge for loot.

Many players argue that it is only in beta but the developers fail to give out enough testing. Instead they test the gameplay themselves without using feedback from the community. Great idea and concept but poor execution. I would buy this game while it's cheap because of its potential.,5,I gave a 5 because of the potential I see in the game. I play the game frequently run my own guild of 160+ members was even a moderator for the game's forums for a time and have been a supporter since the forums first opened (registered 22nd on the forums).

Community relations (or lack thereof)... I don't blame Hammerpoint as a whole because there are some good people working for that company. But there have been some major errors made by some major people in that company and it's destroying the community and Hammerpoint's reputation. Hammerpoint needs to act more professional. Insulting members of the community constantly putting out deadlines for various features that they miss showcasing features in the game like they are there but are not etc. There have definitely been times they (mostly just Sergey) have blatantly mislead or misdirected the community about a plethora of things and it destroys the trust between consumer and developer. To be perfectly blunt Sergey needs to keep his mouth shut. Stop using "english is his second language" as an excuse. He has openly insulted players thrown out multiple blatant lies and because of his horrible English makes the company look amateurish. His arrogance will be the company's downfall. Let other's like Tyler (JonnyTruant) or Patrick (Kewk) do the talking and handle the PR. Every time Sergey opens his mouth a disaster happens. The game... It was originally (and still is) showcased as a zombie apocalypse survival MMO. It's not. It's a FPS game set on a wide open map where you collect guns and other supplies in the field. There is no survival aspect to this game and zombies are not a threat (they did add more zombies recently to the game which helped but it's still not close to where it should be). Basically PvE doesn't exist it's 99% about the PvP. So for people buying this game because they think it'll be about surviving the harsh realities of a zombie apocalypse wait to buy it. It's not there yet. We still need probably double the amount of zombies we currently have we need zombie infection we need harder PvE gameplay. We need injuries hunting making fires fighting off sickness etc. MAKE IT ABOUT TRUE SURVIVAL. Right now I have 50 guns dozens of armors 100s of food/water/bandages etc... I'm not surviving I'm thriving. And this is only after 18 days of looting since the last wipe. Core features like skill trees driving cars harder PvE content SERVER RENTALS (which have gotten pushed back probably 3-4 times now) player-generated missions expanded safe zones do not exist but the website advertises it like they do. It's misleading and ruins the credibility of the company. DO NOT ADVERTISE FEATURES IN THE GAME THAT DO NOT (YET) EXIST. I still play the game because I have an amazing guild and I enjoy parts of the game but it has a very long way to go.,7,This game has great potential but has its glitches company issues etc.  If Hammer Point sorted out its need for money and took out most of the gold coin transactions it would be a great game. They also need to stop saying things will be done soon when there not and need a straight time period of a patch.,10,After the recent changes I have now changed my rating to a 10. Let's hope they keep making community changes. The reverting of the 4 hour lockout period has changed my gameplay to more positive in contrary to the previous. Now onto private servers!,8,I've had War Z (Legend Package) since the very beginning and since then I've easily put over 100-hours into it. It's by no means a finished product but despite that it's still a game that gives me and my friends a lot of satisfaction. At its best The War Z gives a real sense of tension and some adrenalin fuelled fire-fights something that after 25 years of gaming (I'm 35) I struggle toI've had War Z (Legend Package) since the very beginning and since then I've easily put over 100-hours into it.

At its best The War Z gives a real sense of tension and some adrenalin fuelled fire-fights something that after 25 years of gaming (I'm 35) I struggle to find. There is a tonne of negativity surrounding this game which for the most part is unfair. I would urge everyone to ignore all that and look for honest and unbiased appraisals of the game before deciding to buy or not. That said there is still a lot to be done to get this game to where it should be and I'm hoping the development team can ride the current storm and achieve their goals. I have to judge this game on the amount of time it's kept me playing and all I can say is that it's the best £ I've spent on a game in a long time (and I spend _a lot_ of £ on games). For me the key features that they need to be adding are all around the dynamics of the game: i.e. different types of zombies e.g. specials with different behaviour and attack patterns wild-life (for food) more reasons to team-up with other players vehicles (on the next and larger map) proximity voice chat radio chat dynamic weather more buildings and outposts to explore on the map etc. In addition there are balancing issues that need addressing such as the 'low gfx' settings that give an unfair advantage to those running them. For the record I'm a big Day Z fan and I'm looking forward to the Standalone it will be interesting to see which one I ultimately invest the most amount of time in. At the moment I'm thinking it will be War Z.,8,A much better game then its reputation. Dont belive all the scam lies about this game. Have had some of my more intense ingame moments in this game. Its a thrill.,8,I loved the game before the 12/14/2012 patch.pvp is really the only fun thing about this game. zombies are way too easy to kill and they're just annoying to deal with.pvp and looting other players corpses is a lot of fun to me.you get an adrenaline rush after player kills because others can watch you in third person mode and wait for you to run by then kill you.

Overall the game plays smoothly and fills a action/arcade/survival niche of the Zombie Game department.  It doesn't take itself as serious as DayZ does but is not a "Rail" shooter like the Left 4 Dead series is.

Every time I log in I get a new chance to comment on how I feel the game should be improved thanks to voluntary surveys.  Its not a finished game by any means but its getting a lot of things right if you can get past all the hate mongering.,8,Don't buy into all the nerd-rage it's great value at $13.50 and a heap more fun than Day Z Mod especially played with friends. Will be interesting to compare it to Day Z Standalone.,9,Game is great and a lot of fun a lot of people are complaining about stuff not being in the game but the devs are working hard on following there timeline they put on the forums. The game is still under development so just play and have fun.,8,I normally don't write reviews but after reading some of those reviews I had to put in my two cents. First notice that all those negative comments are saying "Day Z is better!"  That may be true but this is not day z and you shouldn't hate it because some game similar to it is better.  Rate games on how good it is not how good its competition is.Graphically it is not spectacular.I normally don't write reviews but after reading some of those reviews I had to put in my two cents. First notice that all those negative comments are saying "Day Z is better!"  That may be true but this is not day z and you shouldn't hate it because some game similar to it is better.  Rate games on how good it is not how good its competition is. Graphically it is not spectacular.  It looks like it should be made 5 years ago graphics wise.  Its not all bad though.  I see things and can instantly recognize them.  Graphics are not important to me much and so it is not weighted much in my over all rating Game play is fantastic.  It is a zombie survival horror game.  The game play is exactly what you expect.  You start off some some food drink medicine and a low tier weapon.   Than you proceed to scavenge for more of everything.  Save crap in your global inventory and be happy.  Yes they have an item mall but you can only buy what you can find normally you can find currency in game and its not smart to spend real money because the second you die you lose all your gear. Sound is pretty good.  I don't much care for sound in any game but this game its so so.  You do make sound when you walk on other surfaces gun shots are unmistakable (it even makes that ricochet sound when a bullet hits a rock close by you).  There isn't really any music but there is mood setting sounds occasionally.  I guess its what you expect; from a zombie survival horror. Story is non existent.  This is not bad though in fact this is good.  Its what makes this game special.  Its a sandbox type of game similar to Mount and Blade.  You forge your own path and do what you want. Over all I give this game an 8 out of 10.  it is REALLY fun and will play it a lot. (played it 10 hours nonstop on launch day).  However it can improve a lot and according to the developers.  My mid 2013 it will have a lot better about it (they list what they want to add and when they expect to do it). And on top of all of this the game is only $15.  When compared to a normal $60 game this is a great deal!  Go buy it before they do take it out of beta and jump that price up to $60.,10,i love this game i am not going to use the "its still in alpha beta excuse". but this game still has a chance of surviving and i will keep playing it. the only bad part is the hackers but hopefully they really do have a anti-cheat engine lolol  Overall its only 20-30 bucks and you get to be a part of a game that might be a hit...who knows,10,This game is great. I've played it since November 27 and while there are some miscommunications and glitches this game is overall great. It is still in development but has many great features.

I hardly ever run into hostile players and nothing of any hackers that have been reported. I've managed to get guns several times as well as rare armor and items. As an overal game I give it an 8/10 due to the fact it has some features missing and the developers are sometimes distant on information.,10,The War Z is a lot of fun. I'd give it two thumbs up. One of the best things I love about this game is the death system. In most MMO's death is simply a minor inconvenience -- you die you re-spawn at the alter with all of your gear and maybe suffer some repair costs.

No other game gets my heart pounding and my palms sweaty like The War Z. When you have a backpack full of loot and you hear the sound of footsteps from another player or gun shots nearby..... Oh man it's game on!,10,The WarZ is still developing and i think it got great potential i like the sandboxy aspect of the game atm. The biggest problem being the hackers and the really hard start for new players. Lots of things need to be fixed but im pretty sure the evolution will come quickly.,0,Needs PVE and of. Others are okay with the whole PVP thing but in the end it is unplayable because of people killing you... ALL THE TIME! The developers are con artists it's boring and is pay to win.

The developers were shady banning people who demanded for a refund blackmailing them and treating them like dirt. They made all these high and mighty claims to be in development before DayZ was but have no evidence to support this. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for creating this disgrace to the video game industry. They should apologies for this sad  state of a game but they wont because they have already gotten what they wanted some quick cash from the hard working gamers. To the people who support this game you are sadly misled you should not support these developers and defend them you call us bad or kids because we expect good fun games in this day in age. We should be rallying to remove this joke of a game from the steam store so no more have to buy this broken boring and just junk game. Infestation: Survivor Stories (aka) WarZ should be used as an example for developers as to what not to do.,0,This game is absolutely horrendous. The game is absolutely full of hackers who can purchase stolen or sold accounts for less than 2$ so they will never go away. I strongly advise anyone to stay away from this game.

While running from one area of the map to another with my friend I was suddenly instant killed by the server and banned no warning or anything. After contacting Hammerpoint they said I had been banned for hacking (the audacity!) refused to provide any specifics or proof of such a claim and informed me that my account would remain as such permanently. After much coercion from my friend to buy the game again so we could continue playing together I caved in and started all over again for the $15 price. Considering my friends all had better skills and equipment at this point I spent quite a bit of time over a few days farming zombies for the meager amount of exp you get. While clearing the airport of zombies after playing for practically all day I was suddenly instant kill and banned AGAIN! Once again Hammerpoint wanted me to re-buy the game. At this point of course it's obvious that this game is nothing more than a marketing scam and a poorly implemented one at that. Suffice to say after such a bad experience for such a piss-poor game hell will freeze over at least twice before I would spend one minute playing this sorry excuse for a game again.,0,Just do to all the stupid positive reviews...

The game is wrought with so many hackers and bugs it's a vicious cycle trying to spawn gather (server-hop if threatened) run to safe zone. What happened to no 'pay-to-win' microtransactions? Buying rare backpacks and ammo in the store certainly seems like a big help in 'winning'. I honestly can't even waste any more time on going into further details about why this game is so horrible. If I can get one person considering this game to not buy it I've done my job.

The saddest part about it all is that you pay $14.99 for a game that stresses it includes features such as strongholds anti cheat and many other non-existent features.  The steam review is intentionally vague so that they don't need to take responsibility for telling you a specific value a month ago they stressed it was "100 km of land" when in truth it's 100 km including the empty skybox.  The best part is if you look at the help they tell you it's not a Pay 4 Win game but the weapons are so rare (some don't even spawn!) that it seems it is a Pay 4 Win.  They nickle and dime you what I would expect from a pay once then play for life game is that there is no in-game real-money shop.  Though the game has good features it's the developers that I really dislike.  They give you their word then the day comes and they say "Sorry there was a delay!" then you wait and the same thing is said.   The second worst thing in this game is that they promised you some limited item for buying the alpha version but they know that hackers can just hack the random items in and then claim they're legit alpha'ers plus they promised the alpha price was cheaper than the beta or gamma price but is 25 less than 14.99?  I don't think so...  Plus they abuse the new players and ban those that criticize their game in a way that forces them to either buy the game again or quit.  My thought for all you people out there quit.  The third thing is that they make an in-game real-money shop but hmm I wonder if they put the time and effort they did into the game that they did into the store it would be even better than DayZ!   I give them credit for the base game engine and I give them a thumbs-up for the survival based gameplay but it's buggy you can jump off of a car [in which the car is incredibly off scale or you are] and take no damage but you can crawl down a small hill and take 3/5 of you're health as damage?  Plus the doorways are a bit off scale and the developers in game are jerks some even encourage hacking.  If you put this all together the game would be horrible if it got better and with a good company governing over it it would become an actual MMO and way more enjoyable for the players.  I like the game just not the creators.,0,Okay okay first of all have i ever told you about the definition of insanity. its repeating something over and over and over again expecting something to change. really guys stop the lies and using images from walking dead terms of service from League Of Legends grow some balls,0,Este juego es un fraude no da nada de lo que pide. aunque este en fase beta eso no tiene que significar que pueda tener tantos bugs. por ejemplo. hace unos dias me conecte felizmente para jugar en un servidor con pocas personas porque el juego este esta lleno hasta arriba de hackers y cuando menos personas en un server mejor. bueno pues me meti en el server y sopresa! de golpe morí y meEste juego es un fraude no da nada de lo que pide. aunque este en fase beta eso no tiene que significar que pueda tener tantos bugs. por ejemplo. hace unos dias me conecte felizmente para jugar en un servidor con pocas personas porque el juego este esta lleno hasta arriba de hackers y cuando menos personas en un server mejor. bueno pues me meti en el server y sopresa! de golpe morí y me creia que eran los hackers pero no. me mato una cosa llamada fairfight total que me desconecte y me meti con otro personaje y me tiro del juego cuando volvi a entrar poni que estaba baneado permanentemente.

Having an email telling me to change P/W their  ass launcher wouldn't let me in the game to do it or do it via the launcher as it was out dated but wouldn't update because they shut everything down due to being hacked  for weeks I couldn't do it on the site and the whole thing was a joke. The game is riddle with hackers the players are for the most part childish and idiotic and there isn't a single good thing to say about this abomination for a game. Graphics  2 (outdated rubbish and bland)sound  1 (repetitive cheesy and stupid)gameplay  0 (non-existent run around for ages to get 1 shot by a camping sniper gun play is like a 15 year old FPS)longevity  0 (I tried for a week to like it but after 5 minutes I felt ripped off)Developers  MINUS 10 (The worst possible developers of all time. They treat the game like a joke the customers like a joke and I'm sure what they are doing is borderline illegal) There's a reason this game scores so low.

Seriously look it up this travesty bans based on stats rather than detections. No I am not kidding. There is a reason BF3 admins stopped using that failure of an "anti cheat"The game just looks terrible too. At first glance it's not too bad but then you look at the textures at a reasonable distance and you want to puke. I actually saw 2D props in this game. Yes 2D props.The animations are terrible I've seen better ones in player made mods from older games.Loot is bad and nowhere to be found zombies glitch out and teleport to you thanks to the game's NUMEROUS glitches. Speaking of zombies if you were looking to play this because the zombies are slower and according to logic more realistic because of it than DayZ don't even bother. There are SPRINTING zombies in this game and the last patch made it so that now there is even more.There are hackers everywhere. Almost every single survivor I came across had some kind of ESP or aimbot.To top it all off this monstrous pile of excrement has the audacity to be PAY TO WIN. There is a marketplace and even though you can not buy guns you can buy ammo which is VERY VERY hard to find normally as well as attachments which can NOT be found in-game and armor which also can NOT be found in-game.Support is terrible I would even say non-existent. Good luck if you have any issues you are better off asking the players. Here is my experience playing the game:Day 1: look around get a feel for the game and look for stuff to pick up. Not much is found but scant supplies but at this point I thought it was just bad luck or a bad zone. Died about 3 times to zombies because I was still learning and once to a player who seemed to know where I was at all times.Day 2: I have looked online for spawn locations for zombies and items and tactics. I die twice to players after finding 3 guns all pistols. One might have been legitimate but the other was clearly aimbotting.Day 3: I make a route of the best possible paths to get "good" loot. After coming and going out of these very dangerous areas I have come across 4 pistols and finally one assault rifle. I did not die that day because I was going into VERY low pop servers. Also found good backpacks.Day 4: Continuing my loot route I keep to my low pop servers tactic. This proved to be for naught as I get killed by a player over 300 meters away with an assault rifle in 2 shots. The "max range" for assault rifles is 85 meters. After losing all this stuff I continue to try and loot finding two assault rifles and a few pistols after a long time of looting the same "high quality areas" and server hopping often.Day 5: Looting continues I die halfway through. I had accidentally pulled a lot of zombies but managed to outrun them putting at least 20 meters between me and the one leading the pack with a sliver of health left but it glitches and teleports to me and kills me instantly. Infuriated I continue to try and play until I get killed by yet another player despite having nothing on me. At this point I ragequit for the day.Day 6: Looting again.. this time I actually find a sniper rifle for the first time in an item box. Feeling good I now try and remain on the higher ground whenever I am out looting so as to spot and snipe players before they get close. Plan did not work out was killed by a player aimbotting with an assault rifle once again.Day 7: No players no glitches decent loot. Or at least what can be called "decent" in this game with such crappy loot. Everything's fine. I am walking towards the city when I see chat light up with bans. No big deal I've seen this before but it is annoying to see on the chatbar. I comment in global saying that it's annoying to see that every day and all of a sudden my character dies. I rage and figured I had been killed by a sniper or something as I was sure no player or zombie was near me at all. I try to log back in the game and guess what? Account permanently banned. Excuse me? I am permanently banned? Yet I have come across all these hackers?? Did I mention this was AFTER purchasing GC?! Apparently something I did triggered fairfight (FAILFIGHT)'s statistics system and got me banned. Maybe I headshot too many zombies and it thought I was aimbotting because of it who knows. Either that or an admin saw me commenting about how annoying the ban messages were on the chat and thought I too should have a taste. This is literally the worst game I have ever played in my entire life and I doubt I will ever play something worse ever again. Everything that can be wrong about a game infestation has it.All the badmouthing this game has received is in reality ten times worse than that.

ANYONE who purchased the game and not activating their serial key or log in for around 2 months are considered as inactive and are banned for no reason. Many people filed support and complaints and the lucky ones would get their account re-activated AFTER 2 months of "investigation". The game developers are shady and unprofessional. They even delete forum posts regarding this matter (as well as many others) just to hide the problems.,0,Worst game ever  The developers want to pull the money out of the pockets of the players.THE GAME IS NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18!HIGH ADDICTION FACTOR  ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE!Do not play it  Sometime you regret having spent money for the game .Here's a few things that come to mind spontaneously:- It flies regularly out of the game  "Punkbuster" kicks eitherWorst game ever  The developers want to pull the money out of the pockets of the players.THE GAME IS NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18!HIGH ADDICTION FACTOR  ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE!Do not play it  Sometime you regret having spent money for the game . Here's a few things that come to mind spontaneously: - It flies regularly out of the game  "Punkbuster" kicks either match or you get errors. If you fly out of the game you will still be some time ingame  Anyone can kill you in this period  zombies or players  .- Graphics bugs can be found anywhere  Missing or incorrect textures. Flying objects or sunk in the ground.- At many specific points you just get lag. Lags when Chem lights or burning torches lying around .- Lag and bugs with zombies. Zombies hit from a distance. Zombies stuck in objects. Zombies teleport around.- Wait for 10 seconds until you can leave the game  mostly you wait even longer. In time  you can not cancel or defend themselves. For me waiting times were up to 1 minute are not uncommon.- Many hackers in the game with Aimbot  ESP Wallhack & Flyhack  Let's tell you anything. There are also hackers veterans server.- Lately there are fewer and fewer servers and fewer players .- GC was prohibited .- You can only buy in-game dollars with GC. Prices in-game store  dollars) were extremely elevated so that the customers need to buy more GC.- New maps have been promised for months and repeatedly postponed .Without private servers you can hardly play quietly  On many players spawn camping with sniper rifles  You can not trust anyone  Private servers are very expensive  about 50 dollars) for 1 month.- Premium Accounts (1650 GC) are not very good. While you get more than twice as much experience but the loot is not only more but better. Quantity rather than quality. But Premiumserver are Public. There are no premium private server. Therefore the risk of dying during looting much higher. You get 900 GC back but only if one logs on once a day. Time is important.- The screenshots in Steam does not always correspond to the truth. A few zombies characters and weapons do not exist in the game.- Little customization of the characters. Some characters do not even have 2 look.- Game content are promised (eg cars) and are now canceled.- Many players were banned for no reason. The manufacturer was no answer. Players had to wait for months until they were able to play again. Some wait longer or forever.- PvE  Here you'll find no PvE  only PvP Look around  there are still dozens of other problems and complaints.,0,just doing my part as a responsible gamer to help further lower the score on this game and show the horribleness of the developers.

It's over priced for such a bad game. It is also a rip off of DayZ the awesome mod for Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead.  Worst game of 2012. One more thing to mention: IT WAS MADE BY THE CREATORS OF BIG RIGS OVER THE ROAD RACING which is a bad thing because the game is the worst game I have ever played in my entire life along with Extreme Paintbrawl.,0,Don't buy this game!

Broke game can't swim extolling money for pay to win items hackers galore banning people regardless of what they were doing and generally horrible business practices...  Stay away from this game and company at all costs.,0,the war z is nothing but an impudently scam. lying about production and releasing a totally bugged and unfinished game which does NOT contain the promised features. they charge money to rent your own server and what? you can not even control your own server! if you want items or weapons on YOUR OWN server you have to PAY for them  on your own server. that is so unbelievable impudent!,0,Do not buy this game cheap copy of Day Z  made to make money. They lied to sell more copies of the game and they are ignoring all criticism by blocking/banning people from the game forums steam community and more. Textures are horrible assets are taken directly from War Inc. and zombie AI is brainless. There are also a lot of hackers in game.,0,The second game in my 25 years of gaming that i ever got a refund on.  Most the positive reviews look fake.  Avoid this like the plague the guy who made it has 3 of the top 10 worst games ever made he lied to everyone and when called out on it he blamed us saying we didnt understand him right we are stupid and uneducated.Let this just be a lesson to developers.,0,I'm just having to write this review because I noticed that out the first 5 people I saw that gave this game a 10..for all 5 of them this was their only review.  I've been following the saga of this game in the gaming news and the whole thing just sounded like such a jaw dropping scam I had to register for myself to counterbalance at least one of those fradulent 10's.

I've been following the saga of this game in the gaming news and the whole thing just sounded like such a jaw dropping scam I had to register for myself to counterbalance at least one of those fradulent 10's.  Selling in game items for real money that can then be taken from you by a hacker or spawn camper? Let alone that this game is a blatant ripoff of Day-Z by a terrible developer...yeah...that's all I needed to stay a mile away from this game and it's greedy publishers.  Keep in mind also that Steam initially pulled this game over making claims about its game that weren't even true.  Buyer beware.,0,Not only is the game a disaster but the company behind it is shady as well. I was lucky and got refund before they started reply to refunds with "asdasd". The name is genius. Makes people think it's standalone DayZ. It is not. It's a shame of a game.,0,Its a non-free game with micro transactions. If it was free i might play it a while (ty steam refund) but it is still a buggy mess with cheats and hacks.,0,Worst game ever which now got hacked to its bones.Enjoy getting your user data being sold across the web. If that doesnt bother you you can always login to get aimbotted to death while enjoying the lack of feature this game has. Truly another marvel of the gaming industry!,0,the game is unplayable there are a loot of cheats and hacks....bad grafics  idiot zombies  the worst game played in my live its a game from a 1$ price and its expensive for 1$!!!dont buy  its a nightmare!,0,Warning: I’m Spanish so don’t expect to see a British in this critic.Well I try lend this game a  5 because if you like it you like it (there isn’t any book of likes and dislikes) but I lend it a ZERO it’s not simply a  of game is a fraud. Why? Well let’s start whit the critic.1: The EULA was a EXACT copy of the league of legends EULA at the bottom of it you could read “WhenWarning: I’m Spanish so don’t expect to see a British in this critic.Well I try lend this game a  5 because if you like it you like it (there isn’t any book of likes and dislikes) but I lend it a ZERO it’s not simply a  of game is a fraud. Why? Well let’s start whit the critic. 1: The EULA was a EXACT copy of the league of legends EULA at the bottom of it you could read “When press accept you agree whit riot and league of legends terms and conditions” (is not exactly but was something like that) but obviously casual gamers or the 99% don’t read the terms and conditions (I’m include but I usually read the updates changes on games and in some parch at the bottom appeared a “change of the Eula” I fell curiosity and I search in internet and TADA! i found the why of the EULA change)2: The false publicity. On steam you see the game as a finished game whit good graphics pictures “in game” and videos whit excellent animations. You get on the game and the textures sucks a lot the modeling is a crap and the animations aren’t realistic or what we seen on the videos. Graphics aren’t the most important of the games but when you lie to your public is important. And the person as says “is a ALPHA a BETA a unfinished game!”  well steam buyers thought that the game was ended whit updates but ENDED. In the page appears as a ended game so another lie. (And minecraft was on alpha and beta a lot of time but it was a good game anyways Natural selection is not ended is in alpha and is good 2 so is not a excuse)3: Stupid work really it gots 300 bugs and they aren’t trying solve them they still there and they will stay. “but is a indie game made whit a small group of persons” NVM! They should fix that! Is affecting the gameplay so hard and the why they don’t fix them because it’s a game that take them 3 hours of script 1 hour of texturing they buy 4 servers and dead end. They aren’t going fix it and they will add 3 things more so the ppl can keep saying that the game isn’t finished.4: The idea is a copy of another game that can be discussed but if you say no explain me the copy of the title! They took that 2! They didn’t do anything new ho srry the micro-buys but that’s only a pay-to-win strategy and a way to take more money. Take ideas is not bad but do the same as other did it is.5: Gameplay lies yes more lies. Hardcore appears as a ended option. But you go in the game and is a feature as is not ended so is so hard add that on steam? Is so easy: “To end: Hardcore”  and another big one: MMO war z is a MMO. Massive multiplayer online? Really? A game whit 50 persons is not massive. Call of duty 64 slots BTF 64 slots (or close) natural 24 slots.  These games aren’t MMO and a game whit 50 is not a MMO and whats the point of that? A group of ppl that love say “I play MMO´s” buying it? I prefer a zombie survival where you fell really alone disesperated where you MUST work in teams for survive the massive enemies (think this: a city whit 3000 ppl on it 10 survive 2990 are zombies that’s the idea you are a a lucky person as why X reason is not a zombie)6: Gameplay. The survival ends after you got this trick: the IA sucks. You go to the city run to the zombies and then run away the zombies stay whit no reason afther 30 meters and they stand there and BOLIA! Free way to loot but be careful! The really survival as you got is the following one: Don’t crush an invisible wall or the dangerous camper player will shoot you whit a sniper and dead end.  Really the PVP is more difficult that the PVE (player vs environment) that happens sometimes in DAYZ (im not a fanboy but I have to compare it for the following reason  but in the stand alone they will try solve it whit the gun deterioration so the camper after X time will need go loot another sniper and that’s a solution. Hammer is not lending any solution to itSo the conclusion is the following one: you like it because you like it good for you but is a fraud. The company want a shower of money selling a product copied of another company and then wash their hands saying: “The game is not ended”. Don’t buy it but if you aren’t a anxiety person and you can wait wait for DAY Z STAND ALONE it will be a good game a awesome. Whit updates and whit less bugs or not bugs because is not a mod is a single game whit they own scripting. But if you want play a multiplayer zombie survival online NOW I recommend the DAY Z mod. But when the stand alone comes out the mod will stop updating I think.,0,The worst games i have ever played... don´t spend your money with this  the controls are horribles the engine is horrible the graphics.... and if you are rich or  a hacker it´s your game if you not you,0,Absolute garbage.  I bought this to tide me over until DayZ standalone and boy do I regret it; I should have done my homework on these developers.  This game is an obvious cash grab.  The developers are full of s!@#.

The community for it is awful and consists almost entirely of griefers. There is no use buying this game because it will just ask for more and more and more if you want to actually play it. This may appeal to those with no sense of accomplishment and a swollen bank account.,0,Worst waste of cash I've ever done hackers everywhere (more than a 40% of players using them) unplayable game it's more a shooter than a survival game.

FAIL they really need to just get sued and games banned from all Sales outlets.,0,This game is for a lack of better words AWFUL. To even call it a "video game" would be an insult to the entire gaming community. I have never seen a game riddled with so many game breaking bugs. It is essentially unplayable.

That's it i'm done with the game. This  ain't even worth for free. DON'Y BUY IT!,0,I purchased this game for $40 when it was still in Alpha i was hopeful it would be a successor to the DayZ Mod for ARMA II which is fantastic. But this game is so terrible i'd rather burn $40 than buy this game again. It may sound harsh but this is possibly no defiantly the worst game on the planet. It only has ONE good thing and that is it is a comfortable and easy uninstall.,0,This is everything that is wrong with gaming.  I don't wish any sort of personal vengeance against the creators but some efforts deserve to fail and this is one of them.  One of the sloppiest things I've ever seen.,0,The game has many bugs the anti cheat system before the arrival of PunkBuster was in my opinion useless and did not solve anything. Was banned by the game just because I played a lot. Would not recommend.,0,Pay cash or get hooked up with a friend. Absolute only 2 ways to have a fair foot in the game. Something they should do is let you start with any kind of weapon or make sneaking around zombies less time consuming especially with the 1 hour death timer.

It's just the same thing with a different name. At this point it's easy to ask if the devs are even trying to make this game happen. It all comes off as a big "buy now regret later" scam where they slop together some quick face to sell the product then ignore anything that only matters after the purchases are made. Kinda like how Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing was made actually. Not surprising that after a decade of being a laughingstock these developers haven't even changed their most basic tactics for game development.,0,This game is so bad I can not even fathom how others can give it a rating over 3/10.

And now everyday I wish Steam would give me a refund because this game is-just-a-piece of God damn...It's just so bad it should get an award of worst game of the century. I honestly believe this won't be exaggerating. I understand this game is still Beta but the quality of this game present is nowhere able to justify how  it is. All in all a bit of exaggerating opinion to help you decide whether or not to get this game or not.A) Burn down a hospital full of pregnant women and new born babies.B) Buy this game. The answer is you should really chose A instead of B. That's just how bad this is.,0,So maybe I've left this review a little late.

That is when the game used to be fun where you couldn't purchase ammunition and the Devs. hadn't rolled in their greedy campaign for the users money. It's one thing to charge people to play your game and then to further charge them through an ingame store because let's be honest the items in the store do not take '20 minutes or so to find in game' because a flashlight Jedi would have emerged from the darkness and struck you down before that. It's a game full of broken promises we were promised drivable vehicles and those who bought in early were falsely led on the pretense that they were to be given their own Stronghold server.. (We're STILL waiting for them). All in all a shoddy attempt to cash in on a popular MOD (Which hasn't taken any money thus far) by changing the character models of their other poor Online-Shooter War Zone Inc.,0,I've never been shocked and appalled with a game purchase before but after my new experience you can count on 'Infestation' to change that.

I was shocked so when I emailed back saying they've lost a customer and I would give 'DeadZ' a try they threatened they would contact steam and tell them to ban my account as 'they caught me cheating' (basically lying).

The developers openly lied on the Steam store. In addition they felt it necessary to have in-game purchases even though the game is already a rip-off. This is the only game on Steam that Valve has ever openly handed out refunds for. Think about that.,0,I bought this game for $3.49. I should have just bought a cheap cigar and put it out in my eye. This game is bad as they say. There is little even for a big zombie enthusiast to enjoy here. the levels are really big with nothing between camp sites but glitchy forests not even wayward zombies. The game is geared towards making you spend real money on gear. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL!,1,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.

In Game Transactions: The biggest mistake War Z makes is the in game store. I found to my dismay that purchasing a weapon and dying from a glitch several minutes later does not mean that when I respawn I'll have that weapon back. Bad move and a bad idea... In all The War Z is a blatant bad game with wasted potential. If some changes were made I could consider a higher rating. But War Z is in it's current state a shadow of what it could have been.,1,Be warned The screenshots on their website are mostly prerenders.You are better off looking up youtube player footage to see what it really is like.Shame that it was so bad it could have been something nice. Multiplayer is fun with friends a lot of these maybe and green reviews are from people mistaking the enjoyment of doing that as a good game.,1,To put it lightly this game is atrocious.

Low-res textures sluggish gameplay not to mention the fact that zombies are near invincible. Another mistake Hammerpoint have made are the in-game micro-transactions I'm talking about the marketplace where you can purchase ammunition forTo put it lightly this game is atrocious. There for those of you with a short attention span there it is. Honestly what didn't go wrong with the game? Low-res textures sluggish gameplay not to mention the fact that zombies are near invincible. Another mistake Hammerpoint have made are the in-game micro-transactions I'm talking about the marketplace where you can purchase ammunition for guns... this is a SURVIVAL horror game why include this option? Steam also failed to notice that this game was only in its beta stages when they released it (I believe this has since been pushed forward to the full game or alpha) I made a definite mistake of purchasing this garbage game. I and many others think that this game is only a cheap rip of the hugely successful Arma 2 mod DayZ which I recommend you play. I'm not here to rant about this game as many people still enjoy the game but in all honesty most people are only playing this game because they want to get their moneys worth. If you have not bought this game... Don't. Simple as. This game is not worth the price on Steam and it was never checked as FALSE ADVERTISING was also used in the selling of this game. I'm mainly advising you not to buy this game but that's not to say I haven't had my fair share of enjoyable moments (even if they were short-lived). All in all this game is a cheap and terrible rip of a hugely successful game and I would advise anyone who is thinking about buying it to not buy it. I went down the War Z road and it's not a very scenic route.,1,It is a shame they allowed this game back on to Steam...let it die already. I could drone on about its numerous flaws or how I'm currently using the BBB to get my money back from them. Good idea for a game hopefully someone else does it right. I will never do business with these people again.,0,By far one of the biggest farces in videogaming history.

The combat is terrible And frankly this game is essentialy the biggest scam ever made to exploit people who actualy like zombie survivals. Did I mention the combat is simply awful?,1,In short the game was rushed in development and it shows. I saw all the bad reviews and thought i would decide for myself so thought i was prepared for the worst turns out i wasnt. The point of this game was to be an accessable version of DayZ but it isnt all that accessable once you are playing you start with no weapon and in a world of the bloof thirsty zombies and equaly bloodIn short the game was rushed in development and it shows.

The point of this game was to be an accessable version of DayZ but it isnt all that accessable once you are playing you start with no weapon and in a world of the bloof thirsty zombies and equaly blood thirsty players this pretty much screws you over from the start and stops you gaining an intrest in the game. this would be forgivable if the game were mmore sick than its modded counterpart but it isnt. The idea behind the game is good and hope it lives on but this game is not good and should never have been released as it is. DONT BUY IT IT JUST ENCORAGES THEM TO MAKE MORE BAD GAMES,0,I purchased this game back before it was released based on the screenshots and what the developers promised to the community. Unfortunately none of the things that were promised to us were ever implemented.

The graphics on the game appear to be out of date the sound effects  are comical and the zombies have that super spidey-sense that allows them to know where you are coming from a mile away. Even after all those downfalls I still tried to play the game and I found a group of people who were actually fun to play with.  Then I decided to buy another copy over steam for my brother.  Within two hours of playing it he was banned from the game and no one can tell him why. So because of the horrible customer support that my brother received and the all around bad game play I had enough and quit playing.  Now I'm out trying to save everyone the hassle of wasting their money and being abused by the developers only in the game to make more money and never help the community.,0,Haters will hate but games will scam aswell.. if they didnt want the bad remarks they shouldnt have lied and said shyt that was totaly untrue just to gain money and player base. but hey people will waste money on crap things and thats why game companys still do this stuff cause they CAN and people will pay for it and there cash shop items in a survival game anyways so yeah.. have fun withHaters will hate but games will scam aswell.. if they didnt want the bad remarks they shouldnt have lied and said shyt that was totaly untrue just to gain money and player base. but hey people will waste money on crap things and thats why game companys still do this stuff cause they CAN and people will pay for it and there cash shop items in a survival game anyways so yeah.. have fun with this game thats not worth the review people are making.,1,Thought this game was going to be interesting but the insult here is the amount of lawsuits and stolen engine pieces they have. THey tried to get by with minimal amount of paying for things and used only 10% of the engines full power... let alone even use the updated version of the engine from version 1.2 to 10.02.34. It's Insulting that they did that.  and stole ideas from another game.,0,This game is probably one of the worst multiplayer games I ever tried ever. It has very little redeeming factors to even consider recommending this to anyone. First the gameplay is very subpar the developers seemed very lazy when making it glitches and hackers run wild and the zombies are surprisingly more brain dead then a can of sardines. The promises the devs make never get fulfilledThis game is probably one of the worst multiplayer games I ever tried ever. It has very little redeeming factors to even consider recommending this to anyone. First the gameplay is very subpar the developers seemed very lazy when making it glitches and hackers run wild and the zombies are surprisingly more brain dead then a can of sardines. The promises the devs make never get fulfilled or stretch the little they actually do to make it look like they did something. and  It's a game that's trying to cash in on the WarZ hype and it has had so many complaints it's a wonder that people are still playing and paying. There is a cash shop in the game and you need to pay real money after buying the game to get ahead of the game easily...so much for the survival aspect if you can just pay through it. The service was terrible I was banned about 8 hours in because of "hacking" which is a flat out WTH moment since I wasn't customer support was less than helpful and said if I wanted to play again I would have to buy it again.  Everything screams shady when there is a metascore this low because this game is just one thing. It's a money grab! Save it for something with a better reputation and a development team that really cares for the players.,1,This game is a joke. Not only is it plagued with bugs and glitcheshackers and cheaters Micro-transactions on a game payed for.But whats worst is that this game promised so much that it never delivered to teh point it's been removed from steam and re-namedIts horrid,0,This is the worst Game I ever bought and played.It's not worth ANY MONEY AT ALL.Many BugsNearly no promised features found its way into the Gameeven after a one year period.Worst Game and worst Publisher i ever encountered.,0,this game had potential... but then they  on it with bad game play glitches and lies in the trailers... this game is by no stretch of the imagination worth it avoid this game at all costs,3,i bought this on Steam thinking this looked like a good game and it was pretty fun    at least for the first few minutes. You can go in lots more buildings (unlike DayZ) and you can jump over things easier as well as climb on cars (which actually works to prevent death by zombie) and that is about all of the positives.

You can go in lots more buildings (unlike DayZ) and you can jump over things easier as well as climb on cars (which actually works to prevent death by zombie) and that is about all of the positives. The graphics are pretty bad you can get hurt from even the smallest fall spawn campers and glitchers are too common there is no quest system or clan system you have to wait a long time to respawn from death and you lose all of your stuff so there is no reason why you should not just make a new character and get all new stuff too and purchasing stuff at the store by doing things in game takes ridiculously long(unless you use lots of real money) plus when you die you lose all the stuff you just bought with real money. It had potential to be a good game but it still feels unpolished and should be considered either a very terrible final product or still in Alpha stage. It is a shame that Steam decides to treat it as a finished product when it should be call Alpha still. If you want to play a open world zombie survival game then go play the DayZ mod for Arma 2 or wait for State of Decay to come out.,0,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        This game is terribleI have NEVER seen such bad balance in a game. Brutal player killing bugs missing features and expensive micropayments are the true drawbacks of the impending zombie apocalypse.,0,Did they really think changing the name from The War Z to Infestation: Survivor Stories is going to trick gamers into buying it? Another disgusting display from the developers here.,0,I played this game with an open mind expecting Day Z with better visuals animations etc and with less bugs.

The in game mini transaction system take all the challenge out of an already payed for game and leave players who are unwilling to spend there hard earned cash on ammo and hats at a disadvantage. I can only declare this game to be absolute garbage and it fully deserved it's appalling meta-score. To top it all off the devs decided that it would be an excellent idea to change the name and temporarily remove it from steam adding yet another reason as to why you should ignore this game developer until they pull there hypothetical head out of there arse.,1,This game falls short on everything and did not say on Steam about it changing it's name on the store page which tells a false advertisement which they did when they first came out and they denied to refund me for their false advertisements. I am angered at myself and this is honestly the only game I gave a bad review or a score of 1!

The game is full of bugs horrid visuals decent audio terrible animations and very very slow game play. You will have to sneak most of your time even if a zombie is 200 feet away from you and he will spot you which will lead to other zombies chasing you if you try to run so either way you are going to die. The game makes it where you can only spawn 5 characters and you have to wait an hour for the character you played as dies to play him again.For a sub titles that are way better than this and you still want to get your zombie fix I highly recommend this game as I highly enjoyed it.Arma 2 Combined Operations  DayZ mod (DayZ is a free mod and the same concept of this game I am reviewing and I would rate that mod a 8 out of 10),3,Infestation: Survivor Stories is a terrible game on paper.

So some weeks later they announced a new patch that they now gave us a chance to turn off shadows. We thought we could play again. But we were disappointed again.The only settings before were High/Ultra they only changed the labels not the real effect.

I started playing this game in it's Beta stage and it had a lot of bugs then but once the game was released it was an entirely different game and I mean for the worse. First off the game had nothing to stop cheaters from using aimbot esp and all of that stuff so you primarily only played in games with a couple of people or empty so you could at least enjoy the game without being killed by a cheater. This only got worse over time and I quit about the time they implemented that fairplay because the developer kept on with lies. The servers were supposed to be priced reasonable or at least that's what he said something around $20 a month but when they actually allowed you to rent servers it was $60+ a month and even more for a password protected server. So what people started doing is renting slots out and you paid them with the in-game stuff or the currency that you could shop with(I don't remember what it's called). That was the only way to actually play a decent game without having to worry about cheaters. Then what killed the game the most is the developer kept messing with the loot spawns zombie spawns and all of that and it just got tiring. You would of honestly never expected the game to be such crap after looking so promising. I wouldn't give this game to somebody for free. If you want a zombie game play Day Z or wait for H1Z1(though it keeps getting pushed back).,0,I have been waiting to give a review since I naively paid for this so called game when it came out.

It places you in an unattractive glitchy world full of terrible zombie animations ugly textures and unused space. The game runs awful and their coders have no clue what they’re doing. They are constantly changing the game in bad ways. Loot has never been stable. It’s either out of control and you’re being flooded with finding chemlights at every spawn or you’re finding nothing. Hammerpoint is constantly finding ways to get their players to spend money. You can buy items in the marketplace buy your own private server to avoid dying against players and buy premium which allows you to only have a hope at finding something of better value at a spawn point. The lead guy behind the title released a forum post saying that if people didn’t buy from the marketplace the game would eventually have to go offline. They even included a hotkey that opens the shop in-game for you to buy items and have them instantly (which has now been removed with the latest patch). If you’re looking for a “survival” game this isn’t it. Infestation: Survivor Sandwiches (Kappa) is nothing but a money grab and is ran by a shady company that has no interest in making a quality title but instead snagging as much money as they can while they kill off the game. I feel like I’m being generous with this again but my score is definitely changing. Please if you’re looking for a survival game avoid this piece of trash at all costs.,6,Do not purchase this game.its very bad full of hackersbugs and disconnect problemsbad supportJust look at the İnfestation forums to see the problems,3,AWFUL GAME.

The price of the game is alright and micro transactions are somewhat understandable but the content is not as of yet is not near "Fun" as "Boring" is.It still holds promise but for now it's to most peoples Index in the  Section. I hope they prove me and the gaming community wrong. Bottom line $15-16 bucks is OK for a chance/gamble of this bouncing back.,1,The worst survival zombie game ever made.Bugs and hacks everywhere.

In my little mind I think that in a zombie game people should band together to store food secure boundaries and just live. If you were try and do that you'd make that in a safe zone which people can just camp at and get easy kills. The game is flat out broken. It has several features that aren't even in the game yet the microtransactions in it piss me the hell off (even though there can be vendors and such in a town so it's not completely terrible) and the game is just missing so so much.

I also had hopes for the features it promised such as the skill tree and the Stronghold server hosting we where promised with the pioneer and Legendary packages. If not just the Legendary which my friend bought. We haven't gotten any of these features yet. It has been to long waiting and I have given up. There is nothing positive I can say for this game anymore. I used to stand up for it but with the disappointment I have attained throughout the patches. This game in my honest opinion was and I mean every word of it a giant pile of donkey Sh1t.  I wanted to punch my screen every time I got D/C'd from a server for no reason. Also the amount of hackers in this game made me want to cry. There was no playing legit. So i just stopped and I do NOT regret it. This game is terrible and i want my money back. TL;DR: This game sucked barb-wired Dild0s  And I mean that.#Barb-WiredDild0Guy #YOROSHWAG #DoNotBuyOrYourPeePeeWillBeSore #DizzNegga,1,This game had so much potential but is no more than a cash cow.

I've never written a review or bothered with anything like this beforeDo not buy this game! EVER! Yup as you can probably already tell I was unfortunately one of the many poor bastards that jumped on the Steam $3.74 sale bandwagon! Oh wow what a shame. This is by far the most absolutely horrible pathetic lamest crappiest and a few more blankety blank blanks game I have ever played. I've never written a review or bothered with anything like this before but this game has motivated me to do so now. This game is purely pay to maybe win and free to lose and die suffer regret and rage to the extreme. I'll lay out some math for you... They start you out with a flashlight a granola bar and a bottle of water. If you stand there without moving your thirst and hunger degenerate which is fine but it's to the extent that you have to eat and drink something roughly every 10  15 minutes. Huh that's lame. Now you have to find food and water by going into zombie infested areas which isn't too horrible you have to survive that's understandable. But then the map is really small and there's usually about 20  30 players minimum in any server at any time so good luck getting the good stuff as a noob with a flashlight going against hordes of zombies and other dudes with guns and not to mention you have about 30 minutes to do so otherwise you starve to death or die of thirst. But! You can buy food and water in the store! =O Holy crap hallelujah! (Can't believe I spelled that right the first time.) Downside  A bottle of water costs $400 in game cash or a certain amount of gold coin things that you can only get with real money where 5 USD gets you 615 or so. So $400 in game cash for a bottle of water. How hard could that be to get with only a flashlight and 30 minutes to spare? Well according to the Wiki zombies have a 1:10 chance of dropping cash. They only ever really drop about 30-50 bucks in cash each time. So if you're lucky you can afford a single bottle of water in about 30 zombie kills...maybe. And no flashlights don't kill zombies very fast if you're wondering. Now on top of this the voice chat a good idea except people who pay out their asses for this game are as pathetic as what they sound total BLANK-holes that shoot first skip the questions and hump your dead face. Horrible gaming community involved with this game the customer support has never gotten anything but terrible reviews they are obviously only using this game to make money ripping their customers off at any chance they get and don't forget that they can ban you for crashing if they decide to or ban you for no reason at all instead of actually having a passion for game design and providing something at least partially half way decent to play. The graphics suck the game play is worthless and the price is beyond insane. If there are any good reviews ANYWHERE about this game they are most likely being paid by whatever hammer industry that devised this scam to rip people off. You can only play the game at first by playing a male so if you're a girl and want to play as a female you have to get $150000 in game cash to buy the character or spend about $5 to get a character. Every item that you use real life currency to purchase goes BYE BYE if you die nothing is retained after you die. And you have to wait an hour before you can play again on that character. If there's any more crap about this game that I'm missing I'm sure there's plenty of it left out there eventually you'll walk right into the fan spraying all the BLANK enjoy if you give this game a chance I'd strongly suggest seeing the 20/100 metacritic score and avoid this catastrophe. This concludes my review I am a proud survivor of this ridiculous infestation for three and a half hours and now most currently a beyond proud and relieved uninstaller of Infestation Survivor Stories with way more BLANKS then any game should allow. I feel sorry for anyone who gives this game a chance it's not worth it and they only want your money without giving anything in return.,0,Worthless trash. I'm not even going to list the issues the blaringly large % of negative reviews here on Metacritic is already a solid warning that you should not buy this game.

Some games just rip off others and the results is often mediocre at best but War Z beats records in terms of lazy game development. If trolling had its equivalent in the game industry this game would be a fine example. Stay away from this sorry excuse for a quick cash grab.,4,Full of cheaters.

At least the map is pretty close to finished not the TERRAIN just the map SCREEN. about the only thing in the game unfortunately that looks ANY BIT different than it did months ago. The devs were initially biting off of the shooter genre then decided to totally be original and bite off the dayz mod. no one else had done that yet and there were tons of crappy shooters to compete with but only 1 dayz until they decided to rip it off and make a paid + microtransaction-based product worse than a free mod. there should be a medal for that.

Not to mention all the screenshots and gameplay that come from the developer are complete fabrications.

Zombie AI is basically non-existent (they just zerg you attack you from miles away and get attracted even while using stealth  loot is nearly impossible to find as a new player you can't swim (???????? WHAT) sneaking feels very slow and buggy. The overall animations are really poor. Texture quality is on par with some very low-budget F2P games. The game isn't F2P yet they have the guts of implementing a micro transaction shop which BTW sells ammo food and other valuable items IN A SURVIVAL GAME!  Also if you decide to spend money on stuff like the hats don't you lose them once you die LOL. Horrible horrible game.

The features are all crappy rip-offs of features DayZ has and the Dev's wishlist is the same. The screenshots featured in advertisements are LIES. they feature actions that are literally impossible in the game. The clan feature is only available in the in-game store usually a free feature in MMO's. The advertise dozens of skills yet the actual number is ZERO! The playerbase is also 60% hackers but so far most of those banned are innocent due too the poorly implemented "bait" pick-ups they use to catch hackers. The servers also crach inexplicably on a regular basis. The zombies AI is the worst I have ever seen and i've seen some pretty bad AI. if you dont believe me check the steam forums for every positive comment their are dozens calling for a free refund.

This guy on you tube explains how disgusting the makers of The War Z are. It explains the lies slurs and false promises of the game and the developers. I have concluded with this video and my own experiance of the game that the only good things about this game are the promises that have been made and pushed back. The video does not discuss cars and vehicles in perticular but I must say that the promise made about them may take even 5 months to fufill. The developers of the game promised cars by the end of the year in a minor interview. The year's end has come and past but still no cars. Unlike the other promises it has not even been said when cars will be introduced as far as I know. There was a list released of things to be seen in the upcoming 3 months and cars was not on it.

I didn't think so. The WarZ is a game released quite awhile ago by Hammerpoint and it was an utter disaster. It was ridiculously buggy upon release not to mention it released at a $15 dollar pricepoint. However along with the release cost for an utterly broken game Hammerpoint had the audacity to add a micro-transaction store into the game. This store sells hats of sorts which is fine but when there is a store selling ammunition and weapons in a survival game that is in my opinion the pinochle of  That is by definition buying power. The user community I can't really blame on Hammerpoint but I can blame on the users. Now I know how often this word is thrown around but I would go so far to say as most of the community is populated by either hackers or  fanboys who won't dare to let you criticize their precious WarZ because clearly because they bought it it has to be a good game right? Wrong! The stealth system upon launch used to sneak by zombies was utterly broken and the drops were overly rare to a point where getting anything done was nearly impossible unless you wanted to invest more money into this pile of  for a weapon and a sufficient amount of ammunition. I'm trying really hard to think of something positive to say about the WarZ hmmmmm... nope can't think of anything. If you want my advice don't buy this game don't have any involvement with this game and if you do buy it and if someones asks you "Hey have you played The WarZ" just say no for your own good. Also for the record before I finish typing you can say "Well DayZ isn't much better." You're right DayZ isn't much better but DayZ is a free mod. Thanks to anyone who read down this far I appreciate you taking the time to read a relatively long user-made review. Buh bye!,0,Game is a scam.  Give the option to "report" players.  People get reported every time they kill someone.  Friend got banned because he was good and too many people reported him.  Don't purchase just a scam.  They probably banned him because he only put $15 and got too many reports.  If he kept putting money in he probably wouldn't have been banned.,0,Bought the game played with my friends for a while stopped playing for 2 months then got perma-banned. 1 month waiting and still no response from the support. Devs don't care about giving a good service they just want you to buy more copies of the game.,0,Such a terrible game and one that is just a scam for the people involved.  The creators are not nice and ban people from their forums and game on a whim.  Stay away from this game.,0,Jesus christ this game is an utter train wreck the devs cannot do anything to win me over.

Spoiler Alert! This game is **** You will not enjoy this game unless you are prepared to fork out additional money purchasing hacks or exploits which run rampant within the community. The game is a complete rip from their other game War Inc. which mind you isn't hidden at all they've came out and said that it's just retexturing etc. To summarise the game it was hastily made to capitalise on the hype that DayZ had created.,0,Bought this game after playing DayZ via the official website ( which hasn't been updated since October).

My biggest regret is not purchasing it on steam because no refunds are available from the official site. The forums are heavily moderated to the point that any any negative posts about the game get deleted and the head developer in an interview with GameSpy showed no remorse for the blatant lying on the game's steam description. Many features that where promised months ago have not been implemented such as having friends a skill tree and rent-able servers. There is only one playable map unlike the many the steam description advertised. Besides that the website claims that the map has an area of around 100 square kilometres meanwhile its actual size is around 10 square kilometres here's proof: http://www.pcgamesn.com/article/how-big-war-zs-map. The game itself costs around 15 dollars but you can purchase in game currency to buy melee weapons and supplies which I find very shady. There are also many many in game issues ranging from invisible walls far from the edges of the map shoddy textures the most hideous trees I have ever seen and taking fall damage while walking down a gentle slope. The game version is now 1.1.0 so it is not in alpha any more so that cannot be used as an excuse. Perhaps in the future this game will improve but for now stick with DayZ or wait for the DayZ standalone game that is rumoured to be coming out in this year,1,The game started out with having loads of potential and HEAPS of room for improvement.

There were missing features bugs glitches hackers and more. Over time these have been ever so slightly addressed by Hammerpoint and to this day are not fixed. There are STILL missing features that were originally promised people are still able to glitch themselves onto roofs bugs are everywhere and there are more hackers around than in any other game I have previously seen. And to add onto all this the recent release of private servers has led to an uproar on the forums leading to a great MANY bans simply for people just voicing their opinion and criticising the game (many respected and well known people have been banned). Last but not least the game itself has unofficially not made it passed the Alpha stage but officially it is a fully released game that is "always developing". It saddens me to think that a company that has achieved all this by lying and stealing has affected the gaming world and many. including myself hope that other companies do not follow suite and do the same. All of this for a little money..,0,False advertising and a terrible rip off of DayZ. It's horribly made and the game devs tell more lies than truth. It's disgusting how little effort they put into changing this game from War Inc into Warz. 0/10 would not play again.,0,This game sucks  It is utter rubbish and quite frankly valve should be ashamed of letting it on steam.

Absolute disgrace...,0,Buyer beware.  The fact that this game was removed from Steam should be all you need to know that it is a scam.  Their current scheme is perma-banning honest users in order to have them repurchase the game.  Anyone with insider knowledge knows this game will not exist 6 months from now.

I gave it time to progress because it was Alpha and I really enjoyed the concept. After forgetting about the game for the better part of a month I returned to find a more polished yet still absolutely broken game. The hacking was rampant. I made four characters (because once you die you must wait an hour to play that character again) and I spawned in with each one of them who was summarily headshotted within 20 seconds of spawning. The devs do little to acknowledge how broken the game is while pushing pay to win options down your throat without adding much substance. Not to mention that your pay-to-win items are completely lost when you die which in my case was within 5 minutes of spawning. Stay away from this game as it seems like it is a cash grabbing scam. I suggest everyone go take a read of this thread on reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/152tbh/warz_patch_unleash_the_true_moneywhoring/ Do not buy. Buyer beware.

Every time they come out with a patch they fix one thing and break about 10 other things. Don't tell me this game will get better or its beta or alpha or whatever they case maybe.

I have wasted time energy and money on this piece of garbage and I feel completely ripped off. The worst part? I still hope the game will improve and I know that in the end I myself and others who hope for the same will eventually be let down. Again.,0,The War Z is possibly the most fraudulent game made in the last decade. From faked screenshots to advertising features on Steam (before it was removed) that do not exist in game the title is one big lie after another.

From faked screenshots to advertising features on Steam (before it was removed) that do not exist in game the title is one big lie after another. The game play itself consists of attempting to survive in a zombie infested world (again a much smaller world than advertised). However the real danger in the world of War Z is the absolute failure of design as far as anti-cheat. Numerous cheats are available for sale and many many people are using them. The legitimate player is much more likely to die from a script kiddie using an ESP hack or aimbot. This has been a problem from the first day that the game opened as the game is simply a mod for a game called War Inc. The cheaters simply modified their scripts from that game as it is the very same game except with badly done zombies. As this is a PVP game and you lose all of your items upon death this is a major issue which the developers don't seem to be able to fix. There are numerous other issues as well covered in many other reviews. Suffice it say buying this game at this time is a pure waste of money.,0,Total failure. This game is not successful copy of DayZ. The worst spent money. I completely don't recommend.

Now they've released the game to the public under the assumption "it's complete!" and I can't support this game at all. The underlying factors of bad business practice ethics the very potent censoring that goes on in their forums and the Steam discussion board is all very disturbing. I'm afraid to know what will happen in the future from this company and therefore cannot recommend it to friends nor give it a good rating. People are claiming this game is in Beta it's NOT. This is still very much an alpha or even pre-alpha game. They're nowhere near final-release (which is the definition of Beta) and have been blatantly lying to their customers. Do not buy this game.,0,Calling this 'thing' a game is an insult to every video game ever made. If you put a gun to my head I would still not buy this game. Please whatever you do stay far far away from this game.,0,Do not purchase this game. Many features listed on Steam are completely missing.

In order to kill zombies you need to buy gold to buy in global server...but as soon as you land in server some guy is waiting for you to gun you down....then you have to wait 1hr (now 4hr unless you pay)  steam took it off buyability list and offers refunds now,0,Hammerpoint's WarZ with their bait-n-switch tactics false advertising and decreasingly excellent credibility has become the online gaming version of the TSA: brainless zombies grabbing at your junk for no apparent reason who then try to charge you for the privilege of being so continually violated.,0,Bought the game awhile ago and it showed prospects still does but and its a big BUT the developers seem keen to merely milk those supporting the game for all their worth.FINE the Steam write up was a mistake maybe.

BUT then don't charge for re-spawns the day after without at least first fixing the hacker problem mainly because of the logical reason that lots of people are joining a game at the moment 'surviving' for ten minutes and then are quickly killed by a clear and obvious hacker. The message this gives may not be intentional but its effectively Pay 2 Buy our Game Play our Game Get Killed By Cheats Pay More That last part could be rinse and repeat obviously dependent on the dedication of the player. Oh and then effectively censoring what you want us to say about your game...low and just increases everyone suspicion levels to Defcon 4. I get it though its in Beta or Alpha it takes time to fix the bugs it takes time to improve the game But (theirs that word again) don't charge us an arm and a leg while your doing it. If and when this game was improved open basically FIXED I would have happily nown and again paid to respawn if I was enjoying it. Does it sound like I'm enjoying it at the moment. The only two conclusions I can make looking at the overall picture are SCAM  or DEV Financial issue fix (opinion) . I hope its neither and just bad decision making in which case fix it.,0,Horrible game. Plagued with bugs glitches lag no tutorial of any kind graphics and textures suck even on ultra.

In reality this game is none of these. Zombies are a bare-bones path finding AI simple proximity based. Nothing smart about them and certainly not in hordes.

If more than one is chasing you its likely at least two will look the same since they only made about five different zombie skins. Also they chase in straight lines so instead of a roaming wall of zeds coming for you. Its a line a cute line of zombies. Moving on. Huge world. The site claims the map is 100+ Sq Km. It is in fact roughly 72. Adventure! No. There is no adventure just endless running. No items to be found just endless running. No places to hold out from zeds just endless running. Running running running running. In fact this game should be called "Running Simulator 2013" except for the fact that your only lightly jogging most of the time and sprinting is limited to about 200 in-game meters. Finally there is the plethora of lies from the developers about the features on the steam page and their website. If you look at today's (12/19/12) PC gamer stories you can see the developers blaming the gamers for this. Bad game.Bad developers.Bad bad bad. DO NOT BUY!,0,I created an account just to give this game a negative review. The developer's shameless begging for people to upvote this game was enough to bring me here to express my opinion. An awful clone of a game that already exists with ridiculous bans on users outright lies in advertising and a backhanded apology by the company. Truly disgusting game and company overall.,0,For all good and peaceful on this planet stay away from this game.

I honestly cannot believe that in this day and age a business can go through with all that. One would assume that the consumer base has grown as a collective group but it seems that only if the part of the group that is awake and not blinded by corporate misleading causes an uproar things may change.,0,This is a terrible game its so bad its not even funny its like big rigs with zombies and campers trying to kill you and bugs trying to kill you  hills also try to kill you and you cant even sprint properly or swim.,0,I bought this game on 18-12-2012.

I spent $20 on this game off their website and now it is on steam I implore you not to get this game! This game as a whole feels like a Duke Nukem where it has been in apparent development for a few years yet as it seems from playing it two days ago and I have hated every minute of this.  The whole sound system with walking (It sounds like you character is wearing concrete shoes!) a graphic quality where even playing at ultra which i currently am looks like in some places the texture of a Xbox / Ps2 console generation and a combat system where smacking a player can kill them in two hits with a torch yet if you do it to a Zombie you could be there for hours!! This game apparently is beyond alpha and is ready for steam (which it has been removed) which is pathetic and steam made a huge mistake there by promoting it! Another thing which i want to bring up is the revival system (when you die you have to wait to revive your character to use it again) which at first is a clever thing in my own opinion however the notion of paying money to revive a dead character with real life money and then forcing you to agree to a T&C; (terms and conditions) that removes your right for refunds and you cannot argue back is pretty much illegal and that side of it is pathetic and i personally cannot condone! Also with this the notion of using your own money to buy items where when you die you loose it is stupid and in no way shape or point worth it. The things that are promised are not there the game has had incredible bad reputation and quite honestly i can understand from their previous exploits of banning people who are requesting refunds etc of high ranking online banking systems etc. Quite honestly this i a rip off and i feel cheated out of my money and other zombie survival games such as Dayz which is an alpha mod which is free and a game named state of decay which is also an sandbox zombie survival style game (in the same style as dead island) where you can play over multiplayer but doesn't have the pathetic in game money scam. Watch reviews people playing it already video's before even going to click the buy button as this game is not worth it!,0,The War Z is a very feature lacking mod that is developing so slowly the developers kids may have to take over once they retire.  The entire Hammerpoint Interactive company has tried to capitalize on the success of the wildly popular DayZ mod and has failed miserably.  Hammerpoint is a bunch of money mongering douchebags and you should not buy their ****,0,Never seen a game so corrupt in its creation.

Guns were few and very far between constant PKing despite having no gear at all and random zombie agro (through a wall? I think not hammerstone) This feature should not even be on a paid-for market.. the game is simply that bad. Texture glitches zombies that get agro from 50 meters away and losing all of your items (even items you BOUGHT with real money through the GC trade) are Gone! That was probably the worst thing about this game. I paid an extra $20 for some Gold Coins in game which I could buy a hammer or some backpacks or med packs ALL of which were lost when I died.

I've seen SEVERAL people just walking up walls jumping super high and killing me when they are absolutely no where around me. When it is dark you might as well stop playing all together  and log on later because you can't see ANYTHING. The only way you can see is with a flash light which you are no longer given after you have died so many times. Also the absolute worst thing about the game is the revive timer. It is ONLY there for the devs to make more money. Total waste of money!,0,I have played a lot of terrible games in my life but none so horrible as this. Can't believe I wasted fifteen bucks on this.

People get banned from the game by complaining. For example the biggest city in the game have around 4 buildings that you can enter out of the 50 that are there the rest is just prop. I think there are 8-10 seperate buildings in the entire game copypasted all over the place to make cities. They keep utdating mundane things like the "map" not the map you run around on but the map you pull up to see where you are that keeps getting updated. From what i gather they just confessed that they dont have a antihacker program but instead they put items in places where only hackers could get to them and banned them that way.

While still a huge map the size is just under 10% of the 100km which were promised. Weapons: You cannot punch push trip or doPurchased the game through Steam. The game is simple enough delivers on some interesting points of play but in the end it's a shallow game with little staying power outside of griefing other players. Map: Colorado - less than 10% of the promised size. While still a huge map the size is just under 10% of the 100km which were promised. Weapons: You cannot punch push trip or do anything to protect yourself from zombies unless you have a weapon. The weapons are exceeding sparse in game and cost a good chunk of ingame money or a micro transaction worth roughly a dollar for a bat (which can be lost immediately if you die). Item Despawn: If you die and have another character available to get your items chances are within 2-5 minutes your items will despawn. This was tested using 2 account - PvP deaths result in a despawn of items within 3 minutes in most cases and PvE deaths are roughly the same (averaged out) the lowest despawn time on items was observed to be 0:43 seconds and the longest was 3:20 seconds. Respawning a Character: The game has fluxtuated between how to get your character alive again. From a 1 hour time before you can use the character again (meaning your items will be lost from either looters or despawning). The game has also put into place but removed a 4 hour respawn timer with the option for a micro transaction to revive your character early (costing 50credits) nearly $0.50 to revive each time. It's been observed that spawn areas are not safe and often you can pay real money to revive and be killed while still loading into the game. The early revive option was removed for undisclosed reason. Microtransactions: As explained above the cost of items through microtransactions is substantial. From nearly $2.50 worth of credits for 10 rounds of ammo to around a Dollar for a wooden bat. Since on death you lose all items this means other players can kill and loot all your real money purchased items (and they often do). The game mechanics - As stated combat options are limited guns are nearly impossible to obtain ammo is even more rare and a simple blunt weapon (bat or hammer) can take an hour or so to find. Since these items are in high population areas populated by NPC zombies and players; chances are you'll die attempting to get anything useful and be looted of what little you had thus reinforcing the need to use real money to get any sort of advantage. Combat Damage: PveE - Sometimes a zombie will hit you for nearly no health other times one swipe will take our more than 50% of your hp the damage is unreasonable at best and does not make for a uniform experience. Falling from a few feet sometimes will be fatal (from a box top) or do not damage (falling from a fence). This makes judging any kind of fall distance impossible as the results are completely unpredictable.PvP - Get shot once and you're certain to die or get hit once with a hammer you might die or it could take 15 hits to kill you. All have been observed. Headshots are not reliable - having tested - some headshots will kill and sometimes 2 or 3 will not kill a target (PvP and PvE included). Running is the only defense player have from Zombies and some zombies are still buggy and will chase you indefinitely. Players have a gauge which limits the duration they can run and zombies do not and naturally run faster than humans so save your run gauge for when it's really needed. Safe-zones: Sure you cannot be shot here but plenty of jerks are around camping the outskirts of the safe zones waiting to get players coming or going; these safezones are the only place you can be if you want to add  microtransaction items to your inventory so you can purchase and item enter game try to leave get killed and immediately lose your item you spent real money on. MMO: This game is nothing more than a larg(er) scale deathmatch map as seen in Call of Duty or any other FPS. The game worlds are not persistent they are stagnant and do not feel 'living' nor 'undead'. NPC respawn moments after killing them there's no randomness to what spawns where you know where the items will spawn in each location (only what item will spawn is random and done on a loot table with a % chance for each type of item weapons obviously lowest chance). This is NOT a hardcore/hardmode MMO it's a FPS claiming to be more than it is capable of being. Sound: The distance/volume of zombie sound effects is bugged and the sound of footsteps is often bugged sounding like metal while on grass. Opinion: Don't bother with this game. If you want a 'hardcore' experience in a TRUE MMO check out a game such as Darkfall Online (about to relaunch in Jan 2013) or a game such as Eve. As this game is no more than an FPS there are simply better FPS options out there including the Arma II Mod Day Z which this game has copied. In the end "The War Z" has/had huge potential.

As a DayZ player I have known my share of random teleporting zombies crazy bandits tricked out with sniper rifles and really retarded controls. But hey DayZ is a mod it is free and it freely admits to being in Alpha. WarZ on the other hand CHARGES you money to run around with the same bugs and more.

But hey DayZ is a mod it is free and it freely admits to being in Alpha. WarZ on the other hand CHARGES you money to run around with the same bugs and more. For example I never knew how dangerous it could be to walk down a freaking hill until I died doing so in WarZ. It still wouldn't be as bad if the devs didn't advertise for features that weren't there. In fact the only real feature that works in WarZ is the microtransactions. Seriously they should only exist in a Free-to-Play game not a paid for game. The graphics in this game is also just as bad with copy/paste trees and crappy melee attacks out of 2001. In conclusion WarZ is an example of how badly a studio can screw up an exact copy of another game. 0/10,0,This comment will be long but please bare with me so I decided to take a look through the positive comments for valid points to TRY and balance out my review from how I feel about the game and it just pushed me more and more to the negative side the main trouble it the fact you cant take 99% of the reviews serious for example some reviews only state negative things about the game andThis comment will be long but please bare with me so I decided to take a look through the positive comments for valid points to TRY and balance out my review from how I feel about the game and it just pushed me more and more to the negative side the main trouble it the fact you cant take 99% of the reviews serious for example some reviews only state negative things about the game and yet still give it 10/10?? others in their review say the game is 8/10 but scored it 10/10??….well these people are deluded to the point its scary Zombie_Expert stating that the fact WarZ is only getting "hate" is because it came out after Dayz if this was the case then MOH Halo COD (first games in the series) should have terrible reviews because they came out after Goldeneye Doom Quake right?....wrong they got good reviews because they were good excellent in fact so this argument is flawed. Hypnoso states "Not all the features are available yet but devs are releasing up to 3 patches a week" now to me that clearly states you have to buy a empty game if the devs are having to put out 3 updates a week this clearly shows the game shouldn't be at a state where you can purchase it. TreePunchers "the best game I've played all year. I have no idea how this masterpiece has a 1.1 average. WTF are you people playing" how ANYONE can class WarZ better then "Journey"  "The Walking Dead"  "XCOM: Enemy Unknown" just to name a few is mind-blowing. There are also two comments I found insulting but not because they used harsh or offensive language but because it came across so much so that my first reaction was "well they must have surely been paid off to say this" or they are just a genuine internet troll hopefully the latter look for reviews by "LucasSM15"  "Scouser" for a true mindf**k. BETA  Alpha are words banded around to defend it but even the dev has stated its not in BETA Alpha or even full release to me this means its just a lost game with no direction that its been quickly patched together to make a quick buck off of the back of Dayz and why does it comes across that way? well because its true. DayZ fans boys are another statement used constantly to defend WarZ its this problem that the fact most of the positive reviewers cant be taken seriously because they mostly dodge the real issues about the game but just blindly say “well it’s in BETA  Alpha it’s the DayZ fan boys its haters its this its that not many of them seem to be able to face the truth because funnily enough there is a reason why this game has this score and why its getting these sort or reviews. Anyway if you want to know more about why WarZ is being called a scam reasons why it gets terrible reviews go on Reddit type in WarZ and read the post called “WarZ Evidence  True Moneywhoring”,0,This game is the worst game about zombies it's a trash.Someone tryed to copy DayZ P.S.

The collision detection is completely jacked up where if you walk on rocks it makes loud metal noises and if you walk on metal it makes water splash noises. I'm convinced that the developers are either complete noobs or complete scammers. Either way nobody you want to support or buy a game from. There is absolutely no story or point to the game and it has one horrible map that you can cover in a couple of hours. Oh yeah and lovely spawn camping you can barely make it 100 ft from a safe zone without being killed and when you do chances are you won't have any weapons because the spawn campers looted you from your last death. 1 more thing. 1 hour respawn time.

The Steam page on which I brought promised many things that simply were not there multiple large maps (only one small one) finding it was only in Alpha  Beta (Not mentioned when I brought it) Private serversI was very disappointed with this game when I found I had purchased a buggy mess that became the first game I have ever asked for a refund on that was not "Officially broken". The Steam page on which I brought promised many things that simply were not there multiple large maps (only one small one) finding it was only in Alpha  Beta (Not mentioned when I brought it) Private servers (Nowhere to be found) skills (What skills? where are they?) and the list goes on but I would be here to long. The reason I gave this game a 3 out of 10 though was because out of the 6 hours I painfully had in this game with broken AI and some of the worst textures I have ever seen I did find it slightly more satisfying when I found a few friendly people in the game and went around with them in search of a gun which I never saw after 6 hours... But those two people were the only two people outside of hackers and people who just shoot you for the sake of being you as already mentioned the zombie AI is a joke they run all around you rarely hitting you run and get stuck on anything that's not flat or use their mighty zombie powers to kill you from many miles away. And I thought I'd mention the textures again because it will take some beating to find a game with worse sometimes you might think your going along a road nope in fact you've been stumbling up a hill that looks like a road because of this giant pix elated mess that sits before you. And let's not forget the classic fall a few centimeters equals death part of the game if this is what a real zombie apocalypse would be like thank goodness it doesn't exist. To put this game into a nut shell if you like a good old broken mess this game is right up your street if you want a zombie survival game just get Day Z whether that means waiting for it's standalone release or it's Arma II mod it's a much better experience and the source most likely for this game trying to cash into it's success. Staying away from this game is a wise phrase most people use for this game I agree with them at least until this game gets some severe updates and by that time Day Z standalone should be out. I may have given this a 3 out of 10 but that was scraping the barrel.,0,This game is simply bad from every angle;- Terrible texturing/rendering- Constant glitches which should have been worked out in beta- Prices of pre-ordered accounts are in some cases 4 times as much as release cost- Server sizes are well below the promised size Map size is well below promised size- People pre-ordered for private servers which are still not activated- The skillThis game is simply bad from every angle;- Terrible texturing/rendering- Constant glitches which should have been worked out in beta- Prices of pre-ordered accounts are in some cases 4 times as much as release cost- Server sizes are well below the promised size Map size is well below promised size- People pre-ordered for private servers which are still not activated- The skill trees aren't up yet and should have been up during beta- Spawn points are clustered even though there is plenty of space to randomize it more- Falling damage and combat damage effects are erratic and unrefined- They blatantly stole artwork and pictures from The Walking Dead- Hammerpoint simply copy-pasted a lot of the game elements from previously released titles yet there are still tons of bugs as if they had built them from the ground up- Original game overview and developer commentary swore up and down that there would be NO SAFE ZONES yet it took less than 2 weeks for them to cave in on that one- Items purchased with real money are still lost upon deathetc...I pre-ordered because I had a lot of faith in what promised to be a great game.

The difficulty of it is finding the redeeming factors now. Hence I have given up on it. I tried so hard to like it but it is impossible. It is certainly not helped when you are lied to again and again and again by the developers. All in all: Avoid this at all costs.

You have to pay RL cash for some of the basic items like revival and ammunition. The graphics are about the quality you would expect from an average sixth gen console game the controls are atrociously bulky and unresponsive textures and sprites will often fail to load entirely.I honestly feel like the score of 1 is a little too generous. Claims were made in the description that are simply false. This game feel pre-alpha but is being touted as a ready-for-release "foundation" version. I will be actively avoid anything from Hammerpoint Interactive in the future. They attempted to capitalized on unwitting fools (like myself) who figured they could stand to lose $15. I'd have rather dropped a $20 bill in the street than to have actually paid for this game.I'm appalled for the sake of all those who are passionate players in the gaming industry I feel sorrow for those who still feel like video games can be an art form. The War Z is a big spit in the face to all those inspired individuals. I feel sad for all those eager gamers who looked forward to adventure and fun and got bored at the best of times and felt alienated and betrayed at the worst.

Don't listen to the fanboys they're blinded by stupidity.,1,Well i will rate this game on the content and not the surrounding criticism due to the misrepresentation of this game on War Z store page ( also steam) the lack of acknowledging wrong doing by the devs and so on.. I was looking forward to War Z although i did have my worries of this being a simple cash grab that was trying to jump on Day Z's coat tail of success/popularity and well DayWell i will rate this game on the content and not the surrounding criticism due to the misrepresentation of this game on War Z store page ( also steam) the lack of acknowledging wrong doing by the devs and so on.. I was looking forward to War Z although i did have my worries of this being a simple cash grab that was trying to jump on Day Z's coat tail of success/popularity and well Day Z and War z being almost identical by name could give one some fear of what i just mentioned and my fears were and are confirmed. This is nothing more than a cash grab trying to exploit off another games viral success and i say this because the game is inherently broken controls very clunky and although the game is being sold it is missing key features which are advertised.The visuals are poor a simple walk (not jump) over a ridge can deplete all health hitmarkers are very hit or miss and suspect to say the least poor effort in the sound dept (although they just added some new bgm but i left before this had happened) poor pc support w/ almost no dif between low and high settings depth of field is very poor wheter is draw distance or just trying to look from door to next room ( have you looked @ a doorframe lately? looks like one with the house/building) maps have not exceeded 100km as of yet although promised up to 400km servers are laggy as hell but this can be fixed night time gameplay = spray paint your led/lcd screen black ( i mean come on !! has hammerhead ever been outside at night?) Day Z zombies make War Z zombies look and feel very generic and lack luster and this isnt saying much ( no offense Day Z) The water is outright ugly and pathetic spawning needs help boring enviorment which is very ugly to look at to begin with plenty of bugs in game which effect gameplay and the list goes on.. I dont care if this was 5 bucks if a game is bad its bad even if it were free so please stop saying "its just a 15 dollar game".. Save your money  do not buy and the fact that the devs lie take no responsability and use banning on forums as an answer to anything which isnt a glory to high heavens this game is awesome type of comment is appauling = tread lightly on forums or you will be banned/blacklisted... I wasted my money for you guys so you dont have to suffer this let down.,0,Already asked my refund.

In it's early stage of development it has achieved much much more than what WarZ has. There are assuredly many other pros and cons of each of these games but this is not the place for them. If you purchase this game I hope you do not regret your decision.,0,This game is just a quick cash grab riding on the Day Z mod's success.  I urge anyone that bought this game to request a refund.

Oh right yeah... Firstly the developers produce screenshots that aren't even remotely correct (vehicles/working guns and vaccines e.t.c)...Then they lie about half of their features: huge maps? There's one map and let's face it it's not very big. But we all know about those and I can't be bothered to go through any more. They took our money and put it to bad use. C'monWhere can I start?

There's one map and let's face it it's not very big. But we all know about those and I can't be bothered to go through any more. They took our money and put it to bad use. C'mon devs. Now onto the game. Yeah it's fun sometimes but only when you get into a gunfight with a non-hacking enemy which is my first complaint. Too many hackers. They don't even have anything close to an anti-hack system. They rely on screenshots and other reports. Then they don't even do anything. Secondly it's full of bugs. Too many bugs then they have the right mind to call the game not alpha or beta but "foundation release". Bugs: walking down a mountain and losing 90% of your health jumping through a window and getting flung through the ceiling onto the roof grass not rendering at far distances on lower graphics settings therefore giving people with slower computers a better advantage. Also all the random crashes most commonly when you kill an enemy with lots of loot it all drops at once causing a lag spike and even crashes. Another thing is the zombies way too overpowered for beginners there needs to be some kind of tutorial to basically tell them how to survive. As a beginner you are sat there pounding 30 hits into a zombie with a baseball bat until they die. But if you're getting chased by a whole town of zombies then this isn't very good because you will almost certainly die. Finally the Sergey said the game won't be pay to win but some websites are offering a version with an AKM B92 a backpack and 21000 GC (ingame cash). Won't be long before there's guns in the shop. I think the game has potential but right now it's full of bugs lying developers and constantly broken servers.,0,The game is rubbish. all it is trying to do is making use of the popularity of dayz and trying to earn money from people. the game is also not ready for release yet it was. go look at the T&C; and its from LoL they didnt even remove the link,0,ATTENTION: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME The developers are straight out lying and the game is NOT finished AT ALL. This is nothing but a quick cash grab. If you have bought this game get you money back as soon as possible,0,A cheap cash grab that's all.

The developers clearly 'forgot' to mention this fact on the Steam store page. Thousands of people have purchased it expecting a finished game yet they have received an absolute **** fest. Let's get down to myWords cannot simply describe how bad this game is but I'll do my best.

Thousands of people have purchased it expecting a finished game yet they have received an absolute **** fest. Let's get down to my initial experience. As a regular DayZ player I least have some knowledge of how to play this sort of game. During my first life I went to a trailer park and found two unarmed players. I got to talking to them and we agreed to team. Within about 5 seconds of me turning my back they began to hit me with their flashlights (note: I stated to them that I had nothing of worth as did they). I tried to run away but thanks to the game's ****ty stamina system I died. 5 minutes into my second life I ran into a building in a small town looking for loot and was immediately killed by someone wielding a knife. No hesitation no time to react dead. 5 minutes into my third life the same pretty much happened but it was at a different location on the map and they killed me with a gun this time. (note: I had nothing I was barely even a threat I didn't even go close to them before they shot/stabbed me down). Barely 3 minutes into my fourth (and final) life I was shot by sniper completely out of the blue for no reason. After that I decided that I'd had enough. It's basically Call of Duty with overpowered zombies thrown in. They kill you in about 5 hits and when you're stamina runs out (which it does fairly quickly) they run faster than you. It's bad enough that they had to copy DayZ but they've done such a bad job of it. If you're thinking about buying this game I strongly recommend that you don't. Wait for the DayZ standalone. TL;DR: CoD with Zombies. Awful game.,0,This game is a fraud. Not a single claimed feature is true the game is buggy and boring.Some Textures are worse than sprites from DooM and the gameplay feels almost non-existant.,0,I paid 50 bucks for this (Legendary) and honestly would have rather spent my money on a blowjob from a  cheap hooker named Martha with no teeth. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.,0,I believe that the choices made by the dev of WarZ are terrible and should receive a score of 0.

Reviews with the developers are shady and developers actions within the community are shady in general.,0,As an avid fan of zombie games and survival horror I specifically signed up to metacritic to warn everyone about the atrocity and utter abomination of a game this is. Graphics: 0/10 running on very high textures terrain and models looks like they belong in Half life the original released in 1998...14 years ago.....Gameplay: 1/10 Stealth does not function properly  zombie AIAs an avid fan of zombie games and survival horror I specifically signed up to metacritic to warn everyone about the atrocity and utter abomination of a game this is. Graphics: 0/10 running on very high textures terrain and models looks like they belong in Half life the original released in 1998...14 years ago..... Gameplay: 1/10 Stealth does not function properly  zombie AI in this game behave like walls and objects do not exist and will detect you no matter where you are zombies kill you in 4 hits(intentional as you will have to pay more money to play hence why its so brutal) when you die there is a 4 hour respawn timer which means if you die with all 5 characters you will essentially have to pay more money to revive your character if you want to continue playing. No in game voice chat only text object spawn in places you cannot get to hats occupy 99% of the item spawns. Sound: 0/10 A random collection of noises that seem to drive you insane after the first 5 minutes. Bugs: there are so many bugs and glitches invisible players invisible weapons sliding down a meter down a hill takes away half your health glitches through buildings teleport glitches invisble walls broken animations texture bugs  the list goes on Microtransactions: once you buy an item and you die you loose it for good BE WARNED. False advertising ! On the steam page it advertises for multiple maps up to 400square kms skill points private servers up to 100 player servers. The game currently has ONE map with 100kms NO skill point mechanic Servers with max of only 50 people NO private servers available. STAY as far away from this game as possible this has the be one of the most disgusting piece of work i have ever played,0,Purchased this game on steam when it came out as I'm always interested in zombie survival games boy was I in for a surprise. First of all none of the features mentioned on the steam store page were in this game at the time of launch:-No 100 player servers -No 100-400km2 worlds/maps (there was only 1 70km2 map with plenty of invisible walls)-No Private serversNo SkillsNoPurchased this game on steam when it came out as I'm always interested in zombie survival games boy was I in for a surprise. First of all none of the features mentioned on the steam store page were in this game at the time of launch:-No 100 player servers -No 100-400km2 worlds/maps (there was only 1 70km2 map with plenty of invisible walls)-No Private serversNo SkillsNo Hardcore mode. And now onto the bad parts: -No swimming not even shallow riverbeds enjoy walking around for 20 minuts just to cross a small creek-Zombies are constantly bugging out-Slow ass movement speed (you run out of breath in about 10-15 sec sprint and zombies move almost as fast as you do)-Horrible (worse than bethesda) animations and I mean total ass unlike anything I've ever seen before-Vomit inducing FOV-Terrible textures and assets ported directly from their pay2win shooter War Inc-Hitboxes which suck ass-Bad performance on a decent PC (i5 2500k @ 4ghz and a 560 TI) while still looking like ****-PAY TO RESPAWN (this is not a joke you have to pay to respawn or you have to wait 4 hours) If this hasn't dissuaded you from buying the game then I don't know what will.,1,It's utter crap. Now they chaged revive time from one hours to four hours and if you don't want to wait you need to pay real money to revive your character. It became pay to play from pay to win game. It's just scam and wants your money.,0,I played this game since ALPHA as I am a huge Zombie Fan. I bought the $40 pack in an effort to support development and the company. From day 1 the game was unplayable as advertised. There is NO zombie game component the game is 100% PVP. You are never killed by zombies there are simply slow moving easy to bash with any weapon distractions. The game has no hack protection built in.I played this game since ALPHA as I am a huge Zombie Fan.

You are never killed by zombies there are simply slow moving easy to bash with any weapon distractions. The game has no hack protection built in. Youtube has dozens of examples of free hacks videos of hacks ect. Let me be clear the game is unplayable without hacks .. I am killed within 10 mins of logging into the game EVERYTIME and I never see the person. Everytime you die you have to wait 1 full hour before you can play that character again. Everything you were carrying is lost and you start over with NOTHING. Having NOTHING means you can not kill a zombie (hands sare not weapons) so you are forced to crawl around trying to hide from zombies in some weird stealth game throwback .. unfortunately hackers see you from anywhere on the map and simply run over to kill you. Now that they have reduced the servers and packed 70 players (reduced to 50) on a server I am spawn killed all the time. I honestly can not play the game. Finally the company simply lies about the game features They say the maps are 100-400 km .. unfortunately there is only 1 map that is about 75km but there are only 7-8 small areas that have spawnable items .. the rest of the world is wide open and since you starve in less than a day you are forced (weaponless) into the small number of 10-25 building towns.  Even worse each town only has 2-3 areas where good items spawn .. those are camped by hackers or just clan groups of "bandits" who kill everyone on sight. This game is dead on arrival do not buy it .. do not support this criminal company.,0,Bought this game a few months ago after all of the hype. Probably the worst $25 I have ever spent on any game in my entire lifetime. The developers say "This game isn't pay to win!"

Who the **** adds in a store where you can buy **** to a ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GAME. The whole ****ing point is to survive off the land and find stuff around the map. Not to mention the terrible optimization of the game accompanied with absolutely **** graphics that looks like my dog has just eaten something green and then shat it our onto the computer screen. The developers are full of lies and there isn't ONE thing that is remotely true on their webpage or steam page. Personally I do not even know why Valve added this game to steam or why the developers are still updating the game or why the fanboys can't just get the **** over the fact that they WASTED their $25-50 and stop defending the **** stain that lies on my computer screen. Please. PLEASE! Do not even bother thinking about buying this game but if you do don't bother asking for a refund because they will just blacklist you. OK I have said enough.,0,Scary thing is I almost bought this piece of crap!

This game only deserves a '1'.,0,An appalling attempt at a game with extremely Bad customer service. Never seen such a blatant rip off of another game. In all honesty the DayZ mod is a more fulfilling game than the WarZ as well. After seeing previous games the developer has been involved in im not surprised this ended up in such a poor state. Please don't waste your money on this poor excuse for a game or support it in any way.,0,Terrible gameplay bad controls boring gameworld tons of bugs tons of cheaters.

The developers have lied and promoted themselves with false advertising. Another thing that you must consider when thinking about buying this game is that it is 15$ and you can NOT get a refund if you have bought this game which is ILLEGAL! It is also to be considered that they say it is a complete project which is totally WRONG. In fact this game is broken as hell so many glitches and hackers they even added a payment shop where you have to pay REAL money to buy items and by no means ordinary items. For an Example you could buy ammo melee weapons medical supply's and even some OP gear. Which is all completely what kind of f***ing survival game!?! They even had the balls to name there game WARZ which is very similar to the mod DAYZ which came out first and was practically the same concept. The developers are also some of the worst kind of people you will ever meet or hear about they are some big douche bags who have had some cases of BANNING random players  for no absolute reason at all! They even say that there the first zombie survival game which is complete BS. With all the info i have presented you with I would you to think twice about buying this miserable pile of crap.,0,Before playing I had a lot of excitation about how the game could be really really good. It had a lot of promises and looked like some kind of zombie survival-RPG. Well now I'm going to compare only one aspect with DayZ : DayZ is a mod. So it's free. If you don't like it you only say : "Well I wasted some time it's nothing !".

If you don't like it you only say : "Well I wasted some time it's nothing !". With WarZ you just waste a lot of money and throw it away !And guess what ? You have options to get more stuff by taking a more expensive version of the game. I'm glad I only played it on a friend's computer who bought it... I saved up some money. To resume : just buy ArmA 2 and download DayZ instead. It may be just a mod but at least you won't be giving money to a dishonest company who sell a game based on a Free to Play engine to an outrageous price for the quality of the final game. Cherry on the top the game isn't even cheat-protected ! It looks like they sold a game and then were like "Meh whatever we have the cash : that's all we care about". Bad developers bad game well... Everything is awfully bad with this game and those who made it. I would be glad to be able to note below 0... Sadly I cant.,0,Gameplay:The controls are to hard.Everything looks a bit awkward and unnatural.the character animations are to be desired.The combat animations are unkind  hit a Zombie on his head go back 2 steps wait for the blowback and hit again.The places with the best loot are mostly besieged by "bandits" who do not care about survival.

I've got this game a few months back for my wife. She's a fan of zombie games and I browsed war z a bit. "Obviously didn't do enough research" I got the game on her steam and played with it a bit. Keep in mind that the things I'm about to mention are about 3-4 months ago. 1  In character selection/creation... You are stuck playing as a male characterMy worse gaming experience ever... I've got this game a few months back for my wife. She's a fan of zombie games and I browsed war z a bit. "Obviously didn't do enough research" I got the game on her steam and played with it a bit. Keep in mind that the things I'm about to mention are about 3-4 months ago. 1  In character selection/creation... You are stuck playing as a male character and the female character is locked and needs to be unlocked. "My wife start getting upset about it already"2  There are only PvPvE servers and no PvE servers. So the moment you log into the server you may get killed instantly by another player.3  Every time you die you loose everything you've horded "We lost hours worth of items to some random player"4  You are stuck with a 1 hour cooldown before you can log back in.5  Many things in game shop (assuming you are spending money) are typically useless especially if you are gonna die and loose the items to a random person.6  There is no story or missions in this game... just play to build up points gathering survive die 1 hour cooldown... (Rinse and repeat)7  There are no vehicles or source of speedy transportation. You can literally spend a lot of time running across the map to get to another location while avoiding zombies and other players along the way.8  Every time you revive you start with nothing on you. You can't even fend for yourself with fists.9  If you managed to get any items you wish to save in storage you will have to walk/run your way back to the nearest safe zone to log out and unpack them.10  Personal bag space is limited... there are times you would run out of space and you are stuck deciding what to throw out be it weapons ammo food etc... (Think there was 6-8 bag slots.)11  With the way the game is set up... it can be very time consuming to play or just to wait for revival. Either way... every time you die you start from scratch  more time wasted  little to no progression  more frustration.12  Zombies path finding here is somewhat annoying... If you stood on top of a car or platform they sometimes clip through the object and hit you and if they didn't sometimes when you are beating them over their head they take no damage (or take forever to die) Over all the game concept was attractive at first... but in the end... it was a crappy experience for both my wife and I. Personally I wouldn't recommend this game. It's incomplete although they say it is a "Foundation Release" it just means their current product could be at bare minimum set up and it's a work in progress... For all I know the game might not even last through the end of the year with the way they are. The bad press didn't help it either. Save your money for something better or what not.,0,Ton of fanboy's with their positive reviews ya it can be a good game but it is being so rushed and it still seems like a mod of WarZ. I still jump on once in awhile but the game seems like its only 30% complete of a normal mmo release. Plus with all there false advertisement's I can't stand the Dev team. Avoid till end of next year maybe if they keep going.,0,I bought this game on Steam and when i found out AFTER i had bought the product that it was still in a largely unfinished state that the store page was actually misrepresenting the actual product...

I can't believe the people at STEAM did not vet this game before releasing it onto the public... If I were STEAMPOWERED.COM i would sue Hammerpoint Interactive for damages of reputation.,0,You would do a lot better by purchasing just about any other game rather than buying The War Z which is an abysmal and sorry excuse of a game. If you want to play a game that's about surviving a zombie apocalypse go and play DayZ  that's the game The War Z so desperately wishes it was and fails horribly at copying.,0,Game is a total scam.

In less than 5 sec You will be surrounded by instant spawned 20 zombies and get killed loosing all eq. Killing zombies? What for? ALL You got is 5xp per zombie  and nothing to spent those xp for.

The developers lie consistently about what content is in the game they blame it on the customers saying they are basically too stupid and should just generalize their facts for the best results. It's also close to impossible to get a refund on this game. Do yourself a favor - Just type in WarZ controversy in Google and you'll get all the facts you need to steer clear of this awful deceitful scam of a game.,1,Long story short this game is a giant scam. They made it so you have to constantly buy microtransactions. The game has been removed from Steam because of this. DO NOT BUY IT! Do not support these greedy conmen. Its so bad that the devs have come on this site giving it scores of 10. They are pathetic.,0,This game is horrible. Seriously don't buy it. It takes a lot of time and a lot of luck just to get a gun but most of the time another players kills you before you even find one. I bought an item from the market and I didn't even get it. This game is crap and the company should give everyone that bought it refunds.,0,"There is no such thing as 'release' for an online game" ~Sergey Titov That quote directly from the dev basically sums up everything wrong here.

No the game supports a maximum of 50 players on a server. They also say the game's maps are between 100 and 400 square km when at MOST there are some that are a maximum of 100 square km. The dev's official response to the accusation that this was a lie? "Okay -- if text is saying "up to 100 players" -- yes I may imagine situation when somebody will say "okay it HAVE TO BE 100." "Over 100 sq km" falls in "100 to 400" right?".  These are direct quotes taken from a gamespot interview with the dev.  To sum it up - the game was released in alpha stage quality the devs later called it a "foundation release".  It's a sloppy buggy game that is selling complete lies.  This is NOT an MMO this game does NOT support 100 players the maps are NOT 100 to 400km.  THERE IS ALSO NO SKILL TREE. Also should you die in the game you must pay REAL MONEY to respawn or wait 4 hours. This game is one of the most falsely advertised products I have ever encountered and I can only hope legal action is taken to force the developer to fully refund those duped by their marketing lies.,1,hack hackhack hack hackhack  hack hackhack  hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhackhack hackhack hack hackhack  hack hackhack  hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack hack hackhack,0,so i purchased this horrifically broken Day Z "clone"(lol) with the extra 2100 gp installed it fired it up and within the first 10 mins of playing died and lost all the 2100 gp worth of shiny new in-game crap that i had just purchased after i encountered the world's worst lag spike that i've ever seen in a game. this game is such a broken jumbled pile of dog droppings with graphicsso i purchased this horrifically broken Day Z "clone"(lol) with the extra 2100 gp installed it fired it up and within the first 10 mins of playing died and lost all the 2100 gp worth of shiny new in-game crap that i had just purchased after i encountered the world's worst lag spike that i've ever seen in a game. this game is such a broken jumbled pile of dog droppings with graphics that would look dated 10 years ago terrible AI glitchy gameplay and environments etc...pretty much this turd of a game isn't even ready for an open beta let alone be on store shelves. and on top of that the game's devs are lashing out at it's customers for calling them out for falsely advertising aspects of the game as selling points that just aren't there. honestly f*** this game and go play Day Z,0,The game is a scam and most of the features are a complete rip-off from Day Z.

Just look at the War Z forums to see the problems.,0,This is an awful game where you spend a large amount of time moving about slowly only to be killed by some "tough guy" who can use bots and exploits.,0,There is no game. In fact developpers are only thieves and swindlers who played with the desires of the players.

The developers are already cashing in on those who are unlucky enough to fall for the false promises made on this game. It's also extremely pay-to-win. After forking over real cash for fake credit you and another player can have a wallet battle where each person pays to respawn faster in order to regain the loot they lost. Eventually someone gives up and loses their stuff to the other guy or runs out of money and the developers have gotten the players to spend potentially huge amounts of money for absolutely nothing. It also robs the players of any reward they may have received by doing well unless they're willing to pay up to the developers in order to get their character to respawn faster than the other guy.,0,Buyer Beware this game fails to deliver!

Myself and a friend were both banned from the WarZ forums because we voiced articulate dislike for the mistreatment of us the players and how the game was failing to deliver. We didn't get warned or anything we were both permbanned. This was happening on the steam forums too until the entire forum was deleted. Then the recent interviews with the game's developer and lead designer. The refusal to give refunds the lying and false claims the blatant lack of appreciation for us the players supporting him and so much more has made me never EVER want anything to do with it ever again. I will NEVER support ANY game/idea/product from this person/developer again. I would not touch their product even if they offered to pay me. The game play is mediocre. The graphics are sub standard there is nothing memorable about the game itself. If it were just that I wouldn't feel so bad being out my money. But then We the players got kicked while we were down... repeatedly... The WarZ has been uninstalled and I am not looking back. I signed up for metacritic JUST to write this review because people need to know they type of dirty scummy grimy less than human A- Hole the dev team has been toward the gaming community as a whole. Please do not buy this game don't even try it at a friends place. This should be avoided at ALL costs. I am sorry I didn't do enough due diligence and I will never make this mistake again. -Sincerely- A very disgruntled gamer.,0,This is a disgrace to the Steam platform and gaming itself.

The game is far from finished and the steam page does NOTHING to acknowledge this. The fact that this game has micro-transactions on top of the purchase price is a kick in the teeth as-is; the fact that those micro-transactions are lost on death of your character is even more ridiculous. This is a game genre where you're expected to die so the in-game store is just a blatant cash-grab. Speaking of dying if you die then your character goes on cooldown and you need to wait 4 hours to use it again... unless you feel like paying real money to instantly revive. Add that on top of the game being buggy as hell painful to look at poorly optimized  fundamentally broken and more and you have quite possibly the worst game of 2012. And finally to top it all off the devs seem to believe it's a good idea to ban anyone from both the forums and the game itself for spreading the word that this game is absolute **** They also threaten to put certain people on a payment blacklist for the company that handles their micro-transactions; in other words because the WarZ devs don't like you they will try to tell the company they work with that you're not a trustworthy customer and that company will no longer accept your payments for ANY game not just WarZ. Oh and they're refusing refund requests. Yeah it's that horrible. Don't waste your money on this garbage.,0,This game is literally the worst thing I have ever seen.

From the beginning the playerbase was promised features and lo and behold when the game is officially released everyone is stuck dealing with placeholders and broken hopes. This game is no better in it's current state than it was in it's alpha. In fact the ironic part is a lot of the features in the game currently are STILL IN ALPHA. The reviews are pouring in and if you have rated this positively I legitimately feel sorry for you and would like you to know that you are in the minority. This game is an abomination in every sense of the word. The developers literally had to be called out in front of the whole Internet before they changed the false claims on the steam description page and EVEN STILL if you read the GameSpy review with Sergey the 'lead developer of the game' he blatantly ignores the fact that his game is incomplete and nothing but lies. I cannot even begin to continue with this review because I am so appalled by the business principles and overall general attitude of Sergey Titov and the rest of Hammerpoint Interactive. Congratulations guys you are absolutely what is killing gaming as we know it today.,0,Did you like Day Z?  Well take that free ARMA2 mod.  Now charge money for it.  Except take out the things that made it good.  Now add micro-transactions for items that you buy with real money and go bye bye when you get killed.  Make the map (singular) smaller. In no way should this game have been released in it's current state.  Seriously just wait for the Day Z standalone release.,0,Its a scam everyone don't buy into it!

Sadly enough I bought it before there could be 'lets plays' as I thought I'd be paying less then other people. Looks like I was wrong. They are now selling it for less then 15 bucks on steam. Beware the screenshots ! I only made this account to review WarZ and hopefully get it true to people that this game is not worth your money. Go see a movie !

The whole thing is a farce don't buy it.,0,Treat this "game" as if it were radioactive stay very very far away from it.

I had reasonable expectations for the game and was excited about another offering in this genre having played DayZ for months and loving every minute of it.  I knew that The War Z was just going to be a simplified "easier" version of DayZ that had more of a classic FPS feel to it that most gamers are familiar with as opposed to the mil-sim backbone dayz is based on.  I figured I would just play both games that I'd be able to enjoy them both for their own strengths....but The War Z has NO strengths.  It's terrible.  The zombies are less of a threat than the boars of the woods of c=Chernarus.  I'll admit I died when i met my first zed during alpha due to me not realizing you need to hit their head in order for them to actually die (a nice touch I'll admit) but once you realize you can stunlock pretty sizeable groups of zombies with a crappy flashlight and just kite them around you'll see them for what they are.  An incredibly minor slight annoyance.  They are boring as an enemy.  Nothing more than an early warning system for other players if you hear one aggro on anther person.  Its not just the zombies that are boring either the world itself makes me question if The War Z devs even played the game they're blatently ripping off.  The backround soundtrack and ambient noises are awful.  The sound quality is terrible and sometimes they play so loud that they drown out teamspeak (and they're tied to the other game sound effects like footsteps and gunfire so you cant just turn them down/off).  The world itself is completely barren there is no ambient wildlife to interact with and the cities are unimpressive at best.  Most of the buildings aren't enterable and even those that are are completely empty besides their loot spawns (no tables/chairs/no evidence whatsoever that anybody had even been inside of it before you).  The map is far smaller than even many of the user-made maps for DayZ let alone the official Chernarus map and you'll routinely run into invisible walls while trying to navigate the hilly and mountainous areas that are inside the boundaries of the map.  But its not just the PvE that blows.  The PvP is a joke.  The hacking is unbelivably rampant but even playing legitly I found myself completely unimpressed with the way the guns function.  There is no bullet drop but there is an arbitrary bullet cone which makes most longer range engagements an excersice in frustration.  There is also no in-game voice chat only text so there are no tense situations asking if another person is friendly anymore it's a shoot-on-sight fragfest (even more so than DayZ turned into if you can believe it.  After all who in their right mind is going to give up control of their toon to type for a moment?).  Their "global inventory" and in-game inventory means there is no survival aspect of the game anymore.  An assualt rifle takes up the exact same inventory slot as a can coke and most items stack so carrying 20 guns 400 bandages and 30 sets of binoculars is an easy feat and leads to global inventories with hundreds of weapons armor backpacks and an absurd amount of medical supplies (which you can equip new characters through meaning once youve got a good stash going a brand new character can spawn with assault rifles backup pistols huge packs full body armor and enough medical supplies to cure AIDS in all of Africa). This is missing everything from DayZ that made it such an engrossing experience.  It's missing a believable world it's missing the player interactions that made dayz such a heart pounder and there is even less to do in game than there is in the DayZ mod. tl:dr - The War Z brings nothing new to the table and sets the FPS genre back 10 years.  Don't waste your time.  Wait for DayZ standalone if the survival/horror genre interests you or just play L4D or COD/BF if the action/arcade genre is what you want.,0,This game is utter garbage specially when they have the audacity to charge money for a clearly uncompleted game (with no indication that this is clearly an alpha version of a game). DON'T BUY IT!,0,The War Z copied most things from their previous Game "The War Inc" they adde only a bigger map and zombies .. They said The War Z was in Devolpment 2 Years ( before DayZ ) that is a lie . The Screenshots on their Sites are only Concept Arts = so another Lie The War Z on Facebook begs for likes ..,0,Even if you ignore the fact that the developers of this game lied about its included features to get more sales even if you ignore the fact that this game is a blatant cash grab (with features such as charging you real money to shorten the 4 hour long respawn timer (yes you read that correctly)) even if you ignore the fact that the game is clearly not finished with mountains of bugs andEven if you ignore the fact that the developers of this game lied about its included features to get more sales even if you ignore the fact that this game is a blatant cash grab (with features such as charging you real money to shorten the 4 hour long respawn timer (yes you read that correctly)) even if you ignore the fact that the game is clearly not finished with mountains of bugs and a plethora of broken features even if you ignore the fact that the developers response to criticism is to insult the players in interviews to delete critical messages in the Steam forums and to force players to agree to terms of service which disallows refunds before you're allowed to play it's still a terrible game that would not be out of place in the clearance bin at a dollar store. If I gave this game to a friend as a joke gift they would never speak to me again and probably burn my house down for good measure. If when I started the game my pc monitor had exploded and thousands of glass shards had torn my face to pieces making me blind deaf and unable to taste anything for the rest of my life I would still have had a better experience than having to play this interminable game. Most of my anger at the shoddiness of this game is not directed at the developers though since they are clearly either educationally subnormal or moderately competent scam artists. Most of my anger is directed at Steam for allowing this shoddy unfinished game onto their service and taking their 30% cut of the sales. I never thought I would say this but I cannot see myself purchasing anything through Steam again unless this insult to gamers is removed from their service. Do not buy this game you will regret it.,0,this game is crappy it is really a huge scam don't buy it just wait for the DayZ standalone like i am even tho i never played the actual mod if Arma 2 co will be on sale i will get it just for the mod,0,Utter trash poorly optimized abysmal textures and horrid gameplay.

Besides the obvious issues of it just being a terribly crafted attempt to jump on the zombie survival bandwagon to milk whatever coin there may be left in the market the game has nothing going for it. It's nothing more then a mod for the less then average  War Inc. engine. Nothing works quite as it was probably intended bugs such as invisible zombies getting stuck in places and other wonderful "gameplay elements" are everywhere.I don't even feel the "survival" i expect form a zombie survival game because the zombies that the game does feature are blind and deaf cripples (no offense to people really) that are unable to detect your presence if you are further away then a meter or two; not to mention they don't really care about players going rambo with their gun and even if they notice you you can literally get away with a brisk walk.The only "survival" aspect the game offers is contained in the other 49 people on the map -great MMO by the way; 50 people is a lot honest- since they most likely will shoot you on sight to loot your things. Including the things you had to buy via microtransactions. Which is another sour thing: why are there microtransactions in a game you already paid for? I could at least somewhat understand if the game was great.All in all the game as such doesn't hold up to it's label if one has average standarts and expectations for a so called "Zombie Survival MMO" - since neither is there any survival nor any MMO in it and the zombies are just supernumeraries with a zombie skin. On top of that the constant lies of the Devs behind this so called game don't help the impression one gets in terms of what this thing is all about. False advertising with false screenshots promises of features that are not even in sight in the actual game let alone implemented. Their customer support and PR are very unfriendly and not helpful at all even to paying customers no less.,0,Do not get this game. It is a bad copy of the DayZ mod. Besides that it is bugged as hell. The features in advertisements are false. Some of them are not existing.

Thankfully they are offering a refund for this blatant cash grab game.  The majority of it's features are non existent and new features they have added since release are a joke.

In fact the majority of the developers efforts have gone into monetizing.  You can also buy weapons and supplies for real money but there isn't even a skill system(again advertised as complete) in place to spend the experience you earn from kills.  So what is the point of experience then?

They can not prove anything they state and just decides to ban people who criticize their "game". This game is not even a game. It's a remake of Sergey's earlier F2P game War Inc.

I've worked with both SCEA and Trion Worlds as functionality and balance testing not the most experience but enough to know what I'm looking at and what I'm looking for. While doings CS/TS I was at SoE which is the only company in the games industry I've done that for but I do have more experience than that. What I see when I played The War Z is not a finished product. I would hesitate to even call it a beta build. I have seen Alphas that have features more fully implemented in a game then this one has at a release to the general public. You have an MMO that has no friends list (coming soon really?) and only one map that fails to come anywhere near the size that was boasted about and promised. Couple that with the fact that the game is obviously geared to suck money out of your wallet to fund the company that put it out (world of tanks style) and I think I can safely say that this game is going to struggle from here on. Waiting to respawn your character for any period of time is crazy in a game where people can kill you even more so when you are going to limit the amount of characters a person can have. That's just the surface lets get to the next part. I do play Day Z but I was more then happy to give War Z a chance to prove itself that's why I payed money to buy it via steam. It has done nothing to impress me. It has shown to take what Day Z has done and water down parts and try and improve the graphics of it. It feels like it is a clone that is missing some of the wonderful things that make Day Z great something I would be willing to look past if it actually seemed like it was going to be free once the initial purchase was done. The fact that you are making people pay for a game and then expect them to spend even more money is laughable at best you should have taken a page out of League of Legends (since you took their ToS at the start) and tried to stick closer to that. A free game that if you want to you can spend money in for small things that will not improve your game play. Finally I see a problem with how you are handling the community. You are saying that people are lying simply to save face or at least implying it about being banned wrongfully. You should ]NEVER come out and say that about your customer even if it is true. If a player feels they were banned and shouldn't have been then you should give them a fair chance to present their case and give them a response in a timely manner. If you can not respond to all customers in a timely manner which considering what is happening right now I would think is happening you should at least send you a generic response to all open tickets that you are extremely busy and working on getting back to them. At least let them know that you are trying to handle everyone's problems communication is more important than most people think when they become a suit. So for those of you that are tl;dr here is the break down. The game feels like it is still in alpha not something that should have been released. The concept for the micro-transactions is completely off base for an MMO and makes it feel like you are desperately trying to pull in money to finish the game. Your custom service team is most likely swamped and not even close to prepared for the influx of customers an MMO is going to bring you with problems. Your community team is treating people terrible on the forums from the majority of the reports which will hurt your company in the long run.,0,The War Z is a bad excuse for a game worth charging money for.

Many others started using hacks to stay alive from the hacking bandits. The models are poorly put together in some places and leave gaps that are only visible from one angle. Few are friendly and a 4 hour wait to respawn makes it apparent the developers don't really want you to PLAY just give money.

So pathetic valve removed it off steam... Horrible games are like  bad rats... There is so much more it isn't funny...,0,Game has a good foundation but the error is how manufacturers are not listening to what the players think. they are downright miserable out of listening to us players,0,MONEY MONEY MONEY thank god this **** game got taken off steam and i really hope it never comes back its nothing but a cheap rip-off from DayZ you lied about so many features that it says on your forums. + you mean the respawn time 4 hours or you can pay money you greedy fat **** All warz is lies its all lies lies lies 100 people on a server NOPE skill tree NOPE,3,Unfortunately when a game company acts in a disgraceful way It's very hard for me to even look at the game.

False advertising being rude to customers lying about statistics game features and about the company itself. This is clearly a pop up company planned to make as much money off a false pretense and then running. The game itself isn't even that bad! The game it's clearly based on is the popular Arma 2 mod "DayZ" and so it has so much room for potential except they are more worried about money than actually making a good game. Steam is a trusted online store and the fact that they published these blatant lies on the store page either shows cooperation with this company or that they take no care and attention to what they sell you. Either way this should hurt Steams reputation a lot more than it probably will. As this is a score for the game itself I feel it is still around a 3 but a little side note.

I was thrilled by the prospect of WarZ. their pitch for the alpha was brilliant. it was like the Dayz i already loved but with more and built as its own game with a new team and new ideas. man that game i *thought* i bought was going to be awesome!!!but it hasnt happened. and based on the limited input from the developers it may never happen. i still have hope...that the warz i dreamed of could still be a reality...that i will get to play that beautiful terrifying game with all my friends and everything will be puppies and rainbows.... rabid zombie puppies..but do i believe it will happen??i dont know...i just dont know...,0,This game is utter garbage   a very poor port over from War Inc   asking for a refund gets you threatened with being blacklisted for further online purchases!!!.    its a total scam   Avoid at all costs.

Placing items inside of walls which only people using ESP would know about. This led to a lot of legitimate player accounts being banned. There's a so-called anti-cheat system which analyses player patterns - this isn't good enough. I might as well go and buy some hacks now I'll never get caught. - Each patch seems to fix 5 bugs and introduce 10 more. Patch release dates as well as promised features are constantly late or not implemented at all. Other patches introduce things which are blatant money making schemes. Changing revive times to 4 hours but then adding an option to PAY to revive instantly for example right on top of Christmas when they know more people will be playing and have money to spend - despite the fact that you're probably going to die to hackers more often than not. - Lying about features in the game - and then blaming customers for 'misinterpreting' information - the information could only be interpreted one way - it's a blatant case of false advertising (STEAM removed it from sale the same day it was launched on there. Also check out the article on Forbes and GameSpy for more info.),0,This game was recently removed from Steam a few days after it was added. Not surprising considering its pre-alpha stage release. The graphics are considerably inferior to what you'd normally see from a game released in 2012 the servers hold a maximum of 50 people (the devs promised around 250) and lots of features promised are either broken or unimplemented (such as the skills).

The graphics are considerably inferior to what you'd normally see from a game released in 2012 the servers hold a maximum of 50 people (the devs promised around 250) and lots of features promised are either broken or unimplemented (such as the skills). The zombies are broken - they can hit you even if you're not close to them and for instance a baseball bat hit to the head will do much less damage than a gunshot from a 9mm pistol to the foot. Another major problem is the fact that falling from a light slope will hurt your character. Also you can't swim!The developers are also extremely unprofessional - they do not refund unsatisfied costumers and frequently insult other players on the forums (the most well-known case being the producer accusing campers of being f**gots).In short if you want an awful broken unbalanced game then this one's for you. Otherwise just stay away from it...,0,Game (can you even call this a game) is terrible is copy paste all over the place ideas art music everything is taken from other games movies etc... not worth a single buck.,0,I never thought I should make a review like this.

I'm always careful when I buy a new game and I always check the reviews or play the demo before I decide if I want the game or not.But not this time... For the first time I bought something spontaneously... and I was PUNISHED!Reading about it on steam and I really was like "WOW... this must be great I've always wished a zombie apocalyptic mmorpg and this sounds really cool.... But I was very dissappointed. First of all they claimed: "This is not a pay to win game" ... And well... Maybe they are right I don't know. But it is certainly a "pay to play game" with lots of glitches and ingame hackers. With all those hackers you have a chance of surviving about maybe half an hour that is if you stay in the forest cause the bandits (and hackers) are camping outside both safezones and cities... But after this half an hour you will need to move to the city and gather supplies but you got nothing- you can't even use your fists actually you can ONLY run so you have no chance to defend your self when campers encounter you.... Cause you can't do any damage at all. So: You get this half an hour of gameplay where you can do nothing but hide in the forest and the when you head to the towns and die you will have to wait 4 hours before you can revive your character and play again... It's nothing but another pvp but a pvp where you spawn close to campers with nothing to defend your self with- (again) not even your fists. And then when you spawn in front of campers/bandits you die and have to wait 4 hours before you can spawn again! (you do not have any options that allows you to play pve- or just alone with friends. you CAN'T  host own servers- so you have to play pvp!- with hackers bandits etc) So my adwise must be: STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! Not only is the game unplayable... The developers are lying cheating greedy and worst of all they actually ban innocent players who point out the problems to be solved. The developers does not want to make a game... They want to make some money!!! I apologize for my bad english.. It is not my mother tongue.

Do not buy.,0,This game is disgusting it shouldn't even be called a game. It's shockingly bad. Such a scam cancer literally worse than Hitler aidsgame.

This game has so much potential but currently is still pretty bad.  With the choices the dev is making it will never be great ...let alone mediocre. There's a lot of criticism and technical detailed info out on the web so I won't repeat.  However the community is one of the worst you'll find in the MMO world.  If you love CoD-type hardcore PvP you'll be right at home.  If you're looking for a survival game where the real focus is on killing zombies you won't find satisfaction in WarZ. You start out with nothing that will give you a chance to survive a close zombie encounter which forces you into buildings that are typically stalked by PvP players who kill you for a granola bar.  Many WarZ players that love the game overlook the approach the dev is taking to nickel-and-dime consumers as well as his pathetic forum moderation which bans users for criticizing the game.  While DayZ has negative aspects as well it has a great developer that cares about releasing an excellent product - something the WarZ peeps are not focused on.,0,Its just AWFUL AWFUL game.

There is a lot of money in gaming both legitimate and illegitimate to be had. Its a grey area of the law especially international law and I know that organized crime has their hand in both the gold seller market as well as the game development markets. People laugh when I say that but there are billions of dollars in this industry and just like American crime has their hands in various industries. Gaming is a ripe fruit just waiting to be plucked by them. They'd be stupid to pass it up. So what do I think of WarZ? It blatantly steals content from other games. They ripped League of Legend's ToS They plagiarized images from The Walking Dead and they stole at least one UI from Crysis. The developers are lying through their teeth while threatening anyone demanding a refund with having Paypal blacklist you as an "Untrustworthy user". What they're doing would be against several US Federal laws but since they're in Russia they get away with it. Otherwise Hammerpoint would have already been sued to the ground which is what should happen. Vanilla WoW's graphics are better than The War Z the controls are clunky the hackers are everywhere there a ONE HOUR respawn time (Which further proves that the devs are far out of touch with gamers) There's a really bad in-game cash shop that will not stop bothering you that there's a cash shop you lose all of your items whenever you are killed even if they're items bought in the cash shop the GM's are abusive in-game and will ban legitimate players for nothing while spawning their own items to kill you on sight. I've been to their forums as well. They're using a crappy PhP forum that looks as if it was made by a teenager the forum staff can't hold themselves to the standards they set for the users the entire community is toxic any thread asking for a refund gets locked deleted and the user get's banned. Everything about this company is unprofessional and should be avoided. If you are someone who's enjoying this game awesome. Good for you. Sadly the majority of players refuse to deal with a game this bad and with a company so fraudulent.,0,Game is a straight rip off from Day Z!

At the start of its release I actually supported this game. But from the decisions ive seen them make they have made  major errors in regards to false advertising which in my case is in the top five in my hate list.  To top that off ive found that the GC they charge in game is way to expensive and to top that off they increased the respawn time to 4hrs and wacked at "quick revival" fee onto that aspect of the game. Which costs 50GC. Originally they said all items on the market will be available in game. Personally I havent seen half the good items on the marketplace spawn. All these aspects they introduce screams "Cash cow" to me and makes me think developing this game is not a priority for them. If they spent half that time in developing the game maybe they would get rid of some of the poor sound effect like walking over rocks that sound like a metal platform. To top that off ive seen some info on the net that suggests admins are abusing their powers and spawning items for themselves (including items that cost GC) and their team mates. Hopefully that ones not true but everything else up top is spot on. The game has potential but i believe the wrong devs are behind the wheel. Overall though its still entertaining and cheap to purchase. Just dont buy any GC. Ive given this game a 3. If they werent so dishonest and rushed it to release when its actually still in beta I would have marked it up to about 6 maybe 7.,1,Only good thing about this game is its graphics (relative to price) and food/thirst sound/sight features. Gameplay is buggy and very poor. Game mechanics equally bad (to easy to die (bugs/hackers etc) and 1 hour respawn time). unpopulated and featureless.

God forbid you die by the hackers that run rampant and unchecked in the game and immediately lose everything you just paid real money for. Then are no longer allowed to play for the next 4 hours. The development team ahs broken the law on numerous occasions aswell. With blatant false advertising (which they put down to the users "misreading" the page. How do you write "100 players per server" while it's only 50 and then blame the userbase for misreading it?) and then a huge case of fraud: In order to get a refund on this game which I urge everyone to do you must agree to the terms of service (which are copypasted verbatim from the League of Legends terms of service including links to the league of legends websites) but this terms of service agreement has the added feature of disallowing you from asking for a refund. So in order to get a refund you have to sign a piece of paper that says you can't have a refund then ask for a refund. I wonder what the outcome of that will be. I should also mention the solution to preventing hackers: Permanently ban lots of random members (so they have to guy the game AGAIN) to scare the hackers but don't actually do anything to prevent them.,0,http://warzscam.tumblr.com/  says it all as to WHY it is a terrible game and why it must be avoidable! ppl are STILL saying the game is in beta?? they got no clue whats going on sergey already stated the game is not alpha or beta anymore! if people did their research on the game or even read the warz forums/steam warz forums. they would know WHY there is ton of hate towards it againhttp://warzscam.tumblr.com/  says it all as to WHY it is a terrible game and why it must be avoidable! ppl are STILL saying the game is in beta?? they got no clue whats going on sergey already stated the game is not alpha or beta anymore! if people did their research on the game or even read the warz forums/steam warz forums. they would know WHY there is ton of hate towards it again this game is just a SCAM!!!,0,OK not only is it a bad game maybe 1 or 2 out of 10 because of boring story and layout glitches and really a genre that just can't work it is also a marketing scam.

I have been playing this game since Oct 15th and as for potential it has a lot of it. The problem arises from a few different front first and foremost hackers. Unfortunately the person at the top made a wild boast that the game was unhackable you know what that did in the cheating community encouraged them to create and sell cheats and they are rampant in WarZ. The other problem is for whatever reason promised features are missing and in all honesty don't appear to be getting added to the game. The only thing that gets added are features that were in War Inc a game that Hammerpoint created that uses the same engine. The community has been promised many features few of which we've actually seen none of which are even close to polished. The game is ok for what it is at this point but grows stale with time. Lack of new features and very little to do other than kill other players in a deathmatch atmosphere means that this game is not as billed. Can it be saved? Sure but time is running out.,0,This game is scam. Don't even try it. Inform yourself via google first. The games producer steals insults and threathens people who criticize their product.,0,The idea is GREAT - the game and support of the developer however...just WOW....everyone else has pretty much stated anything I could hope to convey in a message - these guys for sure was just wanting to make a fast buck and this time the end-users seem to be letting a company know - they aren't going to take any crap this time around.,0,A shame and disgrace to the gaming industry DO NOT LET THEM RIP YOU OFF.

Avoid at all costs. Developers lied through their teeth on steam store page and the steam userbase were so enraged that this game has been removed from steam and everyone given their money back.,0,You can't help but feel that Hammerpoint tried to nickle and dime gamers and worse they tried to do it on the back of another title. It's a terrible case of a developer trying to take advantage of gamers.  It might also have been more palatable if the game wasn't the mess that it currently is.  All I can say is. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Rather save your money! This is complete and utter trash.,0,My recommendation to ANYONE is to spend your money elsewhere.  This game features the worst games have to offer in one insanely bad package.  From random death glitches standing still in a forest suddenly kills you to the most unbalanced combat ever created.

You're a slow moving easy to hit target for anyone who has a gun.  Sprinting to cover also has no effect as you'll be twoshotted at any range.  Devs don't seem to be overly interested in altering the mechanics.  Furthermore there really isn't anything fun about the game.  After being forced to delete/create a new character because they put a one hour respawn on your other one ( like it has any use?) you go back in with your trusty ol flashlight and restart your search for a gun.  Everything else seems plentyful.  Crisps and chocolate bars all over the place. Next up: features!  There are none to speak of.  Everything they advertise is not implemented and most likely never will be.  I'm not going to waste more of your time on this failure of a game.  Look elsewhere or buy Call of Duty if you want an easy turkey-shoot.  Play DayZ if you want a better zombie survival mmo.,0,4 hours for respawn or 0.40$ to revive. No thank you Hammerpoint. This kind of shady cash grabbing deserves no other answer and rating. Unfortunate but I think we gamers must make a point here and stop this kind of stuff before it spreads.

Until then the only good experience of this game is being able to un-install it.,1,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Wanted to confirm the hype rather than just let controversy bubble. I bought the game because I had the money to spend. Now I want it back and can't get it back. IF this game was an alpha beta test release or anything I would frame this review in a different light. Everyone agrees that DayZ is a fantastic mod to a beautiful game Arma II that was not intended to become a complete game until it vehemently soared. WarZ on the other hand was written out to be a "foundation" release on Steam currently which bears no meaning to the gaming community. It is in any other sense an Alpha release because of it is still in active development. However since it is a working non-free game my judgement is based on the fact that I expect a game to be without blatant issues after having paid for it. Forums around the world are alight because of their blatantly poor business practices -- releasing a game lacking in mentioned features expecting people to be okay with paying for a fixer-upper forgetting to remove "league of legends" from the LoL TOS that they stole implementing a poor in-game marketplace where unbeknownst to players one loses all gear paid or not upon character death banning players and not hackers and generally making it clear that they're creating a game for profit by profiteers. You walk in to find that textures are shoddy and your FoV is like looking through a pinhole after playing other FPS's. My first impression was that the average WarZ gamer is your average DayZ gamer: there is no tutorial or manual so game dynamics are learned. For a paid release I'd expect WarZ to have opened up to new players with a tutorial. You're given a map. First thing I notice is the sporadicy of the environment. It's a long walk to the nearest town. Once I was there I learned that zombies are very attracted to even a slight bumping of the sprint key. It takes about half your stamina to completely outrun them. After dying a few times I began to loot towns. The only loot I found in 3 hours of play was sustenance a helmet and a hammer. The hammer is a 4-5 hit kill for zombies. In this period of time I spent 60% of it running to the destination 30% running away from zombies and the remainder dying from other players hackers and creating new characters. The learning curve is steep. After a while I began to get a feel of zombie's detection radii and how to interact with other players speedily without using the textual chat. I made way through almost every lootable building in the city of Campos and left very well endowed. Then walking through forest I died. I was lucky to spawn once to the military base and found an M4 and some wearable armor. I was using caps lock to speak in skype but i accidentally hit the sprint (shift) key in the middle of the base which by itself causes the character to sprint. This attracted a mass of zombies that couldn't fit through the door of the hanger. I unloaded the 30 round clip at head level only killing 4 of about 30. My stamina was also expired so that was the end of the character. This game is an alpha so I expect it to have glitches and poor gameplay but I paid for this game expecting it didn't. Can anyone see what's wrong with that sentence? In all honesty I hope my purchase was a preorder to a decent game or will be returned to me once Hammerpoint is finished with lawsuits and hate from their 200000 disgruntled gamers. Meanwhile I'm enjoying the absolute lulz this game has brought to the table.,1,The company behind the game is a group of scamers going for a fast cash grab.

As of right now its unreviewable since its downright unplayable so that makes it a Zero in my book.  This game is an FPS with a 1 hour respawn timer and cash shop.  Buying items with real money in this game is for stupid noobs since its a full loot game.  You will most likely get killed as soon as you zone into the game. Currently you are only given four choices in this game.1)Create a Normal mode player to be played on any server.2)Create a Hardcore mode player to be played on any server.3)Logout.4)Uninstall. I prefer option 4!

And arktos "entertainment" wont even explain to their customers why their game is so very **** They just treat them like nothing.,1,Simply one of the worst games i have played.

Instead buy arma 2 and enjoy a far superior mod called day z.,0,I originally purchased this game on the release date because a group of friends were all buying into it and were speaking highly of the video footage etc. that had been released. Ignoring the terrible launch I managed to get in a day later and start playing I then realized what a terrible mistake I had made this is honestly one of the worst multiplayer games claiming to be a AAA gameI originally purchased this game on the release date because a group of friends were all buying into it and were speaking highly of the video footage etc. that had been released. Ignoring the terrible launch I managed to get in a day later and start playing I then realized what a terrible mistake I had made this is honestly one of the worst multiplayer games claiming to be a AAA game I have ever played. A couple of key issues: The company is completely unprofessional; swearing and calling people out is common.Animations are terrible.Graphics aren't anything to write home about.Zombies are useless and can be avoided incredibly easy.Hacks are readily available for the game.Forum moderation is something Hitler would have been proud of. So after all that I decided I'd request my refund before the game launched (I had played it for a day for exactly 1 hour). First of all their support is terrible it took 7 days to get a response completely avoiding my issue and almost begging me to wait until the game goes to beta stage I refused and persisted for a refund this is where the contact went dead for 9 days after which they responded with "You have played the game for x minutes you are not entitled to a refund". This infuriated me so I jumped on the phone with my bank and explained the issue within 2 hours I had the money back in the account and guess what? I can still play the game not that I'd want to. The amount of lying cheating and lack of professionalism shown by this company amazes me in a sector that is growing incredibly each year we do not need these people people complain saying that the media frenzy has been blown out of proportion. I don't think it has in fact I think it won't be done until the company has been buried no-one should be allowed to act in the way that Hammerpoint has. There are thousands of reviews on this site and each person is entitled to their own opinion but honestly if anyone happens to read this review please save yourself your time and money and avoid the game. I will be happy knowing that maybe someone else will be spared the frustration of dealing with a fraudulent company.,1,This game is a sad attempt to make money off of the success of the popular mod DayZ. Some people might disagree even though they are wrong let them live in their world were War Z is the superior game I'm sure it is a happy world covered in ignorance.

Some people might disagree even though they are wrong let them live in their world were War Z is the superior game I'm sure it is a happy world covered in ignorance. But the real truth about this game is even though it ripped off a game mod that is in Alpha they didn't fix any problems; if anything they just expanded on the problems and got rid of some good things of DayZ. For starters they have a horrible business model pay for the game (that is NOT finished) then make people buy more items with real cash in game that they can later loose if they die so they can buy more items making more money They clearly do not care about the customer at all and I wouldn't be surprised if they just canceled the game and ran off with the money. Don't get me wrong this game has potential but with the work of the horrible DEVs banning everyone who doesn't like the game and customer support refusing to give people refunds on a game they were told was finished (which is illegal by the way) shows that they only entertain the game until people stop paying attention to it. The only way this game could of been amazing from the start was if they made it free to play and kept the micro transactions to feed their money hunger so everybody wins. The company gets their money and customers do not feel like they have been duped into buying a unfinished game due to being free to play. But right now the damage is done and this is game will most likely fail even with the cult following they have. The only thing we can do is sit and wait for after the holidays and see how the company reacts to these haters and lovers of the game. And see if they release any plan for the game and if they will respect the customers for their refunds. If they don't do any of these things I suggest you get out of that game as soon as possible because these business ethics are not one you as a customer should be supporting.,1,Zombie MMO is conceptually interesting but when you get into the game its terrible. Death respawns are ridiculously long (4hrs). Running around aimlessly with nothing to do except hunt noobs and grief people or help people. I found no actual purpose or goal with this game. Waste of money even on sale.,1,I feel sorry for anyone who had purchased this piece of s***. The game is very unforgiving when killed by a zombie or another player you may have a wait time of 3 F***ING HOURS to respawn!! Not to mention that you lose everything you found and bought.

This game is utterly bad terrible! The textures are even worse than DayZ a free to play mod for the game Arma II and DayZ doesn't even have that good textures. The gameplay is terrible if you walk down croch or crawl down a 1 meter high hill you will lose about 25% of your health most of the time from fall damage you can't swim and if there's one zombie you're fighting you're invincible as to if there are two zombies+ attacking you you should just let them kill you. My God the running is so slow. when you sprint it looks like you're walking fast! One of the worse things about this game you can buy weapons and consumables before you even start you lose that on death and by the way when you die you have to wait FOUR HOURS to respawn OR you can pay to respawn instantly. So if you die by fall damage from a hill that's not even as tall as your player and you spent money on buying a weapon or other items you're screwed.  The WarZ staff are banning people that criticize the game badly on the forums and there are rumors that the devs spawn stuff in for themselves. Not only that but the staff/devs are blackmailing the players asking for a refund threatening to put them on the global blacklist restricting them from buying certain games or other items. Their terms of service was copied word for word from the game League of Legends. Let's take a look at the broken promises from their original steam store page(It's been edited now): "The War Z is a Survival Horror MMO that immerses players in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic world in which a viral outbreak has decimated the human population leaving in its wake a nightmare of epic proportion"  No mention of game being in alpha/beta and without all features "A Huge Persistent World. The War Z is an open world game. Each world has areas between 100 to 400 square kilometers."  There is only one map and it is 72 square kilometers "Play with friends. Hundreds of Servers to Play on and you can also rent and create public or private servers allocating spots for Friends or Clans."    No private servers in the game. "No Classes. No Levels. No Caps. Create your own survival campaign gain experience points and psend it to learn dozen of available skills"  There are no skills you can use currently in the game. "Up to 100 players per game server"  When the game first came out the mac players on it was 50 players. "Dedicated public servers as well as private servers"  Again there are no private servers. Hammerpoint Interactive the creators of The War Z in my opinion were trying to cash in on the success of a mod for Arma II DayZ and the rushed out a game not even close to coming out in which I believe is an alpha/beta version. 1/10 from me for their original idea everything else was either not finished or poorly done. The developers are immature and will ban players using bully tactics.,1,The core mechanics are very simple but are fun in a brutally realistic sort of way... but you have never seen a game more hacked out than this.

In a game that is predominantly about stealth and survival a game aiming for realism the hacking is so annoying you will literally scream in frustration.    Imagine sneaking through an army base finding precious loot: an M-16 (a rare treat in this game) some body armor (holy snikies batman!) and a a bunch of ammo! (Wow! It's like you won the lottery!) And then you are sneaking into the safe zone looking at every bush. You're like a carjacker driving back to dump your loot. Your pulse is racing as you hit your keyboard. You are almost at the safe zone. You are checking your back. Clear.   You are almost safe...  then you are killed by an invisible hacker with a hammer.    You will want to scream. Getting loot (or losing loot you bought) is so incredibly difficult yet 35% of my deaths have been due to hacking (no exaggeration). And these hacks are insane hacks too... wallhacks aimbots flying ESP invisibility and even infinite endurance... they've covered almost every power the X-Men possess. Put simply don't buy this game.,0,There are a lot of issues with this game varying from its unending bugs to its uninterested developers. There are bugs in the mechanics of the game and an over-abundance of guns with purchasable ammunition allowing players to arm themselves in relatively short time and resulting in new players effectively being shot on site.The game is filled with hackers and the developers atThere are a lot of issues with this game varying from its unending bugs to its uninterested developers. There are bugs in the mechanics of the game and an over-abundance of guns with purchasable ammunition allowing players to arm themselves in relatively short time and resulting in new players effectively being shot on site. The game is filled with hackers and the developers at Hammerpoint have clearly demonstrated they have no interest in dealing with this issue properly. They utilize a hack prevention system that they consider 'perfect' and have wrongfully banned hundreds or possibly thousands of their own users. Sergey from Hammerpoint has promised refunds to players with fewer than five hours on their account but has not delivered on this promise. Sergey from Hammerpoint has shown in interviews he feels no shame or regret for lying on the games Steam description (the debacle and grossly incompetent actions by Hammerpoint Interactive have resulted in Steam actually pulling the game from their platform hopefully permanently) and blames the users for misreading the description. There has been active moderator abuse both on the forums and in game ranging in action from banning members with no good reason to spawning items in game (some that cannot even be obtained by legitimate means at this point in time) and giving them to their friends (using the excuse "we're going to play until we die so someone will get this stuff we're getting more gear out there") at this point going out and killing legitimate PAYING PLAYERS with their hacked gear. Keep in mind these are the moderators not random hackers who slipped into the game unnoticed. Sergey has clearly demonstrated his absolute incompetence in the field of game development (see: Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing) and has shown that he is equally unsuited to function in public relations community administration & moderation or account administration. This is a person who should not be involved with or engaged in the gaming industry. Many people are calling for charges of fraudulence and false advertising and I could not agree more. If this development cycle was not an absolute money grabbing con I don't know what is. I'm now 32 days into repeated requests for a refund and now am making efforts to contact Xolla and other companies related to the transaction as Hammerpoint Interactive is ignoring my contact requests. I am well under their defined 5 hour playtime limitation on refunds. This is a disgusting excuse for a development and should be left to die and fester in its own horrid waste.,0,This is a joke of a game.

I thought maybe the game had a shot if they were calling this a an alpha or a beta but the lead game developer just came out and said "As far as I'm concerned The War Z is in a stage when we're ready to stop calling it Beta.

If you spend money on their cash shop you lose any item you buy when that character dies permanently. I have a migraine just from trying to understand how a game this unfathomably bad could be released on Steam or to the public in any way. If this game was in beta I'd still tell all my friends to avoid it but it's a full release?!,4,BUYER BEWARE! This game is being advertised with features that aren't in the game.

Player interactions are intense and sneaking through towns to get loot is definitely exciting. However with all of that said this game is quite a lackluster. The graphics and animations are poorly done the game world is empty and there's hardly any depth to the game which would indicate that this game has been in development past alpha testing.--------------------------------------------------------- Perhaps later on down the road the game will deserve a higher rating but as it stands now there's a lot to be desired. The rating I'm going to give this game a four out of ten.,2,Ok here is the deal. I purchased this game Oct 14th at the pioneer level. I played it and had a blast. I have been playing ever since and have seen all the changes that have been made. Some good some not so good.

I went into this knowing full well I was playing an alpha build and knew there would be bugs for a while and several changes would be made. Yes I have played DayZ for some time prior to purchasing this game and that is actually the reason I found this game. I never came into this spiteful that it was ripping off DayZ. I have read just about every rant and rave people had and also everything the developers came back with. It was a little hard to swallow but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I get killed a lot by bandits not always hackers but sometimes my deaths are too fishy to even have a doubt that some horseplay was going on. I just suck it up and load a new character and enjoy what time I spend alive in game. It has now become too much for me to stomach. Consistently being killed after 3 minutes in game is crazy. Take a look at Youtube and all of the hacks that there are for this game. I realize that they have banned over 3k people and that they are trying to fight it but laying traps for people and banning innocent players is excessive. I have not even mentioned the fact that I payed what I believed was a "pre-release deal" at 40 some dollars and now its on steam for around 15 bucks. I just dislike overpaying and being told I was getting a deal. Are you a game company comprised of used car salesmen? I have read Gamespys interview and I have just about had enough with this whole debacle. I don't even want my money back. I want an apology for making promises that you could not deliver and over charging me and many others to fund your development of this now third rate game. Sincerelya once loyal fan,2,SCAM! RIP OFF!

Everyone who has power in the gaming world needs to come forward and put an end to this. If this company is allowed to continue there is no telling what else will be allowed. Please for the sake of the future of gaming of Steam... to show people how blind they are. I still see many people saying the game is "fine" even though they are the minority even with the proof they have been lied to and cheated they still defend this company.

This game is basically a pay to win styled game yet you can lose items that you have paid for with your hard earned cash by spawning in a server and getting camped by a bunch of people who are equally as bored as you are in this game. This game promises prominent features that aren't even in the game yet and I doubt that the lazy liar of a team of developers won't ever implement any of these said features any time soon. And don't listen to the apologists who insist that this game is still in a "Alpha" format. This game has already gone through said "Alpha" and even "Beta" stages. The developers don't even indicate that its still in "Alpha" they constantly persist that the game is in a complete state and is worth your hard earned cash. This game deserves every piece of bad rep that it has endured and no one should ever waste their money or time on it. Remember this game was pulled from Steam for being a giant sack of malarkey.,0,This game is absolutely awful. Please do not waste your money on this game that is a clear rip off of DayZ and is under supported by this greedy banhappy developer.

I've been active on the original forums since then as well.  I'm a "Pioneer" (one of the 3 titles available to be chosen by early testers that stays with our accounts forever). I'll try to be as objective as I can with this explanation. 1) Alpha/Beta/Gold -Beta was determined with the wipe. AllI've been playing the game since day 1 in Alpha (or at least the 'buy in" Alpha stage). I've been active on the original forums since then as well.  I'm a "Pioneer" (one of the 3 titles available to be chosen by early testers that stays with our accounts forever). I'll try to be as objective as I can with this explanation. 1) Alpha/Beta/Gold -Beta was determined with the wipe. All weapons all characters all money etc... were wiped from Alpha to Beta. That was the point in the game when the devs said the beta was ready. Beta was due on Nov 30th. It over extended by a few days (Dec 4th). Wipe was done and we were told that the next stage was the "foundation release." http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?65228-Foundation-Release-state-of-the-game-new-features Of the mentioned features it currently contains only about 60%. 2) STABILITY - I've not had any issues in a while. I think they got this worked out for the most part (mileage may vary). 3) BUGS - there will always be bugs but certainly the most game breaking were resolved. I rarely notice any bugs at this stage of the game now. 4) ADVERTISED FEATURES -This is where the game fails miserably and it's odd because all that needs to be done to rectify this issue is to NOT advertise that they are in the game when they aren't and to use actual images of the game. That last point images of the game: 100% of all the images you see advertised for this game...are not actually IN GAME footage. They are greatly enhanced. They are rendered images for marketing. But the devs have misleadingly used these rendered images to entice players into the game. I've been playing since Alpha. These images were up BEFORE Alpha. The game has NEVER been in a state graphically that was representative of the images. Misleading advertisement: *each world (implying multiple) is 100-400 km. - there is only 1 map MAYBE around 100 km at most*private servers - no*dedicated public servers - no*skills - no*friends list - no*up 100 player servers (it's 50...and 50 would be included in "up to"...so technically true still misleading which is the MO for this developer it seems)*"meld of pve and pvp" - no it's pure pvp. Zombies do exist and are a threat but that's hardly pve IMO there no NPC mission givers and there won't ever be (as per the devs) This is in addition to the features mentioned previously. All of these features are planned and most will be added probably in Jan 2013 - March 2013. 5) CHEATING - Cheating is rampant. Cheats are easy to find for the game. While the devs have implemented a few detection systems and are banning some players there is still a lot of work to be done. This is one of the primary reasons people are wanting dedicated/private servers. Many clans want a server for only their clan and trusted friends/allies to cut down on all the rampant cheating (my own included MOG). Summary I believe the game has potential. It is being worked on constantly by the devs. They do have a lot of features planned for it. I personally found it to be a bit boring after a while since there isn't much to do really IMO. It's great the first time you start playing big area to explore. But then all you are really doing is collecting gear. They have been advertising another feature Bounties for a very long time now but that looks to be pushed far down on the list. Vehicles were supposed to come by end of month that doesn't look like it is going to happen w/i that time frame now. There will be no NPC's giving quests ever. Devs have been quite clear about this. Instead they want to eventually create a system where players create quests. But that's far down the road. Look at the YouTube vidoes for actual game play to see if this game would be a good fit for you. The game's state and way it is being developed seems to divide players. It is by no means a polished well developed game but neither is it a game that is completely devoid of effort or filled with game breaking bugs. I believe the devs will eventually implement the features they said they would but it may be a couple months before that is done. But what you are getting if you buy this game as of the time of this post is absolutely unequivocally not what is being advertised. I don't know that there has ever been a Steam game that has had so few features in existence that are advertised to exist. I'm surprised Steam allowed the game to be sold. I know some games have done this exact same thing (advertised something that wasn't true) and IMO this new trend that Steam is allowing is harmful to its integrity and the community. Currently on Steam there is no better of example of "You will not get what is advertised" than War Z.,4,TL;DR: Is it better than DayZ?  No.Is it bad in its current shape?  Yes.Is it ****  Not quite.Does it have potential to be better?  Maybe but I wouldn't bet on it.WarZ has the unpleasant disadvantage of being compared to DayZ.  As a consequence a lot of players see this game as being vastly inferior to its predecessor.And they would be right.I'll start with what theTL;DR: Is it better than DayZ?  No.Is it bad in its current shape?  Yes.Is it ****  Not quite.Does it have potential to be better?  Maybe but I wouldn't bet on it. WarZ has the unpleasant disadvantage of being compared to DayZ.  As a consequence a lot of players see this game as being vastly inferior to its predecessor. And they would be right. I'll start with what the devs have done (or attempted to do) well. Firstly the devs have done a fairly decent job with the actual interface of the game (i.e. no stupid DayZ backpack shenanigans).  It's as easy as pressing "e" to pick up an item and it won't delete anything if your backpack is full!  It is fairly straightforward and anyone with an IQ above 60 can figure it out in 15 minutes or less. Secondly the devs attempted to cater to a wide audience from the beginning and be more "casual friendly".  One example of this is the "normal" and "hardcore" modes.  In normal mode your character will lose all his gear but won't "die".  In hardcore mode it's permadeath.  As long as you separate the two I see no problems with that.  However in the current gamestate this doesn't happen and there are no benefits to playing on hardcore mode. Lastly once you get to a location to scavenge scavenging is still somewhat fun.  HoweverI think this is in part because of the ease in the user interface and that it is infinitely better than the way DayZ handles it. And now the criticisms; there are a lot. The biggest problem with WarZ is the lack of depth to the map.  In DayZ you normally could find civilization very frequently and find scavengable buildings scattered about.  WarZ feels really 1 dimensional about this.  There are honestly only about 25 to 30 or so major looting locations on the entire map.  What makes this worse is that it is incredibly tedious and boring to move from one location of the map to the next.  When I mean tedious I mean 20 minutes of slow paced walking without any action whatsoever. Problem number 2 is the lack of cooperation communication or interaction between players.  In DayZ you see this interaction frequently between players via "direct communication" from mics.  One major flaw in WarZ is that YOU CANNOT USE A MICROPHONE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANOTHER PLAYER.  This is a major problem that should be addressed quickly as typing is the only means of communication in-game.  On top of that aiming in this game is as simple as COD.  In Arma II it was very difficult to aim and shoot players or zombies.  This game is 100% kill on sight with no communication whatsoever which is frustrating.  For WarZ it feels like a point and click adventure game when shooting players.  This brings me to my next point. You will never realistically shoot zombies in this game when looting by yourself.  Ammo is incredibly rare relative to the number of zombies on the map. I have only shot other players (in self defense mind you) and zombies that were alerted from those shots.  Unfortunately this makes the game even more tedious.  Your primary form of combat in WarZ against zombies will be melee weapons.  There's absolutely no diversity in any of the melee weapons or attacks (other than  damage) so combat is very one-dimensional. There are a multiple of bugs in the game.  In many instances you will fall off rocks and take fall damage without any legitimate warning.  Zombie AI is highly bugged and their pathfinding can be broken by simply jumping on top of a car. Global inventory and the ability to pay for items also ruins the game.  It's frustrating to think that another player can simply buy their items with real world money.  It's not so bad that they can buy guns and completely demolish everyone on the server but enough to "irk" you and piss you off.  It also ruins the idea that you need to "scavenge" for everything you need  Global inventory is an equally bad idea.  It essentially acts as a bank for your characters items that you can deposit in safe zones.  Once a character enters one of these "safe zones" you can equip them with any item found in there INCLUDING items you scavenged from another survivor.  I feel as if this also turns the game from survival into grinding for items. Finally I would like to argue that the devs have done dubious at best at supporting the game.  In the past 2 months I honestly don't think I've seen any significant progression in the game mechanics broken zombie pathfinding or any polishing that has occurred.  Their web pictures are very cherrypicked and are not representative of gameplay in my opinion. WarZ in it's current state at 12/19/12 is truly an unfinished game.  It has some feel of DayZ but it's lacking and not developed.  In particular it lacks the tension that is generated by DayZ because virtually all players will kill on sight.  DayZ from Arma II:CO is more worth your money.,3,Horrible customer service Misleading advertising doesn't live up to expectations. This should be a free to play game.

There's no physics.  Other players kill you for no reason at all.  They could be holding an AK and you could be holding a can of beans or a flashlight.  They're gonna kill you anyway.

One of my friends was gracious enough to give me a 24hr guest past to give the game a test drive. I also never participated in the forums got banned or got pissy over each time I died which was frequent. With that out of the way let's take a look at this game: Well it's glitchy for one. You can drop 6 feetI'll start off by saying I never played DayZ I also never bought this game. One of my friends was gracious enough to give me a 24hr guest past to give the game a test drive. I also never participated in the forums got banned or got pissy over each time I died which was frequent. With that out of the way let's take a look at this game: Well it's glitchy for one. You can drop 6 feet off a roof and take no damage what you can skip a step going down a hill and lose most or all your hp. You quickly learned to never go down a hill without crouching. The zombies only exist by buildings and in the case of big cities may actually go into a building or spawn there. Besides that they almost never go into buildings and can't be found anywhere out in the wilderness which accounts for about 70-80% of the landscape. Zombie AI is also terrible they can hear you walking around through concrete walls and you can crouch-sneak past them from 6 feet away. They mostly just stand around every now and then they'll wander about 15 feet then stop for another undetermined amount of time I've seen them sit around for minutes. They also chase you for miles which I found pretty tedious and they take forever to kill without a gun(I had to hit one 100+ times which took 2-3 minutes). As of this month there are barely any melee weapons to be found and guns are more common than the ammo for them which seems silly to me. Most areas where you can arm up are usually being camped by probably some of the more **** players I've seen in an online shooter. Money is very scarce as well you might find 50 here 100 there but when a basic melee weapon costs 4000+ and you lose it permanently if you die you're kinda stuck with this "Why bother?" mentality. The graphics are...underwhelming. I don't really have anything good to say about them they make it feel like a 2004~ with bad animation. The sound is frustrating because zombies will sound like they're right next to you but really they're 40 feet or further away. The music is also obnoxious playing randomly when it's important for you to be able to hear what's going on around you. There's also no way to turn it off the audio slider cannot be used to mute it. My rating? 1. For obvious reasons detailed. My suggestion? Wait for the DayZ standalone that will likely be quite a bit better than this. People may disagree with me that I only experienced a 24hr pass(About 8 hours spent playing the game) but there really isn't that much content to the game to justify that argument. What your gaming experience will ultimately dwindle down to is finding a off-the-grid town with weapon spawns looting it dry then quitting and loading up another server(preferably low pop) so you have a new instance of the town to loot. Then once you finally have everything join a mid-high pop server kill a few people then die yourself wasting the 30 or so minutes you just spent getting armor weapons healing items and food/water. If what I listed above appeals to you I'm sure you'll enjoy it but I can't in good conscience recommend this game.,0,Terrible game that is nowhere near ready for retail release.Terrible company that threatens its own customers who requested refunds and blatantly lied to their own fan base.,0,A hastily made cash grab attempt to profit off the exploding popularity of the DayZ mod.

The picture I recieved was a hairy man with **** nothing like what I expected to get. The devs never try to explain that Titov's mother is an inbred transvestite. The consumer is lead to believe that they are paying for premium pornography.  The company's business practices are disgusting. DO NOT GET THIS GAME.,0,Fantastic idea ruined by the complete lack of anything that defines a "game". It's simply not playable in this state.

It's not all bad: when my friend and I teamed up to search the city for interesting items and weapons we had a great time defending each other from zombie attack. We found armour backpacks and food and congratulated each other on our fine zombie-killing form. It was good. We were then gunned down by an AK47-wielding player from the bushes for literally no reason. We didn't even have guns. Need more? If you create more than ten characters they do not spawn with anything even a pathetic flashlight. Died? Four hour respawn unless you want to pay REAL MONEY to respawn immediately. It's a terrible PVP game marketed as a groundbreaking zombie apocalypse simulator. Do not buy it. If you have get your refund from Steam.

After the Steam fiasco many people (who were lied to) came here as well to give their obligatory 0's as the game they bought was nothing like the game which was advertised - a fair review considering what they got vs. what they were promised. This game HAD potential to be a great first step in the realm of Zombie MMOs but has since declined into a state of patching minor aspects only to unpatch them and call them optimizations nullify implemented mechanics (pay2res or wait on a  4 hour respawn - an obvious cash-grab) and essentially try to cover a PR disaster of apocalyptic proportions. On top of the fact the lead developer was served with a trademark suspension a month before releasing the game to Steam for sale there now seems to be a lot of speculation of whether or not they will simply change the name or completely cease and desist. I had such high hopes but the development team is less competent than disaster relief in America. Hammerpoint Interactive and Sergey Titov should be legally bound to stop making video games.,0,Obviously this "game" is a scam.

If you like walking down a gentle hill and taking severe damage or jumping off the second floor of a building without taking damage this game is for you.

You do have the option of using a micro-transaction to restore your character to life but that is BS.,1,Normally I blame gamers that buy crappy games for not doing their homework before purchase and therefore generally do not feel sorry for people who complain about a crappy game they bought.

If they ban you from their forums they will ban you from their game too. And here I thought the censorship and moderation with World of Tanks was bad.

It rewards hackers and punishes legit players. Because of this God awful mechanic I give this game a zero.

WarZ establishes itself as a blatant cash grab by charging for an alpha having a cash shop for a buy2play title (in alpha) and rushing a product out before its main competition DayZ releases. I give the game a 1/10 because it has a better UI and character customization than DayZ but fails to innovate or improve upon the survival genre in gunplay melee combat graphics zombie AI tutorials for newbies and cash shop in an alpha-state game that trivializes the survival genre itself. Such as selling vaccines weapons and resurrections for a genre that is defined by surviving to avoid harsh (or permanent) death penalties.

The promises faded into despair as a rather strange patch was released nerfing all the customers with leary respawn times.

You are set in this world to survive and explore. Easier said than done. You will travel this world for many hours find very little in terms of items Infact you will likely run into another survivor a pack of zombies or maybe even a hacker and die before you actually find good gear. Once dead you will have to wait 4 hours before you can play that character again. Unless of course you pay real money. This in it's self is a little shady. Graphically the game is really hit or miss. From afar the scenery and world looks pretty whimsical however once you get a closer look the textures look very awful and out of place. The animations are less than par what they should be. Players and zombies move very statically almost robotic like very inorganic. This ontop of the combat animations which are also terrible make the game look very cheap. Overall my player experience has been very poor due to the lack of content Shady micro transactions Bugs Hackers and much more. I would not recommend this until it has at least fixed the issues stated.,2,I bought the game a month ago.  The Game is almost unplayable.  It's advertised as a Zombie Survival MMO.

What follows is a series of remarks addressed to the readers of this letter and to The War Z itself. I sometimes joke about how moralistic maggots suffer from a collective self-image that prefers victimization to success and imposes a suffocating group conformity that ostracizes nonconformists. But seriously it must be pointed out that I find The War Z's ruinous policies and dubious values unacceptable. Its followers probably don't realize that because it's not mentioned in the funny papers or in the movies. Nevertheless trying to suppress people's instinct and intellect is just as distasteful as trying to subject us to an intense barrage of misinformation deception and hidden propaganda. And I can say that with a clear conscience because from secret-handshake societies meeting at "the usual place" to back-door admissions committees its cultists have always found a way to poke someone's eyes out. If you read The War Z's writings while mentally out of focus you may get the sense that The War Z's plane of understanding is beyond the realm of human imagining. But if you read its writings while mentally in focus and weigh each point carefully it's clear that if it can't stand the heat it should get out of the kitchen. The War Z's faithfuls have learned their scripts well and the rhetoric comes gushing forth with little provocation.

Before I am written off as a Day Z fanboy I have yet to play that specific game. Yes I would like to and I would love to see the genre expand (I wanted this type of genre years ago!) but not this way. This isn't right.

Then they release it for less than $15 without giving anyone who bought in early anything? The game is actually fun to play but not because of the work the developers have put into it.

Since I started playing months ago they've only expanded the map a bit (most of the new places aren't even worth going to anyway) added clans which you have to pay for and thrown on a terrible third person cross-hair.  Oh and they also increased the respawn timer to 4hours while adding a pay to revive feature. Shady.  This company is clearly milking a brilliant concept while putting in little to no effort.  Watching the gong show this game has become is more entertaining than the game itself.,0,Do not purchase this game. Many features listed on Steam are completely missing. The price was reduced to less than $15 in order to squeeze as much money from the game before it dies. I repeat: do not purchase this game you will not get what you think you are getting. Just look at the War Z forums to see the problems,0,The war z is in a state i would describe as nothing more than a glorified alpha. Despite what everyone may say about its current "foundation release" state it has almost no polish and no real features. Beta's at least have some features and in most ways resemble a playable game.

All the old players have a lot of guns and you can't find one since they lower their spawn rate .... Yay ... How do you want to survive on a stupid environnement ruined by stupid developers ?!,0,This game truly sucks ass. If you enjoy working tirelessly for hours upon hours only to have all of your hard work ripped away from you by hackers then this is the game for you.,0,The War Z is a horrible attempt at a cash shop based MMOFPS. You have to wait 4 hours to respawn on death or you can pay with your hard earned cash to revive and possibly die again. Avoid at all costs.,4,This game was rushed and was executed rather sloppily.

In general it's an abusive environment with absolutely no immersive content. It's filled with hackers and players exploiting the under-performing engine. There is absolutely no reason to spend any amount of money on this game and certainly isn't worth the disk-drive space on your PC.,0,Just Don't play it The game is made by guys who don't even care on the players only the money they make.The hole game is glitchy melee combat is dreadful even gun play and walking making me sick.,0,Purchased this while at the pre-order stage and was really eager to play from footage shown.

The game as it stands to me is unfinished... by a long shot realistically there should have been another year of development before even considering releasing it rather than rushing it out and piggybacking off of the success and popularity of day z which it quite clearly is. I would strongly advise avoiding this game the focus I feel has been too much on making a quick buck - rather than concentrating on developing the game and a strong customer base they have shot themselves in the foot by being LAZY and GREEDY.,0,This game is scam EVER!

Like cosmetic items? the game has plenty to bad they go poof the instant you die making it not worth the money you'd be spending for the joy of having the items on for a meer couple minutes before you die and they disapear. like fair admin? well look elsewhere. cause if you kill any of the devs in game you will get permabanned (there is video of it on youtube). The game is basically on par with a bad zynga game. They take the Dayz concept throw up misleading gameplay footage and store information and expect you to wait four hours between each respawn. you want a survival game? get Miasmata or farcry 3. Sure there aren't any zombies but you'll find a more enjoyable experience than this peice of trash.,1,The developers of this game simply wanted to scam as many people as they could by putting bare minimum into this "game". Save yourself some money time and headache and stay away from it.,1,I consider myself to give all games a fair chance to prove themselves. WarZ however has shown that it doesn't deserve this.

It was on sale for $3 so I figured if I tried it out I wouldn't lose much.  Well I lost my self respect.  Terrible graphics terrible pay2win scheme  constant hacking and server issues.  This game is not worth it at any price.,0,I've never wanted a dev to fail but I hope these guys crash and burn and I hope someone takes them to task for lying about the game....Steam should be ashamed for letting this be sold on their service.....I won't be supporting These devs or Steam at all after this.,1,Poor unfinished cash in game wait for DayZ standalone the media that come from this game are fake and false advertising.

Atmosphere - Sound design gives you some fairly eerie sound effects especially at night.Player Interaction - To a small extent Id say. You don't know anyone's name (does not show up) and they could be anyone. Tense but forcefully so. Leads to some funny encounters but accidentally.UI - Its.... OK. A bit better than serviceable.Bugginess - A bit of a stupid positive but it really is a little fun to jump in a bin and be totally immune. Not a reason to buy the game obviously... The game fails in:Density - There is nothing in this game. Nothing to do. You either find guns or people kill you first.Graphics - HORRIBLE. Low-resolution textures coupled with horrible meshes and the WORST particles/post processing I have ever seen. The screenshots are fake and do not represent the game. I cannot stress enough that you should not buy this game because of the graphic fidelity in does NOT HAVE. Feels retro its so bad.Gun play - Fairly shoddy - nothing good going on here. Low budget gun play - no noticeable effect on enemy no real feedback from guns.Movement and Controls - Again shoddy. Clunky and it feels like your riding a horse.Survival - Its there but it doesn't really matter. No real consequence.Lack of Features - The majority of promised features are not in the game. Especially cars/strongholds/player caps/different worlds/just about everything. Also most game assets are copied from War Inc. their previous game.Sound - Jumpy and everything seems to be a different volume. Fair ****Anti Cheat - Doesn't "really" work. Lots of cheaters.Bandits - Wow. Its a dog eat dog world. While you may enjoy wanting to kill survivors it gets overbearing  and indiscriminate considering guns kill you in about 2 shots.Restrictions - Very boxed in. Cant swim even though lakes are everywhere - prepare to go around.Alpha Bugs - they say its releasable but it really is still in alpha. Horrible crashes disconnects and bugs all round. I'm really struggling to find positives about the game but I tried. With a bit of weighing up. I would give the game 2/10 but the developer management of the community forces it down to a 1 - they truly are just horrible. Id recommend you sit this one out and look elsewhere. I hate to be that guy but DayZ is really shaping up - Id check it out if you have not already.,0,I want my money back.Bought it on steam assuming it was a complete game. Played it for 20 minutes or so before I died where I was then told I could resurrect if I paid extra!?Jesus people. Don't buy this.,0,What a travesty of a game.

The game often made me die unfairly by characters with textures not completely done hackers which exploited the game and killed me from a humongous distance and the zombies by the faulty and horrible concept of the combat system. The textures are very horrible and looks like it took them 3 months to make this game. If you watch TheTotalBiscuit's 'The Bore Z' you have a good knowledge of what it is about the most unforgiving parts of this game is that many of us were lied to by the developers lying to us about the features of this game and secondly if you buy items with your currency that you used for real life once you die all the items that you bought have been washed down the drain as you are not getting them back. I am glad it got all the controversy it has as it is a messed up game which needs HEAVY improvements. Thankfully I bought it on Steam and got a refund for it that is the only good thing but other than that stay away from this game as the scariest part of it is buying the game and playing it.,1,What the **** is wrong with this game!

And why wouldn't  he shoot you? There are no consequences just your loot and no one to betray him. And that's what Day z does but Day z is up front with it no BS. Also they said no pay to play ammo armor food and mods would only be find able or buy able with the currency you can find in game. As soon as the game came out of alpha that changed now its almost exclusively money based. Which I would be fine with if it were worth it and they had been honest. Day z is a mod and is so much better than The War Z. This game is pointless and I hope Hammerpoint tanks over this travesty.,1,This game is not even worth writing a review.

The WarZ is by far the most blatant scam that I have ever seen submitted to Steam. With certain aspects of the games design being clearly stolen from other products the name designed to cause confusion between it and DayZ the Terms of Service update to remove the possibility of a refund (against European Law I might add) the blatant censorship that has occurred within the community of the game and most importantly purposely banning users that have a significant amount of playtime to try and make them buy the game a second time this is an absolutely appalling product that should not be bought under any circumstances. When even the developers of the game as seen in their thread (http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79039-War-Z-on-metacritic-tell-us-what-do-you-think-!) are trying to submit positive reviews to influence the user score you know something is very badly wrong. The clarity with which the scam is truly clear is at such an astoundingly high level that even the details on the product description are false advertising (and despite the developers comments there is very literally no way to interpret them as anything but what they have stated). It truly is saddening to see that this is the Top Seller on Steam at the moment and a refund is in order for all who foolishly bought this on impulse thinking it was DayZ (which is an unfortunately understandable situation). If you're going to spend any money on The WarZ it should be suing the developers for the clear scam they have released on Steam it is absolutely not worth a purchase.,0,This game is a scam and it sucks. They devs lied. Do not buy this game. Save your money. The game still has areas that are in alpha. I bought the game based on the Steam description. Then they changed it. This is not what I paid for. This game is bad.,0,Slimy developer that rips off customers by decieving them and outright lying to their faces. This game is a cash-grab ripoff copy of Day Z with "pay to play" garbage added to it and needs to go die in a hole.,0,A huge scam.

However as far as the developers are concerned (according to interviews) this is what the finished game should be and everything else added from now on is just icing on the cake. It doesn't help that the game is filled with hackers bugs glitches and a lack of trained customer service support (I don't think I've talked to any forum moderators or support members that can actually spell or write in proper sentences). You can make a new character spawn into the game and once loaded already be dead (no spawn protection). Micro-transactions are pay-to-win; I'm not talking about cosmetic stuff but the more money you put into the game the more of an advantage you get. Example: the respawn timer after you were killed used to be 1-hour long but post-'release' the timer was increased to 4-hours with the ability to pay 50 cash credits (bought with real money) to respawn instantly. This game is and feels unfinished and lacks polish. However they are currently advertising it as a foundation-level experience. No friends list no promised skill-tree no actual customer support no deterrant for hackers (i.e. no anti-cheat system) constant lag on servers with more than 15 players arbitrary bannings of players (especially if you're vocal about not liking some aspect of the game you've just purchased). Seems like a pretty weak foundation.,0,Ok Lets start with the Developer of this game.

Also his little Sergay known as Kewk will ban you on the forums if you say anything negative about War Z and also just started banning on the steam forums. As for the game it can be fun with friends as long as you do not pay attention to the **** animations and flat textures! WTF it's going to be 2013 and if your a development team that can not make great animations and optimize a game to work well with high end graphics card and have no talent in a mmo which it is not even close to a mmo its just a open world with hours of roaming empty wilderness with closed buildings that look like people obviously took the furniture when the Virus broke out from the few homes you can enter. The game is just plain **** unless you play with other friends who bag on it while you play but then hackers come and wipe out your team because yes the game has hackers everywhere!! The worse hacking I have seen in a game in a long time! Just save your money and DO NOT BUY!!!!,0,Do not I repeat DO NOT buy this game. 15 dollars may seem cheap but that's a lot to pay for garbage. The game is quite clearly still unfinished and the description on the steam page is filled with outright lies.

I suppose this wouldn't be so bad if the game were good as is but surprise surprise it isn't. I was absolutely bored to tears withing the first 50 minutes or so of booting it up. I saw more players than zombies and even if one happened to cross my path fighting it consisted of hitting it with a flashlight 20 times looking at the same animation over and over again. The only thing I had to survive from in this game was boredom and I soon started to pray that the zombies would swarm me and the sweet embrace of death would release me from this hell. Now normally graphics aren't a defining factor weather a game is good or not but dear lord if your textures look like that mush in a jar that babies eat it tells a lot about a game. Also I will add that most of the models are ripped straight from their other game War Inc including a few animations. Now despite your 15 dollars going straight into Sergey's bank account he also wants to give you the gift of micro-transactions! Of course this wouldn't be so bad right? It's some cosmetic stuff and you can buy weapons without having to find them. Well if you die you lose all the weapons you paid for with real money. If that doesn't say "I care about the money screw you." I don't know what does. You could at least have the courtesy to make the game free and be a bit truthful yeah? Also one of the people that worked on this worked on Big Rigs.Big.Rigs. Overall 9/10 would play again.,0,Zbanowali mojego kolege permanentnie za niby haki na steamie klamia ze juz sa rzeczy ktorych nie wprowadzono na postac juz trzeba 4 godziny czekac na odrodznie albo trzeba zaplacic ! zlodzieje !!!,0,This is why gamers can't have nice things.

I'm a fan of the zombie survival genre but this game simply fails when held up to scrutiny.  The many flaws takes away from any enjoyment the genre might give.,1,The first night they launched the Alpha version for us to play it was obvious the game wasn't in devolpment for anything short of a few months days could of even been argued.

The game was just simply unplayable and obvious not being tested that much by the Devs before they released it to us. Problems like zombies not dying and flashlights being one hit kills things you would of noticed had you actually tested the game at all before releasing anything. But then it got slightly better some things changed here and there and it was playable. And i actually started enjoying myself playing with my squad and hoarding stuff. But then came the hackers making the game almost completely unplayable. You can't go an hour without encountering some **** shooting through walls or aimbotting. And YES it is that obvious when i get killed and see him looking through walls right where the rest of my squad is. Now hackers may be hit and miss for some people but it's to the point for me where whenever me and my squad go into Smallville or Clearview to secure the town and loot it we are getting shotgun sniped or have a guy flying through walls. I see a lot of people on the forums saying that people are just calling out good players for cheating but there is a huge difference in getting outplayed and seeing someone looking through walls and flying around. Also in the last ban wave they unbanned a bunch of people because they cried enough on the forums that they were innocent. So basically they are admitting that the anti-cheat doesn't work worth a **** and can throw false positives when detecting cheats.,3,WarZ was a game of great promise but the continued unprofessional attitude of the developers and forum moderators have tarnished a good chunk of that.

There is no reason that the developer should have released the game in it's current state.  I wish I would have read all the drama surrounding this game before I wasted my money.

Why is it called MMO? Is Arma2 also a MMO? Is Battlefield also a MMO? Its ONE small map for 50 Player. Thats all. This game is never a MMO and it wont be a MMO anytime. Then the Story about the Mod that told the story that they want to cut the service if it doenst work out well. Yeah he took his story back and is now again best friend with the Producers. Hey i would to...if the only other way had been getting a law suit. Sure that he takes everything back. To make it short. The most things it advertises are false! This game isnt even an alpha yet. Yeah mabye it calls itself different but it simply isnt more. It is ONE!

Maybe it changed till then to the better but I would bet that the Community is dead by then or the Game put offline.,1,I bought this game thinking it would be great judging from the game pictures they have on the site and how many people loved the arma 2 mod DayZ.

So as you can imagine after respawning your luck doesn't change much. All in all i guess this is more of a game community review since i couldn't get far enough from my spawn to actually play much of the game AT ALL. I give this game a 1 just for the concept of a zombie mmo. But the community pvp and lack of a "spawn protection period" or a "new player protection period"  makes this game literally unplayable,1,So I downloaded it from Steam on Monday thinking everything I saw listed as a feature would you know actually be there. Well they weren't.

While your main focus should be to avoid the zombies and surviving the flesh-eating monsters the in-game experience teaches you that zombies are no threat at all and the only thing you should look out for are other survivors who are going to shoot you for your bottle of water.

However many positive community-driven changes were pushed out in the days to come and many of us were convinced that should Hammerpoint maintain its steady stream of attentive updates there was simply no way The War Z could go wrong in development. As it turns out the game rather quickly became stagnant: new features were not released; what small portions of the map were opened up were generally poorly textured uninteresting and just a bit of the same ol' same ol'; there was a lot of rumbling about community censorship and refunds going around and the general atmosphere of The War Z became very hostile. Having been with the game since day one of the alpha I can tell you this: what The War Z boils down to is a very shady Russian man - the mind behind Big Rigs perhaps the most horrific game ever made to date - who may or may not be committing a very sophisticated game-oriented adaptation of the pump-and-dump stock fraud method. At the end of the day you're better off investing in a copy of ArmA II and DayZ or waiting for DayZ's standalone. To be frank I've seen drug deals a shade more legit than this game has turned out to be.,1,Money Grabbers!

It is also not mentioned that this game is in a very unfinished state. The game itself is still bad and the ability to buy  the best items with real money remains. The game is still the horrible cash grab it was before but it seems that the developers work less and less on the game and they might even abandon the project after there is no more money to squeeze out of the pockets of kids who want the "real" experience.,0,Puts so many great ideas from dayz and other games into one place but without any sense of balance.

You find a few different types of pistols and rifles often but never mags for these weapons. So most the weight/space in your pack are just 7-10 bullet guns that you end up tossing on the ground. Food and water seem abundant in most areas as well. As well the zombies seem to do some weird congregation into these sometimes large clusters of 3-15 zombies standing all on top of each other. The zombies have no AI at all and just go to the nearest person to them. Aggro radius of weapons and sound do not seem to match up and many people would agree the newly added skill tree doesn't even seem to add the benefits to the character. Also the game is ripped off of the well known Dayz mod. Everything they claimed on the steam page (the first go) is not "yet" implemented into the game. You are NOT able to sell items to vendors you are NOT able to spawn in high population servers without getting aimbot killed or some kind of hack killed 70-80% of the good items cost REAL MONEY to get the other items cost an absurd amount of in-game money to purchase. There is only 1 map maybe about 90-100km2 and no transportation other than walking so trips start taking hours depending on where you start on the map (assuming you do not get killed by another player instantly). There are only 2 buildings in each settlement even in use currently; the vault where you store items and gear and the vendor for purchasing ammo and other useful items. You are NOT able to leave notes for players other than with time capsules which cost REAL MONEY to obtain or you may get lucky enough to find one. The Steam page does NOT mention the game is in so called beta stage (when in my opinion the game is so broken it should be alpha if anything). You glitch through buildings often hoping up on top of the roof or just falling straight through dieing. All in all with all the broken mechanics of the game the shotty graphics that still seem to eat up all your computers resources and the pay-to-win item mall I would say stay away from this game if at all possible or get buddy buddy with someone and a private server. In all honesty with all the blatant lies and all the false advertising I'm surprised the customer base hasn't started a class action suit against them (or what ever it would be called lol I'm no lawyer). For this I give them a 0/10 but the game concept would be awesome with a competent company behind it.,0,this game is a piece of crap go buy amra 2 or 3 there better than this ecspalialy with the dayz mod this is a rip off of dayz but dayz is free so f this game,0,This game is unbelieveable so many bugs and glitches zombies sound like dogs anyone you see kills you takes hours and hours just to get to an area.

Its one and only  redeeming quality is its concept. There is little question that idea of an open world zombie apocalypse shooter has merit.  If you don't believe me just look at the adoption for War Z and the emerging competitors like 7 days to die Rust etc.  The problem is that the game is so poorly implemented that anyone familiar with the industry has to question either Hammerpoint's technical competency or intentions (if not both).  This game has been in "production" for over a year and it still lacks core functions advertised during pre-release.  To make matters worse for a product that should be on the upper end of the maturity curve (for the gaming industry) it still features a host of very serious bugs that should not have even been tolerated at their "Go-No Go" meeting. The best part?  It is not getting better.  I have never seen a development team that with each new fix introduces such rampant breaks to other parts of the game.  Does Hammerpoint even perform user acceptance testing? Gamers avoid this dog pile at all costs! Note to Hammerpoint:  Fire your modellers animators terrain mappers and engine development team.

So you ought to not expect much from this team but it gets worse since they constantly lie to boost sales by lying about what is actually in the game what can we expect how long they have been working on it etc. This game is an obvious cash grab on dayZ's success which is why he made all these false claims and promises prior release and charged several times the retail price for the game during it's alpha stage. If you think that you will cease to spend money once you purchased the game you are sadly mistaken. This guy is trying to squeeze as much money from their suckers as they can. They wanted to charge 750 in game currency to create a clan. They later changed this after community outrage. Currently they are charging you 50GC to respawn your character. If you don't pay this fee you will have to wait 4 hours to use your character again. The gameplay: This game fails at everything it tries to be. This game is supposed to be an open world survival mmo with zombies but at best only manages to capture the PVP aspect of dayZ. This game survival implementation lacks any depth to it. It is reduced to just finding food and water which are fairly common. You eat food instantly so you do not have to be off guard to eat and same for healing yourself scavenging and switching weapons. This game is missing many animations that you would expect and the ones that exists are god awful. This game doesn't have the fun of setting up a camp site to store items or make your base. The zombie AI is way to simplistic especially for a game that suppose to have harder zombies. Stealth in this game is poorly implemented. This game is suppose to appeal to hardcore gamers but has many carebare features. Like safezones and global inventory. Stuff like this takes away from the survival aspect and the genre is general. This game is horrible and I would not recommend it to anyone.,0,I don't need to write a review because you can just read all the others saying how bad this game is but to reiterate the point and reach the 150 characters quota the people who made this game are just cashing in on dayz.,1,A lot of lies zero communication between costumer and developer.

DO NOT BUY IT. The forums are like a damn gulag. DON'T BUY THIS GAME.,0,This game is absolutely horrible. Horrible textures horrible animations horrible map horrible physics and on top of it all pay to win. It is also filled with hackers and glitchers.,1,These developers should straighten up and do their work properly. This is a GREAT concept being drained down the toilet. I really hope some real people will start thinking about a game like this maybe they will manage not to screw things up.,0,This game is a bait and switch where the customer is the mark. Hammerpoint sells their games as if it was a feature-complete game while it is for all practical purposes in alpha-stage. That is quite apart from the blatant lies in the marketing (still present on the WarZ homepage nevermind the Steam store page) and the ludicrous claim that it is an "MMO".,0,This game is essentially the story of the mad king. But first we need to understand the background of the company. The entire games history is half truths and down right lies.

According to their forum rules you must not "Steal Copywrited Work" unfortunately this doesn't seem to apply to them. Not only did they STEAL League of Legends ToS - the best part is they left the link of league of legends inside the terms of service for War Z. Then their great zombie logo is actually stolen screen grabs from the t.v show The Walking Dead photoshoped. Oh but lets get onto the game. The War Z is actually just a Mod of War Inc.. A Free 2 Play game owned  by the parent company Hammer Point.  Essentially what they tried to do is the reverse of DayZ. In DayZ's case  they used most of the models and gameplay concepts from ARMA 2 and released a mod with a few changes. In WarZ's case it was almost the opposite. You are actually paying for the Mod. They used alot of the assets and same engine from War Inc. changed a few things around and made you pay for the mod Instead. Essentially if you played War Inch add a bunch of zombies and shoot an you got War Z. Now onto the business side of War Z. War Z has a great reputation for banning dissenters. You say anything bad anywhere your account gets banned - no reason given. Essentially its like a mad king killing those who oppose him. Not only that this king blames his subjects for "mis-reading" his words instead of manning up saying he didn't correctly explain the product description. So if you want to support a company that steals other products blames its customers bans accounts without reason. Support War Z. Otherwise Down with the King.,2,This game has potential but development is VERY slow features that they claimed were already in the game that got us to buy it in the first place are not even in the game yet.

I hoped it would get better but this  is an outright money grab and bail,0,If you click the TOS no refunds. AKA fraud AKA these motherfuc*ers are breaking the law with their TOS. GG WarZ devs GG.

Blatant cash grab move and this after advertising "no hidden fees no paid DLC" etc.* Speaking of no paid DLC items you purchased with real money are lost when you die meaning you have to re-purchase them.* Game advertised up to 100 players multiple areas with maps (plural) ranging from 100-400 square km and spending experience/skill points to upgrade skills.  Buyers of the game learned that it came with one single map with only approximately 73 square km playable (the rest was locked) capped at a maximum of 50 players rather than 100 and no hint of skill points or skill upgrades.* When challenged about claims and releasing a game that was effectively a beta that was nowhere near done or ready the developer claimed that the game was fully out of beta stage but would never be "finished" because online games are always evolving.  This in the face of a clear message in the version released on Steam that stated "ALPHA TEST FUNCTIONALITY SUBJECT TO CHANGE."* Developers have reportedly randomly banned players through the use of "lure" items that will trigger its automatic anti-hack system permanently banning game accounts of those players.  Complaints on the developer forum about unethical bans like this are ignored or deleted. This developer is also the genius behind "Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing."  If he was not notorious for releasing shoddy barely finished junk to the public and trying to scrape cash in while doing the absolute bare minimum and never actually providing a working final product he should be now.  He insults you for "misunderstanding" his lies makes lots of claims that are not true lifts most of his work from previous projects (some that aren't even his own) and is in just about every way a perfect example of what NOT to do as a game developer. This game is absolutely not worth your money.  Check the official forums or do some Google searching if you question any of this.,2,Heard how bad it was going to be but wanted to try it anyways. The game is fun with friends to just hop right in and try to find each other in a post-apocalyptic world while avoiding hordes of zombies (barely) and sly bandits who are out there trying to take your supplies by killing you.

It was fun before the 4-hour patch to just jump in survive die and repeat. But after the 4-hour re-spawn timer if you delete a character (Why is there even a re-spawn timer anyways? If you die you die.) and create a new one you get nothing. Not even food or a flashlight. Seriously? You join a server and spawn in the middle of the damn forest with NO FLASHLIGHT?! On top of that even to survive just to find food would be impossible without some type of defense. All I can say is this game had a TON of potential. Probably the only reason I bought it. While it was play-able after the 4-hour re-spawn patch/update it's pretty much unplayable. To buy or not to buy? It was a buy game but not anymore. I even had three of my friends get it because it was quite enjoyable in the beginning but now we are all getting our refunds.,0,This game has continued to disappoint those who were looking for a DayZ clone and those who simply wanted another zombie game.

Nothing has been added to it since it was released yet the company making it claims that they have already gone through alpha and beta and the game is now released. They sell the game based on lies false promises and doctored screenshots which show impossible in game situations and features that simply do not exist. Almost none of the features the company lists and being in game currently actually appear. When they first put the game on Steam they claimed to have multiple maps and hundred player servers and even these simple basic game elements they were lying about.  Even after having to edit their Steam page to better reflect how the game actually is they just put up another list of features that aren't actually in the game and then lied about the map size and players per server some more. The entire game is just a poorly executed mod for the companies other FREE 2 PLAY game War Inc: Battlezones. The only difference being the UI and that there are now zombies (which have horribly broken AI and don't even perform as shown in screenshots). That is it other than that you are just getting a failed Free2Play shooter on a different map (a map which is much closer to 10 square kilometers than the 100 the company tries to claim it is). This game has now been removed from being purchasable on Steam and Valve even went so far as to post a public apology for even placing this game in the store in the first place with all of its false advertisements and the fact that it is nowhere even close to being a finished product. The screenshots that they use to advertise their game and claim is actual in game footage shows multiple features that the company hasn't even started working on yet. They also show tons more zombies than actually appear in the game. They recently tried to up the zombie count (even still it is nowhere near what we see in their screenshots) and all they managed to do is cause every single person even those running top of the line machines to get a severe drop in performance. The same day that the released the game on Steam they also made it so that when you die in the game you have to wait 4 hours to respawn. That is unless you visit their cash shop and purchase the new insta-revive which was also added the day it went one Steam. This is the definition of Pay2Win. This game expects you to not only buy the game which is simply a mod for a Free2Play game by the same company but then in addition to this they run a cash shop filled with almost every item in the game (for instance you can buy 100round drum mag NATO rounds which are used in about 8 different not even rare guns in the game). They also expect players to pay for additional clan slots if you want more than 4 people including yourself in the clan. You will also be renting the game servers when they decide to start letting people do that. I gave this game a 0/10 because it is not even a game it is a poorly executed modification for a failed free FPS and is being sold on nothing more than a pack of lies and doctored screenshots. How this game hasn't been sued yet for false advertising is beyond me and I bet it is just a matter of time.,0,This game is a scam. Spent hard earned cash on it and it really hurts knowing that Titov the scumbag is making off with it now. Don't care about the merits of the game-- it was blatantly false advertising.,0,I have been banned from the "community forum" for voicing my concerns about the game.

The recent revelations of all the shady Dev actions the permabans the blatant lying about the games release featuresetc...all that factors into my decision to not rate higher but I'm trying to be objective about the game itself. The best part of the game is the tension.  But the tension doesn't come from inside the game...it comes from the other players.  The zombies are easy to evade and easy to kill.  Its the other players you have to watch out for.  Rarely EVER did I find other players that didn't try to kill me.  If you see someone you can assume they are going to kill you for your loot...or just to grief you.  It makes this game into nothing more than an open world PvP game...so if you are into that great.   But if you think there is any PvE in here...go elsewhere because that feature disappeared within hours of the Alpha release. Overall I simply cannot recommend this game.  The cheating is out of control there are no PvE servers the maps are too small for 50-100 players unless you are really into PvP.  The recent actions of the Dev's have really illustrated their underlying shadiness and really I doubt the game will be around for more than 6 months.,0,dirty tactics scamming micro-transactions in pre-payed game acting as refund is a fraud... The game itself would be OK (4/10) as a free to play but now it's a complete garbage with terrible studio behind.,0,Seriously don't buy this game.

Also I can jump off a Humvee without getting hurt but walking down a slight incline sometimes hurts me. There are many other issues but I think everyone covered those just fine. The initial rate of purchase from Steam shows that a game with this concept would perform well financially. However as of Dec 19 2012 this is not an enjoyable game as is.

Remember his name just in case you meet him some day.,0,What was Sergey even thinking when he tried to cover up his lies with lies saying the users can't read and calling campers **** This game should not be played at all ever stay away.,0,I bought this game and have regretted it since. I was annoyed when the vehicles weren't there. I was aggravated when they changed the respawn timer to 4 hours for a game that I had paid for. The hackers are absolutely ridiculous and the anti-cheat system is garbage. But the thing that ticked me off the most was the way the staff handled the criticism and are so blindsided as to blameI bought this game and have regretted it since.

But the thing that ticked me off the most was the way the staff handled the criticism and are so blindsided as to blame everyone but themselves. I understand that this game is a work in progress but they blatantly lied about many things. I asked for a refund since I purchased directly from their website but have yet to hear any response. Do not buy.,0,Bought the game right when it came out and said to myself that it is alpha. Then when beta came and I saw what the hell this a beta it sucks. All they did was fix the bugs but the game is so stiff. The animation are so horrible in every way. Thought it was going to improve since I thought those were just place holders until beta comes out.

I believe everything is said in the other reviews!: The devs are liars and make false advertisment- People did not get the game they were told they would get. Then they ban random people especially people who try to give some constructive criticism.... Mark my words they really don't tolerate any kind of criticism! Then there is the game...First of all I did not getWhat shall I say? I believe everything is said in the other reviews!: The devs are liars and make false advertisment- People did not get the game they were told they would get. Then they ban random people especially people who try to give some constructive criticism.... Mark my words they really don't tolerate any kind of criticism! Then there is the game...First of all I did not get what i was promised! Because the features listet on steam wasn't implemented in the game! ... I'm actually pretty disappointed that steam agree to sell such games.. That's not okay! The game itself is pretty boring- and very frustrating to play. It is boring because it features NOTHING. You can drink eat and run- But that's it. You can't interact with anything. There is no doors to be opened or closed no objects except of food to carry or move around... You can't even use your fists. This is very bad because after you die the first time you will respawn with absolutely nothing which means you can't do anything but run if encountered by zombies/bandits. You got a stamina which means you can run a limited distance and then you have to stop breath and "reload" your stamina.... Nothing wrong with that it adds a realistic feeling to the game.... but it causes some problems because it happens that you can not run from the zombies and because you can't beat them or do anything to hit/damage them you die- And you'll have to wait 4 hours to respawn unless you have plenty of (real)money- then you can buy a "quick revive".Then comes the problem with cheats and hackers- There are MANY of them(hackers) and many of them are camping at the spawningspots the cities and the safezones which means that you'll suffer a quick dead after you have been waiting for 4 long hours to be able to play again.... It is REALLY hard to get any kind of weapon- Even melee weapons such as hammers and bats are in very short supply- And you need to sneak past hackers with wallhack and aimbots just to be able to look after them... You can't host private servers which means: You can't avoid the many hackers. The graphics aren't anything you would brag about... and the sound  (of guns zombies and characters) is pretty lame.... The idea was good... But because of some greedy harsh developers they game is ruined- And I have no faith that it will change. Now I'll just sit and hope someone else will pick up the idea where the developers lost it!!!,0,A terrible game. Almost nothing like what was promised. Even now what is said to be in the game (100 km map) isn't even true. There is no way the map is 100 km. Probably 1/5 that or less.,0,Shockingly bad avoid. For the game itself it is riddled with hackers glitches bugs. Combine that with poor graphics and animation and the fact that it runs so badly there is really nothing positive to say about it.,0,Purchased this game after Oct 31 2012. As they stated they will be in the beta stage of the game. Game has absolutely no hope - they accepted purchases before the game was even alpha stage. Rushed the game - garbage game - don't you dare buy it. This game has no hope it's a scam and a money grabber due to the success of Day Z....,0,Rushed game animations are horrible the sound of guns and environment are horrible and buggy. Zombies' AI is horribly bad. Nobody should purchase this game..,0,This isn't so much a game as a list of features that don't exist in the final product.  To call The War Z a scam would be generous.

You will want to wait until Day Z comes out worst purchase of my life.,0,I give it a score of 0 because I was a huge fan of it at a early stage but as most of the people say - they can't hold the smallest promise.

I can't believe I paid 30 dollars for this game...,0,This game is nothing but a desperate attempt to make some money out of the "Day Z fever" with a bad port from War Inc which is a pretty horrible game by itself.It is by far the worst game that has ever landed on Steam thank god Steam soon realised and removed it.DO NOT BUY this garbage.,0,Terrible graphics and gameplay all packed into a small map that's not even nearly as big as advertised (it's only about ~10KM2 playable.)

I think the only thing it really has going for it is a better UI compared to 'that other' zombie mod.  Full of cheaters.  Sparsely populated with braindead zombies with terrible AI and animations where they don't quite 'shamble' and don't quite 'run' it's almost like a half jog and they come at you in a perfectly straight line which looks terrible when you've got a group of them after you. You can't swim for some reason instead only being able to go into the water about waist deep or so. I say terrible graphics simply because the game is full of low-poly trees and foliage topped off with low-res textures.  It doesn't matter how much post-processing effects they add like HDR DoF sun-shafts lens flare bump-mapping...you can't polish a turn.  Low-res textures look like crap.  Low-res textures covered up with all these extra effects looks like shiny crap.  And the color palette is a bit odd mostly because everything has that 'overexposed' vivid almost cartoony colors.  I think it's an attempt to help the landscape look impressive which admittedly sometimes the view you have of nature looks good but most of the time it just doesn't work. Then there's all the BS surrounding the devs.  They're a bunch of lying pricks who change their story and accuse their fans of 'misreading' the features listed on the Steam launch.  Terribly unprofessional and one has to wonder just how old some of these guys are. Then an ex-mod comes out and makes all these claims which he later retracted once he got his job back.  The thing that smells fishy to me is that if you had a guy lying and spreading terrible rumors about your company you don't just give him his job back if he agrees to shut his mouth by saying he was lying.  You do that if he was telling the truth and just want to shut him up so you agree to give him a piece of the pie. The apologists are funny as hell too.  A lot will say "Yeah the devs are a bunch of lying a$$holes and douches but I still kinda like the game so you shouldn't be hating on the game so much."  That's like saying "Yeah the devs punch babies and drown kittens but I still like the game so I want to be able to buy it on Steam again."  It's no wonder society has issues.  First world problems where morals don't matter as long as you get your video game and Big Mac right? Just my two cents.,0,Obvious cash grab trying to capitalize on the success of DayZ... The devs have demonstrated on several occasions how little they care about their users. All they're interested in is money.,0,This is a horrible game full of lies.

New players are thrown into the game with nothing and are constantly just cattle for the few players who managed to accumulate weapons and ammo early on. The weapon drops are so rare that it's just a lottery draw if you'll be able to survive long enough to find one.My main criticism of the game is that it's unbalanced to the point of being unplayable except for a few minutes at a time. New players are thrown into the game with nothing and are constantly just cattle for the few players who managed to accumulate weapons and ammo early on. The weapon drops are so rare that it's just a lottery draw if you'll be able to survive long enough to find one. There is no PVE option for those who prefer it and servers aren't scaled to the power of the players. So it may be fun for those few with a bully mentality who get no bigger thrill than ganking much weaker players but without a mechanism to allow beginners a fair chance to come up to par the game will just hemorrhage players until it isn't even worth playing for the handful of fanatics who are left. By the way what makes it a pain to advance is that when another player kills you you lose everything you had on you and start back at square one. This leaves only two possible strategies: team up with large groups which not everyone is interested in doing or doing very short scavenging runs and bring everything back to your global inventory (which you keep even when you die) and hope to slowly build up enough equipment to survive. That's a job not a game. All the technical problems are secondary to the fact that there's no game balance. Even if it were technically perfect it would still not be a pleasant experience. The only hope for this game's survival is either a PVE mode (which not everyone wants) or ranked servers. On the plus side the mood of the game is good mostly due to an excellent soundtrack.,0,Purchased this game on steam....  Really not much to say other than It was a very poor experience.

Charging for microtransactions on top of charging for a broken buggy "game" is nothing short of criminal which the rest of the practices the devs employ also are (copying ToS from other games forcing users to agree to new ToS at random signing away rights (very illegal) bumping up the spawn time from 1 hour to 4 hours and then instilling a monetary charge to revive).  It's a cruel joke and I'm grieved to think some people were actually suckered in by this. HOW IS THERE NOT ALREADY A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THESE PEOPLE?,0,For starters it is the same group of people which created the ARMAII Mod Day Z. Secondly they clearly said on their site that it is pre-beta stage (Compared to Day Z which is in pre-alpha stage.)

VALVe has since removed it from being purchased on STEAM since they lied and said it was a finished product which they later found out it wasn't. Might of been a good sell but it's multiplier only. Got a full refund though.,1,Even if you ignore the game's quality for a moment there's one thing that you should know before you purchase the game - They recently added a line in their TOS stating that you could not purchase a refund if you accepted and you had to accept to play. They also claim that the game has been in development for years yet Hammerpoint Interactive was created specifically for The War Z andEven if you ignore the game's quality for a moment there's one thing that you should know before you purchase the game - They recently added a line in their TOS stating that you could not purchase a refund if you accepted and you had to accept to play. They also claim that the game has been in development for years yet Hammerpoint Interactive was created specifically for The War Z and has no other games. Not only that but Sergey Titov said in May 2012 that they would soon invite War Inc players to participate in an alpha test and that they started conceptualizing the game a few weeks ago. This means that the game was not in development for years before as they claim. Since they released it in such a buggy and clearly unfinished state to make it look like progress was being made when it clearly was nowhere near ready for the open market it could technically qualify as vaporware - meaning that they started announced and released the game before it was anywhere near ready and falsely claimed that they had worked on it for "years" to try and legitimize it. This is illegal in the United States under the Sherman Antitrust Agreement. Adding the line in the TOS about not getting a refund is illegal as well. Since Hammerpoint is a United States company they're technically breaking the law. For those of you considering purchasing the game you now know what you're getting into.,2,This game WAS aswome crazy at alpha and bigining of beta.

I bought it first week of allpha launch and clearly enjoyed. From this date to yesterday I passed almost all my free time on it.... but at steam release time Hammerpoint totally broke it bad. Let me explain... One point is that you own 5 charactere slots and you have to know that when one of your char die ingame it lose all ths stuff he was carrying and was unable to revive for 1 hour. At steam relaase hammerpoint passed this revival time from 1 hour to 4 hours with the possibility to instant revive with a real money cost option. That means the poeple you are killing can instant repop close to your position and with a full stuff dropped at revive from general inventory. On the other hand if YOU die and if you want for example continue to play with a group of friend you were playing with hammerpoint force you to spend real cash to. What seems like some betrayal cause Hammerpoint promised that The WarZ would be a game you buy and you wouldn t have to pay additive cost to play... Of course there is a marketplace but mostly for cosmmetics item (recently all scopes switched to ingame cash to real cash which isn t very fair same problem). My conclusion ?? The War Z is globally  an awsome entertainment but the recent change of way from Hammerpoint just turned it into a Pay to Play beta game. Let's hope it would change in near future but for the moment I can"t rate it good because of it. (my appologise for my bad english but I think every feeling about this soft have to be say cause it s a real good beta game with a real potential for entertainment but those recent changements totally deserve it),0,So bad the game could be fun but it has so many bug and flaws it hat so many hacks that is hard not to find one. This game could be fun if they made it right. But as right now it just suck...,0,This game gave me cancerous hemorrhoids... Sort of saddens me that STEAM released this game on their platform...

(http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/07/WarZNight32.jpg) remember huh? .... but i didnt bought this game obviously. I bought this Game (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKAm3nzg6I) I personally stopped playing after the first 3 Weeks beacause no evident game Change came up. Also the Hacker took the Wrath of God onto every Server and you can see every Day people complaining about getting killed by hacker esp botter etc. the shady behavior of the Dev Team and their Forum Mods is the wrong way. they constantly deleting EVERY negative Thread posted on the official and the Steam Forums. EVERY DAY !! Also the good written ones where no one is flaming: TH!S GAME§ SUC(KS and so on. They´re not trying to solve problems with their community they just keep shutting eyes in front of it. The Steam Advertisement still telling potetial "NEW" Customers through Steam FALSE Game and Key Features anyway today Steam removed the Price Buttons because this isn´t near to be ready. Speaking the Truth this Game is REALLY FAR from ready its a late Alpha Stage maybe a Testing Beta Phase of this Game. I played a lot of Games since my starting Days in '93 also helped in a lot of Alphas and Betas to build and grow up but I recently never saw a Company and Developer Team that where so Fail in their Jobs like these Guys.

I'm sure the 1581 who vote negatively to this game most of them haven't even play the game... or have play it once... and that's it.... The game is fun to play for me.. and its a challenge to survive to cheaters bug waves of zombies and bandits... try that I dare you....,0,This game is a money-grabbing disaster.

The forum IP bans anyone asking for refunds or people who haven't even bought the game; and I'm not even going to go into the rumors about Arktos randomly banning people to scare away hackers or to encourage them to re-buy the game. Oh and even the cover art contains tracings of scenes from 'The Walking Dead'. Just sayin'. As for the main aspects of the game itself animation is horrific enemy AI is stupid and buggy the fall damage system is whole new joke of its own 1 hour respawn times and volatile equipment makes for a boring game just moving about or trying to find equipment is unfairly hard (and I'm one of the people who said Dark Souls DIDN'T have artificial difficulty) game encourages you to spend money on seemingly "useful" **** and to top it all off the entire environment basically looks like someone took a dump on plate and served it with a dressing of salad leaves and oatmeal. Final verdict: Just buy **** ARMA II and get Day Z instead.,1,In this game everything about money items/revive! So many hacker! guys dont buy it!Many features listed on Steam  is missing.

Which might be fine if they made some MAJOR changes and fixes but they haven't and probably won't. Arktos Entertainment (I believe it was originally called "Hammerpoint Interactive" before they decided to change their company name: probably to avoid all the bad press although I may be wrong) meant for this game to be a quick pocket liner. Their EULA were stolen from League of Legends. Their support team takes days to respond with their copied and pasted fourm letter telling you to "restart your computer" and "make sure The War Z is up to date". They promised things that were not implemented and weren't going to be implemented for a long time (For example they promised Levels and Skills when both said "coming soon..." and probably still say that). It is partially Steam's fault as they failed to mention that the game was in Beta still but they at least gave us a refund and didn't blatantly ignore their player base. There are so many things wrong with the game that I could go well beyond the 5K character max for the review so I'll just say this: The game doesn't deserve a coin so go look for a good MMO elsewhere.,0,I started playing this in Alpha and didn't notice it change to Beta.

It is free and Rocket (The lead developer) is an honest guy who knows how to properly deal with people.,8,I have played since day 1 alpha and experienced the ups downs of the game it is not for the soft core player only the hardcore competitive get up again spit in your face don't give a $^&* PLAYER. Funnest Competitive tactical shooter I have ever played most satisfying loot system (Killing Other Players).As a survivor game its all about surviving other players not the world.SomeI have played since day 1 alpha and experienced the ups downs of the game it is not for the soft core player only the hardcore competitive get up again spit in your face don't give a $^&* PLAYER. Funnest Competitive tactical shooter I have ever played most satisfying loot system (Killing Other Players). As a survivor game its all about surviving other players not the world. Some bugs make people hate it game breaking ones are always fixed. Hackers ruin the game make it unplayable without them i would need no other game. Pros Awesome loot system Tactical team driven survival against players. spawn near death a lot of armorsWeapons bullet drop vehicles global inventory die in a few shots. Cons Hackers minor bugscontent takes a long long long time to come out Hackers developer doesn't care about customers Hackers.

They have lied to their customers the is no option for 100 players and game is so full of bugs that it is laughable.,1,this game is just awful they have a cash shop where you can buy items with real money and if you die with those items you bought with real money well... you lose them. thats gotta be one of the worst systems ever well alongside Big Rigs off the Road racing... the guy who made that game had a part in this game and big rigs is regarded as one of the best games ever made.,1,Terrible game and incomplete.

Being sold to capitalize on the holidays.  The developer should be ashamed for releasing a game as bad as this.  People continue to buy it because it is on steams top sellers list.  It should be removed and all purchases should be refunded for false advertising. You will walk forever trying to find a weapon that will do something other than annoy zombies.  And by the time you find something useful someone else will kill you for it.  Items can only be saved if you quit and add it to global inventory.  There is also MICRO-TRANSACTIONS in this game.  But you buy items and someone can steal it within moments of you getting it!  Total scam but i'm sure it must be fun for the trolls to camp spawn points waiting for people to venture out so they can steal your stuff.,1,I have no idea why I bought this game. It started off very enthralling and very entertaining and then I started to realize the issues. Apart from all of the other ones listed by other members my main issues were this: Items bought with real money only apply to one character and are dropped whenever you die. "settlements" are no-pvp safe zones but they're RIDDLED with campers sittingI have no idea why I bought this game.

Apart from all of the other ones listed by other members my main issues were this: Items bought with real money only apply to one character and are dropped whenever you die. "settlements" are no-pvp safe zones but they're RIDDLED with campers sitting outside of the safe zone waiting for people to come out so they can get free gear. Spawn points are very often camped. Areas that spawn Guns/Melee items are ALWAYS camped. There are so many griefers in this game it makes any sense of community absolutely pointless. Clans will stack their members in "camp" sites and kill -anyone- including new characters. Another thing that makes this game silly? New characters only start out with a flashlight and that's -IT-. Being as all the weapon sites are camped you HAVE to spend REAL MONEY in order to get an edge. To hell with this game.,3,I had to admit the idea of a zombie apocalypse mmo sounded cool at first but this game is utterly and completely BROKEN! ITS HORRIBLE! AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!,0,So many people making sarcastic ratings and giving them 10's when they should be helping inform the public this game was a quick cashin with many models being taken from their previous "tdm" game that they have largely ignored since moving to their next cashin their business model focuses on you losing all your stuff ingame and having to use the ingame store to even have a chance makesSo many people making sarcastic ratings and giving them 10's when they should be helping inform the public this game was a quick cashin with many models being taken from their previous "tdm" game that they have largely ignored since moving to their next cashin their business model focuses on you losing all your stuff ingame and having to use the ingame store to even have a chance makes the cost to an already overpriced 15$ to100+ dollars depending on how long it takes you to realise its a scam,3,The game could be good if the developers took some time to fix things. The game is like  Superman 64 a really bad game Bad sound Hackers Textures suck The Zombie AI is awful.,5,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        This game is pretty much a DayZ clone with horrible balancing and a timer for respawning after death if you are a casual gamer i would not suggest this one for you but if your a hardcore gamer who fancies avoiding other players at all costs and are fine with the massive PvP and lag spikes that can happen at certain points in time then i would suggest it. But yes just like DayZ most players like to be bandits i got this game from a friend as a gift about 6 months ago but seeing how this game is not well optimized for casual gamers i would rather be playing the Kickstarter zombie hybrid known as 7 days to die or 7D2D that is pretty much minecraft based in a zombie apocalypse a factor that i believe also makes this a bad game is how they made it so that you need to pay Cash IRL to receive certain items from the store and to revive yourself instantly if your heavily skilled CQC zombie killing character is killed by a sniper from far off distances this i honestly cannot say is good but if your able to handle it or you just like killing people who wasted 15 dollars on this game then i guess its the type of game for you?,5,This game really has all its problems as Hacking  glitches and crashes  but its still fun to play with friends  and that's what matter for me .I won't recommend  but its pretty fun though  and i hope if u really want to check it out see videos first and then buy it if u really want,0,I came back to write a review just because I saw that this game has not improved. I bought this game when it came out on Steam and was one of many that got a refund for this game via Steam. They seriously changed their name from WarZ to Infestation: Survivor Stories? It's more like an infestation of crabs on any attempt of a good gaming experience.

When this game came out they promised vehicles more maps and a no "pay to win" set-up. I'm glad I got my money back. Knowing that I saved myself unspeakable rage. As people say get DayZ mod. If you don't mind single player open world zombie survival give State of Decay a go. It's far more enjoyable the this garbage it plays better and you don't have hackers killing you and magically flying back onto roofs. This review was my survivor story!,1,This game has only 1 fun thing about it and that's killing zombies. The zombies are a bit of a challenge too. Other then that it seems to be a HUGE rip off. There are lots of hackers and to get around the hackers you can rent a private server. Once you rent the server which comes to $33 a month you find out you have very few admin rights in fact kicking players is about all you can do.This game has only 1 fun thing about it and that's killing zombies.

Once you rent the server which comes to $33 a month you find out you have very few admin rights in fact kicking players is about all you can do. You also rent the servers from the very company that makes the game. In order to use guns in the game you need ammo. That is not a bad thing right? Well in this game you have to buy the ammo from the cash shop you can buy the ammo in small amounts using the ingame money but you soon realize that it costs a ton of ingame money to buy the ammo and the amount you buy is very small and really small and rather useless. The only way to get any real supply of ammo is using Gold credits purchased with real money. There is crafting in this game but once again you need to use real money to purchase recipes. You cannot even build your own base. Overall DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!!,7,This game should definatley be in the free-to-play section of steam as it has micro-transactions in it and is in an alpha stage (although said to be the full game in the description with plenty of features that aren't even present in the current build).

Item bought in the marketplace with real cash are not permanent and will be lost immediately upon death - which happens often considering this is a zombie survival game. With all of that in mind I advise you to hold onto your cash and either wait for the complete game or the standalone Day Z.,0,Worst game ever. The developer should pay us for even trying it out. No support free to hack basically nothing good has come out of this game and properly never will. Game developers bans people for "free speech" but not hackers for ruining the game even more.,1,I played the game at a friend's house and found it to be pretty boring as well as a blatant rip off of the DayZ mod for Arma 2.  I've also seen the articles that describe all the shady stuff the developer has tried to do with the game's steam page and the micro-transactions.  My advice to everyone would be to steer clear of this game if it ever reappears on Steam (it was pulled earlier today).,6,This game is good despite what people say. If they focus on fixing everything and on keeping Titov quiet they might actually have a decent product on their hands.,6,Game is fine if you have to know that those screenshots aren't fake at all there is that is going to be put in the game and soon but its ok they are updating the game at a reasonable fast rate and asking the people what they want in the game which is very good in my opinion. Also the "clan" system isn't real money at all you just need to get 20 hours which is fine the real money part isGame is fine if you have to know that those screenshots aren't fake at all there is that is going to be put in the game and soon but its ok they are updating the game at a reasonable fast rate and asking the people what they want in the game which is very good in my opinion. Also the "clan" system isn't real money at all you just need to get 20 hours which is fine the real money part is just if you want to expand your clan beyond 20 people. Graphics are the last thing in my head about this game but they are updating them also in these little things called patch's but yea game is fine get a set of friends tho you will need to survive.,0,Not worth a penny. The game is a pain to play. There are no weapons to be found anywhere and if there are then another person is already camping the place or it's filled with zombies that runs faster than you and can damage you while you have no chance of fighting back. The zombies also look like crap and could look as if you were playing the game on a PS1. Some of the othergraphicsNot worth a penny. The game is a pain to play.

The zombies also look like crap and could look as if you were playing the game on a PS1. Some of the othergraphics however are decent though they're filled with glitches and doesn't match how much the game consumes of the PC. Not to say I had any difficulty playing it at ultra settings with 60 framerate but a lot of the game just really does look as an old PS1 game. Gameplay well after 4 hours of trying I didn't get to that thing just yet because every time I tried well I died. The game neither does give you any training so you're on your own from the start which can be very difficult. The game doesn't deserve ANY recommendation by me and I hope those "developers" do something about the game when I paid my hard-earned money on such a disaster,8,The game had a really rough launch and it was clear that hackers bugs and other stuff ruined a big part of the game. The first day I tried it I was alive for about 5 minutes when I was shot. I was like "Bullsh*t!". So after playing it a few days I really thought it was the biggest waste of money ever. So I had a break but after a while it came to me that I've never experienced the sameThe game had a really rough launch and it was clear that hackers bugs and other stuff ruined a big part of the game. The first day I tried it I was alive for about 5 minutes when I was shot. I was like "Bullsh*t!". So after playing it a few days I really thought it was the biggest waste of money ever. So I had a break but after a while it came to me that I've never experienced the same tension in a game like this before so I gave it another go. Yes I was shot a few times again but you can compare this game to let's say Counter-Strike. If you haven't played it before you will start the game and get shot round after round and so you'll ragequit. When I got back to The War Z or now Infestation: Survivor Stories I managed to find some gear and a gun after working hard and at this point today I am actually doing well having some backup gear in my global inventory and always a gun and some bandages at my side. All the reviews I've read is stating that it was made to rob you from money by the real-money system but looking further into it you can buy almost the exact same things from in-game money which is dropped by zombies. And yes you'll most of the time see 2 dollars 4 dollars 38 dollars but it doesn't take many zombies untill you find a stack of 1000 dollars. I was so lucky to find 10k in a stack. Yes the zombie AI is pretty low but it is a dead guy walking. All zombies in every movies/game ever is stupid as hell. So yes the zombies are stupid and 1 zombie or 5 zombies doesn't compose a big threat but when you find yourself in the middle of the night in an airport or militarybase and the noise you make suddenly requires you to run or even open fire those 500 zombies who rise from the grass and chases you suddenly becomes a bigger priority than anything else. When people complain about being shot all the time I can't help to think it's their own fault. You run around on a big map and of course you wanna get from point A to B as fast as possible but if you start running in a straight line on an open road you make yourself a human target. That's why there's grass trees crouch and prone mode  to sneak around. Check your back stop up and look around before charging into a town or city. I think the people behind was at the same stage I was at my first few days. When you get into it this game is so amazing and has so much to offer. They have great graphics the atmosphere is tense and depressing so you really get the feeling that you are all alone and there's no dear momma. You will never feel as frightened as when you hear a nearby gunshot or when you see another player walking around. It's like when you hear a noise in the dark  all your senses are are crystal clear and focused in a split-second. I've never stumpled upon a game that gives the same excitement as Infestation: Survivor Stories when you find a nice item the same reward whether it be loot or just the feeling inside when you've won a fight or the same tense feeling when you see or hear any sign of another player because you'll never know if it will be you or him who leaves alive. I'll give it an 8. It has been out for half a year now and  they have had plenty of time to make even simple fixes. Implementing Punkbuster seems to have gotten rid of hackers (and still is as you find your chat spammed with players who are banned!) Infestation: Survivor Stories is a game that puts you on the edge of your chair with a raised heartbeat and adrenaline pumping it is truly a game worth giving a(nother) shot!,1,This game is a game. The only worse scam I can think of is colonial marines but its a close call.   It was removed from steam as for being false but steam brought it back recently. Nothing has changed steam dont really care and just want to rip you off The War Z developers are still incompetent.

The only upside if that if your a developer and you see a CV with any of "those" names on it you can put it straight in the shredder without wasting your time.    As a scam it was lucky.  Steam actually did more to create a successful scam than War Z did though as most of us probably wouldnt have touched it otherwise.  The sad thing about games like this is that they undermine community funding and support for titles which are realistically positioned advertised and supported. Many indie companies ARE doing a good job and DO try to meet expectations.  These guys never did.,10,Jogo muito FODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,10,Since the beginning of the game people have been B*tching about how the Devs are so terrible and people even claimed that they planned on sacking the project and running away with our money.Here we are almost in 2014 and not just is the game still around it's better than ever!

There are VERY FEW issues that I've experienced in my ~240 hours of game-play and playing CO-OP with a friend is the highlight of the game.The Devs have learned from their early mistakes and are doing things much more professionally now. I do not consider myself very good at this game but it's still fun to play and well worth the $7.49 that Steam is selling it for right now. PROS: Easy to learn (compared to other games like DayZ) fun Solo or CO-OP game-play constant developments in the game make it interesting. CONS: Graphics are 50% good 50% bad Example: The graphics in the background (mountains trees) is quite good where as the close up graphics (Zombies melees weapons) is quite bad. As a new spawn you will probably be gunned down by a long time player with a machine gun. Overall I would highly recommend the game. I've played about 240 hours off-and-on and it's still such a fun passtime. Also those of you who have declared the game terrible in the past: I urge you to try playing it again. The newest updates have greatly improved the game.,10,Is currently the best and most complete game of survival! There is nothing when it was warz! Complete system of crafting reputation and experience but is still in development.,5,It's a low quality game but is it worth $15? Yes. I do have fun playing the game trying to go around areas undetected by zombies and other players who kill on sight. It's a game about surviving and that's what you are trying to do 100% of the time. There is so much room for improvement. I just hope the developers actually listen to the suggestions they are getting for new features.,0,Fui hackeado não posso entrar mais na minha conta o suporte deles não ajuda ou seja não estão nem ai para você desistam desse jogo não comprem  a melhor coisa que faz para o seu dinheiro!!!,7,people rip on this game from the hacker issues well i didnt complain and played through the tough times. warz is now becoming a fantastic game it is a fun game to play with friends. i believe it has some downfalls like it not having cars or more guns but i would recommend,7,The War Z has a horrible reputation that alone will drive away many potential buyers. For that same reason I did not purchase the game until only recently. After playing for a few days I will say that I am actually having fun. I play with one of my friends and we have a blast sneaking through dense zombie infested regions to get those few cans of food or that bottle of water (or if we'reThe War Z has a horrible reputation that alone will drive away many potential buyers.

I play with one of my friends and we have a blast sneaking through dense zombie infested regions to get those few cans of food or that bottle of water (or if we're lucky a new weapon.) And then the thrill of hearing nearby gunshots and praying they are not meant for you is a pleasant change in the world of fast paced FPS games. What really made me purchase this game though was seeing that the developers were releasing new patches constantly. To me that means they really are trying to get the game to where everyone will like it. Hammerpoint clearly isn't a pro though and it is taking time. I like to think of the game at the moment as an in an alpha phase and now that I purchased it I get to watch it grow and hopefully bloom.,5,The War Z is an obvious grab for cash after the Day Z craze but still has its merits. It improved many things that were flawed in Day Z such as loading times and UI. Zombies are also much smarter than they were in Day Z and actually will quit following you after a while whereas in Day Z zombies would chase you until you made them go up a hill.

It improved many things that were flawed in Day Z such as loading times and UI. Zombies are also much smarter than they were in Day Z and actually will quit following you after a while whereas in Day Z zombies would chase you until you made them go up a hill. However the zombie AI isn't great and you can pretty much outsmart them by jumping on boxes where they cannot hit you or jumping through windows. The zombies are glued to the ground basically and will not walk through anything that isn't a doorway. If you've played Left 4 Dead you will be very disappointed in the zombie AI. There is no voice chat. Day Z had voice chat yet this is still not implemented. Honestly there are a lot of features that are already in Day Z that haven't even been put in War Z. I also feel the sneaking around zombies was much better in Day Z but that's because the engine was made for that kind of stuff. The game is also a lot smaller than Day Z which is a good and bad thing. It doesn't feel as much like a hike to get from town to town as they're pretty close together. This does mean that there is fewer towns and thus more interaction with other players. This is probably the reason that most of the servers are capped at only 50 players. There are 20 servers that are capped at 100 players but if you go to those expect to be killed by a hacker because 90% of the playerbase hacks. Oh and there is a river that flows through the middle of the map that you can't swim through because you can't swim. The only way to get to the other side is to literally follow it until it ends then go around. This is really stupid. Overall I rate it a 5 because its an unfinished game and still somewhat fun. I don't think it's completely horrible; if it gets updated it could be a solid 7. If they at the very least add in all the features that Day Z currently has it would be a decent game. I probably would recommend this game if you liked Day Z its not horrible but just needs a bit of updates.,6,I am going to try and be as objective as possible with my review. I can say from first hand experience and many hours of game time. This game is unfinished. Keeping that in mind it is very fun in it's current state. Most of the reviews I've seen for this game are on the extreme side of negative for one reason or another. Gameplay: This game is hard. It is unforgiving at times.

Keeping that in mind it is very fun in it's current state. Most of the reviews I've seen for this game are on the extreme side of negative for one reason or another. Gameplay: This game is hard. It is unforgiving at times. The learning curve is steep. This does not make this a bad game. Once you learn how to collect weapons without dying. (easier said then done) Your satisfaction will improve immensely. As of writing this review the game is mostly PvP. If you go into it not knowing that It will be a hard pill to swallow. With more things to do promised in the future everything is looking up. Value: The game is 15 dollars. Not 15 on sale but regularly priced at 15 dollars. I've gotten many hours from this and I can't see how I haven't gotten my moneys worth. In the it's current state I can understand why people aren't happy with this game. That being said this game doesn't deserve a 0. It's a fun game and will only get better with time.,5,Fail start- Good end ? I purchased myself the standard edition though i have read already all reviews about this game.

However i was angry in the beginning after the purchase. The payment went okey same goes for the installation. I launched the game and i died how come  Spawn killing bandit on a random server. Been playing it for hours and i kept dying hour for hour. I was really angry. At one point on me for buying this game and on the other hand on the developers. However after i played it for around 1 month i realized its not such a bad game. Well it is but not in all ways. You need much logical thinking good knowledge of the map and stuff. You will surely keep dying in the first hours unless you have a partner with you. I was playing solo and i did not except dying and dying. You can have fun with this game yes but you should follow some rules. Do not join big servers find good farming spots trust noone. By following this simple 3 rules you can make up a good gear and then you are ready for action. The most annoying point about this game are not the 35 bugs i counted but the same linear action. You spawn farm weapons and gear kill zombies or players get to the sage zone hide stuff and you start again with Point 1. I hope the developers will include more Feautures till now its a bad game developing to a casual pay2win mmo for days when you have really nothing else to play 5/10,7,I really don't understand people that write reviews since they didn't even try the game. The only mistake the publisher made was the "Steam question". You can't even think to put something unfinished on Steam. So the self-called "experts" could vomit what they would on this mediocre game. I think War Z is highly improvable but it's not the "Big Rigs" they want us to believe.

I think War Z is highly improvable but it's not the "Big Rigs" they want us to believe. It's a good idea that have some difficult to separe his idea of gameplay from Day Z's one. Premises and (mostly) promises are really encouraging. The game itself is really fun (if played in co-op) and the "surviving atmosphere" is well-given.,1,You know it's true what people say. A blowjob in the morning DOES make your day better. Oh  this has nothing to do with War Z you think? Good eye brother!

The developers need to shape up listen to the community and fix the game. Instead of spreading lies and then "apologizing" thinking that we will forgive them.

I honestly never expect this game to get an overall good review but i feel that any one considering buying this game should know the truth. It's a playable and fun game with mates now that it's more or less hack free there is a lot of promised new content such as cars new maps new weapons and so on the game has a huge potential but without lying to you the game company running it is far from the best but if you're willing to be patient i can assure you that for £10-15 it's money well spent if you play with your friends you can find whole days going by playing this game.,7,I have never experienced a bug never been killed by a hacker and never glitched or crashed.  The major problems people were griping about have been fixed.  Its been patched 6 times since Christmas.  Gameplay videos on youtube are often set to low settings so that the person can record smoothly on ultra/high settings the games actually kind of pretty.

That being said the developer deserves all the bad press they got.  They behaved shamefully.  However I really don't have time for video game politics.  I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time and DayZ is too simulation level hard core for me.  Give this one a chance guys its worth it for $15.,7,I wanted my first review to be a difficult one so what better choice than The War Z?  First off I have to say that I've indeed played the ARMA 2 mod 'Day Z' and I wasn't impressed; though that's another review altogether.  I bought The War Z very early by buying the "Pioneer" package which entitled me to some Gold Coins (which is the micro-transaction currency in the game) and jumped inI wanted my first review to be a difficult one so what better choice than The War Z?

I bought The War Z very early by buying the "Pioneer" package which entitled me to some Gold Coins (which is the micro-transaction currency in the game) and jumped in with some friends.  The game was plagued with bugs ran sub-par even on low settings and I still managed to have an amazing time.  There have been many improvements since then but the fun has only managed to trend downwards.  The biggest problem with this game (other than the angry children who only seem to see the game's shortcomings and the fact that I can't turn off global chat in-game) is that there is no real goal.  You can collect all the rare weapons kill survivors/zombies traverse the massive countryside until you're mauled by an invisible hacker but to what end?  You can't grow your character build a safe house and fill it with your loot nothing to make you want to continue playing.  The currently available map 'Colorado' is huge which would be a good thing except all this really does for you is make it pain staking to reach the safe zone and store your items. Basically it's a game with a ton of potential and I truly hope they can work their issues out.  Is this a good game in it's current condition?  Absolutely not.  Does it deserve thousands of 0 ratings from scrubs who played it for 5 minutes and got a refund?  Absolutely not.,7,The War Z. One of the most pissed on games I have ever had the pleasure of playing and I say pleasure based on how fun "The War Z" Tends to be. Let's get this part out of the way "The War Z" has so many issues there are almost too many to count. While there are Graphical glitches game play glitches and the overall lazy attitude of the Dev Team makes "The War Z" pretty terrible toThe War Z.

While there are Graphical glitches game play glitches and the overall lazy attitude of the Dev Team makes "The War Z" pretty terrible to play. One of the worst features (while also being the best) is the cash shop. It works better than any cash shop of any F2P (Free to play) model video game on the market and this is a pretty big problem considering it is NOT a F2P game but  B2P (Buy to play) model. The cash shop is also very expensive and it is very easy to to just toss your money away grabbing some fantastic items only to loose them to a hacker just waiting for someone to walk by. There are a many great good things about "The War Z" as well.It is extremely fun. No matter how many glitches a game has "cough cough CS 1.6" games with glitches can be astoundingly fun as long as the player can look past imperfections. We as gamers these days have been pampered with state of the art graphics complete immersion and a realistic sense to video games that is really a "Boner killer" when it comes to video games.Looking past that you can take random damage that none of the equip items fit on the Female body the Night vision goggles don't really do anything is extremely laggy for no apparent reason on ultra settings and is made to be a "cash grab" (although what game isn't made to make money I mean really guys. A point off because they want to make money?) I find "The War Z" to be one of the funnest games I've played all year. A lot of people out there are saying that the "DayZ" "Arma 2" Mod is better. In certain aspects it is and in others it isn't."The War Z" controls are extremely easy to get used to and isn't a whole war simulator just to kill some zombies. The amount of detail put into "The War Z" should give it enough credit to bring it to quite a high point scale.For $15 you can see for yourself how good this game CAN be. I mean it's only a measly 15 dollars and with the continued updates to make the game better it is sure to be an "acceptable" game by priss video game standards.It's worth a try if you can get your head out of DayZ's butt.Thank you for your time spent reading my review.,7,I just bought this game with some tf2 items because some of my friends were playing it. I know that a lot of people says that this game is horrible but I have a lot of fun with my friends playing it I can't stop laughing when we scare the people with the pistols killing zombies epic fails etc. If it is true that the game is beta I will be very happy if the developers can finish thisI just bought this game with some tf2 items because some of my friends were playing it.

Sure there is need for improvement but at it's core it is a fun game to play. BUT the developers are misleading and ignorant. The whole deal with the steam page is just disgraceful and they're blatant ignorance of hate towards the game as "DayZI have played this game for many weeks now since the first initial alpha release and i have to say it's not as bad as everyone claims.

The whole deal with the steam page is just disgraceful and they're blatant ignorance of hate towards the game as "DayZ Fanboys" is stupid. I find this game more fun than DayZ personally (was addicted to DayZ for months). Both have glitches both have hackers. Both are fun. The only thing i dislike is the attitude of the devs in WarZ they just seem to want to get as much money as possible and don't listen to the community as much. Rest assured they are trying to make a better game but I feel that the overwhelming hatred from the community will eventually force them to quit and people will say "I told you so" when they caused the problem. I'd wait to full release to play.,8,It isn't better than Dayz and won't be however this game is worth playing for $15. The game continues to prove every 2-3 weeks with updates so it's not a dead game. Also it would be better with a better anti-cheat software for hackers. I'm playing this game while I wait on the Dayz SA. Hopefully I can keep playing this game as it has a ton of potential.

The game is fun now but be warned that you can't trust anyone (for the most part) like in Dayz (lol). I think people hate this game because it's a tough game and the hackers. I would give it a try if you like zombie games.  8.3/10 is the rating I'd give it.,6,The War Z where to start...Firstly I'm amazed of the poor "critic" reviews highly unprofessional for instance PC gamer whom I thought were serious goes on and on about it beeing a DayZ knock off same goes for MMORPG.com et.c.Of course it´s a knock off we'll be seeing more of them too hell DayZ IS knock off period.Also before I get labeled a "fan boy" you should know that I amThe War Z where to start...Firstly I'm amazed of the poor "critic" reviews highly unprofessional for instance PC gamer whom I thought were serious goes on and on about it beeing a DayZ knock off same goes for MMORPG.com et.c.Of course it´s a knock off we'll be seeing more of them too hell DayZ IS knock off period.Also before I get labeled a "fan boy" you should know that I am a Day Z fan (teh horror a day z fan beeing positive about the war z..) and are eagerly awaiting the stand alone game. Anyway the War Z I've been around since the alpha release and have seen all the problems people go on about there still are tons of problems and all the promised features haven't been put in yet however it is playable and quite enjoyable at that. However if you´re looking for a finished product my advice is to wait this has a ton of potential but isn't quite there yet as I said it's allready quite enjoyable but still.,6,Jeux encore en BETA donc plein de bug de son surface a corriger!Sinon le principe est assez simple.. et accessible a tous le monde! Ya plusieurs mauvais point comme des bon!A vous de voir... Personnellement jaime bien le jeux.. sa vos 15$,0,I think the game is pretty good so far in general however.. I bought the pioneer package at the start of alpha for $30 one thing that I don't really think is a good idea is the cash shop revival system pretty much the cash shop in general if I paid for the game already why should I dish out more cash?

But the game is fun to play. The interface is a little more mainstream then Dayz and this makes it more Newb friendly. The hate is from people wanting to hate it. It is a game stolen and it is okay.,7,Was looking for a game like this I played dayZ and love that game. WarZ has a lot to build on bring potential to its foundation version. They update a couple times a month adding new item building artwork a good player bad player element and will soon be skill tree. Understanding that it is a work in progress and is constantly being worked on and improved.,7,Its an average game that at times makes your kidneys wrench and your gut whirl in paranoia not knowing what is behind you shumbling at you or a fellow survivor staring at your figure through a gun and deciding. The War Z may have it's ups and downs but it attempts to stay above and make contact with its userbase.,7,I've never seen a more undeserved rating. Granted the game is rough as **** but it's 15 dollars. You will not get a better game for that price anywhere. If you did buy an expensive package and didn't research beforehand I have no sympathy for you. Would you go buy a car because the commercial made it sound awesome? No. You ****ing research it. This many tears haven't been shed since 911.I've never seen a more undeserved rating. Granted the game is rough as **** but it's 15 dollars. You will not get a better game for that price anywhere.

This many tears haven't been shed since 911. The internet is and has been filled with controversy over this game for months. If you dropped 30 or more dollars on this without researching it it's on you. The devs are jackasses there's some hackers it needs work etc. But the game is absolutely worth 15 dollars. Also bugs and glitches are quite overstated. Lack of new content is hurting this game.,7,Purchased this game on Steam (which fails to acknowledge that it is still in beta on the War Z store page) and requested a RMA 4 hours later. I feel my time is better spent with the fantastic Arma II mod Day Z. With War Z currently in beta at the moment you will find broken game play and environments; from invisible walls to glitchy life ending hill drops to spotty AI.

I feel your money is best saved for its final release if by then it is fixed too . This is the problem,5,All in all my hope for The War Z is crumbling. The standalone version of the Arma2-Mod DayZ is going to kick WarZ's ass if it does not get quickly better  There were some minor improvements but still it tastes like a DayZ clone.,7,Despite all the criticism of OP productions and the poor job of the developers this was still a fun game. Once the first hacker purge occurred you could actually play it. Lack of actual content was its downfall. This game shines when you are in a clan. Traveling with your mates is a fun time.,7,Personally I love Infestation. I've played The War Z since launch and have always had a good time while playing.

The game still remains to have Hackers on but from the 200 hours i've played of it i've only ever witnessed possibly 1 and he got banned too. The developers are hunting down on hackers and are concentrating on bringing in new updates to make the community happy. From what i've seen the Hammerpoint company have been looking into the game more and have been trying to release some awesome new stuff. Only problem i would say is the 'Market place' i dont really like the idea of it. It makes an unfair advantage to players who can buy things and to players who cannot. Also GC is quite pricey in the Market place and items have been given a higher GC count for example; the personal locker was 110 GC the next day i checked it was 250 GC...Overall this game has been fun and exciting to play especially with a team! I just hope the company decides to not ruin the game too much and improve by adding things the Community wants more often. -Fix the bugs-Fix the FPS for players with certain PC's-Add cars? Add the new maps?Game would be 10/10 then hopefully!,7,Lack of Quests Missions Story or anything of the sort will put many people off.  If you like the sandbox survival genre you will like War Z.  it is very similar to that of Day Z.  Will not argue which is better as it will just lead no where.

I mean I'll talk to someone in a safe zone all friendly and as soon as I leave the protected area I'll hear shots and find out they were tracking me.  Beyond this I've enjoyed my time in game but I wish they had a couple PVE servers.

I was surprised that it released on Steam and I completely understand how everyone felt purchasing the game as it was when it didn't meet the didn't meet the detailed specs.  I was also upset with the change in respawn time.  I believe the company made a number of huge marketing boners but I don't dislike the game because of it. Although still playable on Steam the game is no longer available for purchase from Steam.  I've heard that the respawn change has also been redacted.  The price of the game has dropped to $15 with no subscription fees.  For what it is a game still pretty much in the beta state I think it's worth playing.,0,A total rip off cash in avoid at all costs. I gave this game the benefit of the doubt but in the end its all about maximising profit whilst giving the player a very simple and boring experience. Im surprised its not made by EA.,8,You guys are too rough on the game. Yes they did advertise features that are not yet present but the game right now is quite fun.

Many things need to be fixed and/or completed but still a enjoyable game none the less especially in a group setting. The zombies are not what they should be and the game does need some serious optimizing but i am able to run it just fine on high settings not with the FPS i am use to but problem free none the less. This game is a work in progress and has great potential and should not be written off so quickly  especially if the Dev's would stop worrying about the little things in the game and move on to the RPG side of the game to give it more balance. Long story short this game is enjoyable it will make you laugh it will make you cuss and yes maybe some crying in there as well. Happy gaming.,9,so Warz is a super cool game you just do not get in the game with a rating on it is good or bad and spend a little more than an hour on it any time with a friend but quickly becomes caught up in it and can not get enough there many bugs but you do not think much about it when you first started with the,10,"Haters gonna hate."

There was a giant bandwagon of War Z haters from reddit and other places who are trying to burn this game to the ground due to a few errors made by the devs.  If any of these folks actually spent a few hours playing the game they would realize how it is actually a pretty fun game. The game is still in workingFirst off most of these negative reviews are not from actual customers.

But as it progresses along new features are added.  At it's core it's a zombie survival game with an open environment.  I think what makes the game the most entertaining is the feeling of dread you get not only when you come across a town full of zombies...but when you realize someone else living is there too and you have no idea how they are going to react to your presence.  Will you just exchange a quick nod which is really a mask for your fear of being shot in the face by them?  Or will you wait until they have their back turned and kill them before they kill you? Regardless of the current backlash from some members I've decided to keep playing the game and waiting for new updates.,8,I have been playin Warz since november and really enjoy it.

I would be happy with a return to the 1 hr timer with an option to pay to revive early.  There has been quite a bit of community mismanagement and PR issues but that doesn't take away from the game itself.  If I were in charge I would say the game is in beta but you can pre-order (at full price) for early entry.  Gear is relatively easy to get so early entry isn't a killer.   The game needs polish and fill out of features but the overall game play is great.,8,First thing to know:  This game is a work-in-progress.   You can get this game for about $15.

Many are angry from not understanding that this is the type of game you are going to play.  There is no holding hands there is no "noob friendly" gameplay.  People in this game are ruthless and people that help others are very very few and far between.  You'll be Killed on Sight almost everytime so you have to play smart and watch populated areas until you can safely move.If this is the kind of survival simulator you are looking for then this game will be awesome for you.  The goal is simple:  How long can you survive and are you good enough to go out into towns cities and the wilderness to find supplies ammo weapons food and possible companions to help you... And now can you make it back to a safezone alive and safe with all that loot so that you can store it for later adventures?Many will try only a few will succeed.  Are you going to be one of them?  The world is full of bandits raiders deuche-bags and those that find absolute joy in killing you and taking your spoils of war. If you want a flowery wandering and wonderful experience of fairies and lollipops don't even get close to this game.  It is brutal and unforgiving but if you love a challenge strategy patience to watch and wait for that perfect moment to take action then this game will give you the satisfaction you want from a hardcore game. Day/Night cycles.  Night is brutally unforgiving the whole screen is basically black with the audio of the zombies and the footsteps of other scavengers trying to hunt you or find the supplies you need and are looking for.  Only the stupid use their flashlights to see... that just lets us know where you now are... In-game bank to store your spoils and lootz of war (if you can make it back alive when you go back out you can re-equip from your bank as needed) The Cons:  The game is still being worked on.  There are a lot of rough edges the developers are still adding game elements and changing rules and game mechanics every few weeks so you must be able to flow with that becuase the game is still in its basic stages.  But for $15 this game is awesome.  There are no friends list yet you can only do "Clans" right now to keep/find buddies in the game. The Pros:  Some servers run with 100 players at once and I've experienced NO LAG during those times I run a slower computer and the game is smooth on my screen.  Where you aim is where you hit I haven't had any LAG aiming problems.  This game is rough but for what you get (not all selilng points of the game are there yet) you get an awesome game-in-progress. Best $15 I ever spent for a Zombie Survival Game Online! Graphics are "fine" for a $15 game.  Audio is "fine" for $15 game.  Don't expect AAA musical score or graphics that would melt a $5k computer.  But the overall-core gameplay is solid (survive scavenge PVP and SURVIVE) Don't listen to the haters.  They wanted COD-meets-COUNTER STRIKE.  They got The War Z instead so they rage-whined and QQQ'd on metacritic here...,8,I think that this game it's very cool. Of course developers must change and fix a lot of things but.. that's not the final version so... ppl please stop crying and hating. In my opinion these guys want to do a really good game. I'm waiting for the new content.,8,The War Z is a great game for many different types of players. It does need development. Many people think that this game is a copy of the mod for Arma 2 "Day Z" if they could look more closely then they will see that this game was not a copy of it and it has some features that Day Z won't have.,8,From a player who bought the game from the beginning it has been a roller coaster of wins/fails.  Honestly the game isn't bad but the Devs always change something that was fine were it standed to something unusual or frustrating.  But they do listen to the community and they are striving to create the game we want!  Adding in .22 weapons changing servers back to reasonable populationsFrom a player who bought the game from the beginning it has been a roller coaster of wins/fails.  Honestly the game isn't bad but the Devs always change something that was fine were it standed to something unusual or frustrating.  But they do listen to the community and they are striving to create the game we want!  Adding in .22 weapons changing servers back to reasonable populations testing measures to oppose hacking.  They are trying!  Now about the game-play.  The zombies arn't so terrifying as they should be one-to-one but when you agro about 20 in town sh*t gets crazy real fast.  The encounters with other players are very satisfying.  You never know when someone is going to shoot you in the back or drop you a hammer and be on their way.  Shooting is very nice and gunfights are quite amazing and heart pounding.  Loot spawns are pretty common now food use to be real scarce and now drops everywhere!  Guns can be found just about anywhere and anyone can arm up in the right spots with a new character if they're lucky. So the game overall is fun but now here comes the bad side.  Hackers.  They are still out there even after the Devs banned over 3000 accounts they are killable but very difficult.  Server Hopping.  One player can go to an area over several servers and loot everything.  This hasn't been appropriately dealt with yet as the devs are working on more features and hackers. So it's got it flaws but soon enough this game will be a gem.  Definitely look into if you if you want a great survival shooter. Last note.  Most of these really low ratings are completely over-exaggerated.  Some people arn't cut out for it brutal world and others flame the game based on it's relevance to DayZ.  Some people weren't fans of just a mod henceforth why I bought the game over Arma 2 which is much more realistic if that's your thing but I prefer what Hammerpoint has to offer.  Perhaps DayZ's Standalone will be something to look into when it's released.,8,Played it for several weeks now and having played Day Z this game is fun and more polished.  Sure it's got a long way to go and they've made mistakes but at $15 it's hard to go wrong.,8,Too bad this game got so much press bad before it even entered Beta testing. The gaming world has spoken and the witch hunt is on. Obviously this is not a perfect game there are problems with it however a  user metacritic score of 1.3 shows the shallowness of the metacritic reviewer. This is same mentality that gave mass effect 3 a 4.6 and modern warfare 3 a score of 3.3. The premiseToo bad this game got so much press bad before it even entered Beta testing.

This is same mentality that gave mass effect 3 a 4.6 and modern warfare 3 a score of 3.3. The premise of this game is very interesting open world survival mmorpg and while the execution was somewhat lacking there is nothing quite as tense as the PvP confrontations in this game. In 25 years of gaming I can honestly say I have never been as viscerally scared as I was after raiding for three hours and then having another player run into your view. There has been much made of server problems hackers and glitches. and while these were pretty widespread during the alpha things have improved tremendously in beta. I will not argue that this game is a copy of Day Z however I will argue that every game is a rip off of another game somehow. EVERY game barrows ideas mechanics settings art enemies from somewhere else and we're better for it . This game is much more accessible than Day Z there are random spawns so you don't have to worry about spawn campers. Additionally the controls aren't as complex as Day Z the zombies don't instantly overwhelm you you begin with a flashlight that you can melee and it is possible to run away if there are too many zombies. Overall I felt it was a flawed but satisfying experience and for $20 dollars I've certainly gotten my moneys worth out of this game.,8,This is good game but people don't understand that is in development.I really enjoy the game.People have to just stop crying and wait for the dev team to work in the game.Just go a read the important threads in the forum and not just the crying threads .Also you bought a game that don't cost too much comparing to other games so don't cry.By the way before buying a gameThis is good game but people don't understand that is in development.I really enjoy the game.People have to just stop crying and wait for the dev team to work in the game.Just go a read the important threads in the forum and not just the crying threads .Also you bought a game that don't cost too much comparing to other games so don't cry.By the way before buying a game investigate it see how the progress of development goes in which state is the game.Come on guys you are only spoiled little brats crying because is not looking as the promotional images.You don't know how hard is the development of a game.Come dev team I trust you.,8,If you bought this game expecting it to be like DayZ.. I feel sorry you spent your money. DayZ's base game is an army simulator. There are certain features that will never be included in WarZ. In my opinion WarZ is a great game concept. User interface is easy to use game looks OK even though it still needs to be worked visually and performance wise and gameplay is not as stiff as DayZ.If you bought this game expecting it to be like DayZ..

User interface is easy to use game looks OK even though it still needs to be worked visually and performance wise and gameplay is not as stiff as DayZ. I think the game should have stayed in Alpha/Beta stage a bit longer in order to get more polished and to have more of the features (such as the skill tree and friends list) working. CONCLUSION: If you LOVE DayZ... If you enjoy the simulation features of it and how it plays... I don't recommend this game to you... But if you think DayZ is hard to master you don't like simulation factor or some other thing is bothering you I say give this game a try. People claim it's PAY 2 WIN... I say it's not.. I've bought the Survivor pack (cheapest pack) and haven't spent anymore than that and I have lot's of fun.,8,Foreword: Before playing the War Z I had not played DayZ so I can't compare the two games. Though I will freely say they're two different beasts just with similar content matter. Oh and this is gonna be long. Deal with it.I originally purchased this game about a week after the initial release after having some doubts as to whether it'd be worth the money. I'm not aForeword: Before playing the War Z I had not played DayZ so I can't compare the two games. Though I will freely say they're two different beasts just with similar content matter. Oh and this is gonna be long. Deal with it. I originally purchased this game about a week after the initial release after having some doubts as to whether it'd be worth the money. I'm not a tight-lipped person by any means but I wanted some off-hand opinions from people first. Aside from some major technical issues on the first day which I can chalk up to server overloads I'd heard mostly good words from my friends. So I figured I'd buy it. And I did. $20 well spent in my opinion. My first impression was kind of soured by getting spawn-killed by another player with a flashlight about 10 seconds after spawning. That I'm gonna chalk up to misfortune because to date it has not happened again. It IS possible to be killed by zombies upon spawning in the game world but that happens as a result of poor player planning 90% of the time (read: logging out in a dangerous spot). Starting off alone I began playing with the lessons learned from the players on the forums; I didn't want to go in willy-nilly. Once you figure out that you have to aim for the head in order to do damage to zombies you get a certain feeling of power over the game's PvE elements. As a result of one of the most recent updates zombies have more or less doubled or tripled in number. You learn that stealth is the way to go that you have to watch how much noise you make that having a team by your side is near mandatory if you don't want to see the "You have died. Killed by zombies." screen too often. Don't get me wrong it's going to happen. A lot. Zombie Apocalypse + Trigger Happy Players + Unrestricted PvP = Many many deaths = Losing your hard-earned loot Many players are not trustworthy and often the game devolves into a Shoot-On-Sight affair with other players as a result. This causes problems because inevitably defending yourself from 'Neutral' players will lead to you being branded a bandit. This isn't the game's fault; it's a result of players being given free reign and consequently going on rampages. I knew about it and I went in with a 'Don't Shoot First' policy. For the most part it hasn't worked but on the few occasions where it has when players begin to work together the game truly shines. Solo gamers are essentially punished; it is entirely possible to play on your own but the game is infinitely easier when playing in a group. Getting surrounded by 10+ zombies without a gun while you're in a competent group isn't necessarily a death trap in a group. Taking on firefights as a team through out-of-game VOIP (ingame VOIP does not exist as of yet but it's apparently a coming feature) is a rewarding experience (well if you win) and it makes the otherwise aggravating PvP element engaging and quite enjoyable. The game is a bit glitchy I will admit. Fall damage is a bit twitchy; sometimes going down a small slope will result in fall damage. The server is prone to kicking you out though that might just be my connection failing miserably. The game engine has generally improved as time has progressed however. Please note: The game engine has seen significant optimization since the 31st of October and it plays smooth enough for me now. I've been running the game on Lowest settings on a 6-year-old iMac running WinXP and I get between 5-20 FPS depending on the situation. I expect most players would be playing on comparatively better machines so you'll be able to play on Normal/High/Ultra settings with ease. Personally I can't say much for the graphics. Playing on Lowest I'm not really getting the full picture. But the current game map of Colorado is competently done. The place looks appropriately bushy with okay-ish textured grass mountains and terrain. The buildings aren't spectacular but they look appropriately worn down and help to immerse you into the game. Minor graphical issues such as Third Person and First Person views having different gun models for the same weapon pop up occasionally but I can understand that not being a priority for the game developers. Sound wise I'm not a big fan. The music is annoying so I just turned it off. Ingame noises such as the moans of zombies and firing of weapons do the job of getting the point across. Annoyingly the game randomly throws loud noises at you. I guess it succeeds in scaring the pants off you but it's a cheap tactic. In regards to hackers I've only ever had to deal with them a couple of times. I guess it's hit and miss but they do seem to have generally disappeared. Don't believe all the media attention and haters. Go play the game and formulate your own opinions. To summarize: Go in with an open mind and a few friends. You'll love it.,10,Ignore the nerd rage this game is COMPLETELY underscored.

There are still problems with the game and not all features are in the game yet. I do however feel the devs are very unprofessional at times and are trying to turn this game into something bad. Just recently they added a cost to revive your guy sooner so you dont have to wait 4hours. Now you do have 5 total characters and could delete them if they did die but you would be losing their stats and for new players they will def. die 5 times within 4 hours of playing. The gameplay is fun and smooth minus some bugs here and there but i do enjoy playing this every day and the game keeps improving minus the revival cost.,9,The game actually is how I thought it would be. I like the zombies and how you kill them weapons are a bit common but yea... I know the game has many bugs and **** but I still won't get a refund. Why? I see that they try to fix everything and listen to the community. That's enough for me to trust them.

I am looking for this to be a good game but not in one week not in one month but maybe in 6 month this will be a really great game. The game was just released and since the alpha really many things has been changed and added. And just because some things are copied it doesn't mean the game suck. Would you rather use the first phone on earth or a Samsung Galaxy? I would prefer a Samsung. Actually I would give this game 10 points if they would fix the problem with the hackers because the game is fun. But something annoys me: The mainstream cities. You go to a popular city and you see like 10 people in 5 minutes. I know it's actually good if you're not alone but 10 people... If they would hollow out more buildings people will actually travel to different cities and not to the big ones. BTW: I hate to spawn at safe zones.,9,The game is a work in progress far from done. Did my research before buying it. Love the game....  Tired of all the haters. It's got fps or 3 rd. kill or be killed... It's the ultimate survivor game.,9,Still in development has potential !!! Some bugs but really good. New and cool features are coming in the future. More maps will be available. Beware of aggressive players !!! Most people will just kill you without talking first just because of fear !!!,10,This is seriously the best game I've played all year. I have no idea how this masterpiece has a 1.1 average.

Obviously not the War Z. The animation quality is stellar and it makes combat a great pleasure. It's tough but once you have a weapon it really feels like an authentic zombie survival experience. But the thing which most impressed me is how fair the micro transactions are. You get useful upgrades and cosmetic options which I feel are really worth the money. It's great to run around with a firemans helmet and enjoy the game with a couple of friends. Well worth the money for the game and the countless dollars I've spent on revivals hats and virtual food.A few more notes on this game: I LOVE how fall damage works it's so realistic and I like how it makes you think creatively to cross a river. I mean swimming makes no sense the water would probably be infected.Overall a great experience which I would thoroughly recommend to anyone interested in quality fps zombie survival mmos.,7,This game isn't even fully developed.

True you will probably be killed the first 10 times but after a while you will start to get the hang of it and then you can play with maximum fun. Don't fret and be patient greatness comes with patience,8,Remove hackershoppers and the game is perfect.The War Z has many aspects that make me enjoy it far more than i ever did with DayZ. I would definetly recommend it to other people who are fans of  zombie games.,8,The War Z is by all counts an interesting game. The hacker counts are falling the reputation system has started up and some of the long awaited features look to be on the horizon. The game still has the problems faced by similar venues where the gamer population seems to have no interest in working together but if you get a group started things become exponentially more fun.

I don't agree in the last 2 weeks; they have released a patch and for tomorrow another is scheduled. They have finally implemented their anti-hack and are perma banning now.

What spoils the game is that it was released too fast and with too many problems. I hope the developers put everything promised because the game has great potential!,6,This game is not for everyone. It's pretty hardcore. You lose everything when you die and you will die alot. It's not for people who want to jump right in and start killing 300 zombies at once. It's more of a sneak around scavenge return to safety and offload your stuff kind of game.Your worst enemies will be other players. After a few hours you'll figure out how to kill zombiesThis game is not for everyone. It's pretty hardcore. You lose everything when you die and you will die alot. It's not for people who want to jump right in and start killing 300 zombies at once. It's more of a sneak around scavenge return to safety and offload your stuff kind of game. Your worst enemies will be other players. After a few hours you'll figure out how to kill zombies which the combat is about as plain boring and montonous as can be when it comes to zombies. They need to fix the animations and make them accurate. Most of the time when I'm hurt by an attacking zombie it is when the zombie's arms aren't even moving. Also the best way to kill zombies is just ridiculous. You stand still aim at the zombies head and just hold your left mouse button down. Trying to be more accurate with 1 strike at a time or avoid attacks and move in for 1 strike then back out will just get you killed. Second guns are a joke. They're 100% accurate and there's nothing preventing you from easily placing a crosshair on another player. So it's just point click kill with no other factor involved to make you less accurate miss etc. You don't even need to adjust your aim based on distance. Your always 100% steady etc. This is why other players are your biggest and pretty much only threat. It also creates an atmosphere where you need to be extremely patient or you'll die guaranteed because even a 5 year old can pull off a headshot at 300 meters in this game. That's not to say there is no fun to be had in this game. I kind of enjoy the whole super cautious wandering around and trying to scavenge things. It brings out the competitor in me beause the game is extremely harsh. It's fun grouping with others to take on zombies and raid towns. It's even fun playing a bandit that murders anyone who he comes across and takes their crap. The bottom line is that this game has a TON of potential. It's a plain foundation of a game at the moment and if the developers continue to patch/update the game it might just be great one day. The best thing they could do is stop listening to their hardcore forum fanboys who are 90% of their survey repliers want things like 24 hour respawns and 1000000000000 people servers where all you can do is spawn and die... They've built a foundation why not create something worth remembering?,5,It seems the devolopers want to punish the glitchers more then the hackers. This game is ripe full of hacking which defeats the point of even playing at all. I'm a glitcher that never got banned but I've had friends who got banned just to glitch to have a fighting chance against hackers. I have even killed a hackers who have been walling and aim botting by glitching into walls.,5,I bought WarZ in its relatively early days and it was fun it was mostly about avoiding zombies and scavenging to try and find food water and weapons (PvE).

I am giving the game a 5 because I believe in time when the dev team do their job properly and all the features they say will be in it are implemented it will be the best Zombie MMO available. (Thats if they ever add them) So wait before you buy they may never add them.,5,I came into this game with high hopes I have been playing many games in alpha like minecraft and dayz and they have both been amazing experiences so I thought this would be different.

However although I dislike a lot of it I have to admit there are some parts that I really like such as the inventory system the character customization and the option to spawn with your friends when you start a game. I feel this game meant well but was in the wrong hands give it to people like Crytek or Bohemia to finish the job. Overall I would avoid this game until it's out of alpha.,7,LET ME SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. The War Z is a decent game.

If they had Public PVE only servers i would be playing it every single day. I mean dont call it a zombie game if other humans are the greatest threat! Unless you adapt and find a method to play whilst there arent any humans around you its an okay experience. It could be ten trillion times better as a game if it dropped the lone wolf pvp style approach but made it co-op left for dead style sure keep the losing your items upon death feature but add an option for zombie enthusiasts that arent simply looking for just another sandbox call of duty pc game that you hack in. Seriously the co-op a d hackers need fixed and it would be prefect! Enable an option request pvp duel or you cant kill ppl. That way pve-ers can safely encounter pvp'ers. So many better ideas could be implemented than what is already at hand.,10,Game is doing just fine  slow in progress but its getting there   people on steam should of youtube the gameplay first before buying i know  i did  ..... to sum it all up game is great and has alot of potentialits worth every dollar ........... KEEP UP THE GREAT JOB,8,People are way way way to rough on this game. They constantly update and tons of features were added. Plus nobody who reviewed it actually bought it its just a parade of IGNnorant 10 year old fanboys with no life. They say it sucks but if you watch the review they just repeat what IGN said. Give it time. Its very fun. I dont see a problem with the Gold Credits score its not like you canPeople are way way way to rough on this game. They constantly update and tons of features were added.

It provides a good variety of weapons with a varying degree of damage. There is one map at the moment Colorado which provides a variety of terrain and locations with cities towns gas stations and Ski resorts too explore and find loot in.Most server have a max of 50 players with some allowing 100 players.There are plans for more maps with the next planned to release in June the California map. The game is not PvE and has a focus on PvP as well as the zombie aspect I won't lie you will die....a lot.The community is not the greatest but there are players out there who will team up with and provide more communication then the barrel of their gun. There is a marketplace which you can spend in-game currency on which is collected by killing zombies who also give EXP which is used for leveling up and having skills (This is a planned feature the skill system has not been implemented as of this review).You can also buy GC currency with real money to buy items for convenience such as food and drink but you can not buy guns there are a few ammo types available and cosmetic items like hats.You can also buy some melee weapons but these are common in-game. (All purchasable items can be found in-game if you do not wish to use the shop). You can have upto 5 characters with two gameplay modes Normal and Hardcore.In Normal mode when you die you lose all items on the player but keep the character and all its stats (Also skills once implemented) there is also a lockout timer where that player is not use-able right now its at 1 hour but this may change at a later date. Hardcores difference is that when you die you die.You lose your character and can not use it ever again. At the moment there are many features that are missing but are planned for the future they will likely all be in before the end of 2013. If you want to have some fun in a zombie survival MMO for a low price (unless you wish to spend more though it is optional) then you should give WarZ a chance ignore the trolls and haters and look into the game yourself.Make your own decision. If you don't like it there are The Dead Linger and DayZ (Stand-alone) which may meet your zombie needs better but don't simply disregard The WarZ give it a chance....it may surprise you.,6,Well I am a big fan of the game. But the game is far from beeing amazing. The thing is ppl from Hammerpoint say that they listen to us and everything. That's BS! Example: A lot of ppl are angry with the game atm specially because of it price on STEAM. At the Forums there were 20 posts out of 30 of ppl complaining on something. What Sergey does? He post that He listen to us and theWell I am a big fan of the game. But the game is far from beeing amazing. The thing is ppl from Hammerpoint say that they listen to us and everything. That's BS!

He post that He listen to us and the majority of ppl are saying that they agree with what Hammerpoint is doing. REALLY? majority? BS!Oh they say that they answer our e-mails and gives attention to all of us. another big BS. still waiting for an answer on my e-mail 2 weeks so far. About a problem that I've had.This game has problems since day 1 that everybody realized it just as Hammerpoint ppl did but they so far done NOTHING against it. example? Server Hopper. This makes the game even less survival and more pvp than it should. Don't take me wrong I love the pvp in the game. But the Hopping makes ppl just loot and PVP. I can do that on COD without the need of waste time hopping. Me just like many others are still here because we believe tha the changes will come.ppl from Hammerpoint never keep to it promisses. They never release things on the day they say they would. I won't even talk about hacker. Just the fact that Hammerpoint employees are trash when it comes to hack situation.Honesyl I love The War Z. Just not the ppl behind it. I play the game since its first day. Hours and hours daily. with a nice clan. And just like me they are waiting for the day that ppl from Hammerpoint will start doing things right.,9,The War Z is a great game. I have been following it since about 8 months ago. Reading reviews searching for what I could. I also purchased it on Steam when it first released and was shortly taken off. I think the Developers and Creators did a great job. I think the community is where the problem actually was. When I purchased The War Z I understood I was buying a game that wasn't finishedThe War Z is a great game.

I think the Developers and Creators did a great job. I think the community is where the problem actually was. When I purchased The War Z I understood I was buying a game that wasn't finished yet. I didn't care I wanted to play it and test it and be there for the ride but I know that a lot of people don't read the fine print and they join and get upset when they find out it isn't what they think it is. Thats not the developers fault. Thats the customers fault. Its 2013 and we all know that the customer is not always right and we have seen that some customers just want to make a seen to get attention or even a monetary gain. Its the sad truth but moving on. I have seen the updates launch I have seen cooperation from the developers at Hammerpoint Interactive and I have seen improvement in the game play as well as the community. I have played with others as well as played by myself. I have died I have lost money I have gained valuable items and ultimately gained more than I have lost. I see constant updates on their facebook and website informing everyone of important updates. A few months ago I would have agreed that playing this game for long periods of time would have felt like homework because it needed so many improvements but now I can say that playing it for a few hours on end feels quite normal. It has its lag filled moments once in a while but honestly what game hasn't had those moments at least once or twice in their history. Its smooth its fun its a huge area to explore and its got that surprise and suspense element with trusting other players. The War Z requires a rare type of skill for gaming: Judgement... Without good Judgement you will find yourself getting killed constantly by other players. If you can learn to read people and probe for answers and learn to reasonably bluff you will find that you will get what you want way more often. Unfortunately that goes for both sides.,8,Relay fun game  especially with friends . there is still some important things to be fixed . i think this game have a good potential .i believe in this game,8,I'm not here to claim the game is perfect; It's far from that. What I will say is that I have logged almost 200 hours on this game largely with a group of college friends and it is one of the most satisfying MMO experiences I have ever had despite its flaws. Yes the AI is glitched. Yes there are  still some game mechanics that were promised by the developers that aren't in the game.I'm not here to claim the game is perfect; It's far from that.

The developers haven't been as active as they probably should be but I enjoy the game and that is what is most important for me.,8,Firstly comparing this game to DayZ is a non-sequitor since while they are in the same genre they couldn't be much more different. DayZ is a more of a pure survival horror game whilst WarZ is fluffier and generally more user friendly than the Arma II engine which is clunky and outdated. Are there issues in WarZ? Yes. Most of these issues are beta related since it is still in thatFirstly comparing this game to DayZ is a non-sequitor since while they are in the same genre they couldn't be much more different. DayZ is a more of a pure survival horror game whilst WarZ is fluffier and generally more user friendly than the Arma II engine which is clunky and outdated. Are there issues in WarZ? Yes. Most of these issues are beta related since it is still in that phase. If you don't want an unpolished unfinished game don't play WarZ. For those with sour grapes you should have done your research before buying. Once again don't be mad about a game's description if you don't research the game. Steam descriptions aren't always the full story. The game isn't perfect and it won't be for some time but it has come a long way since its alpha release when there was an even tinier map server issues rampant hacking and generally low usability. Give the game a chance if you like survival horror it might just surprise you.,8,Alright so I have taken a tour around the internet and have seen all the hate this game is getting and on some points these people are right the game is broken but in no way is it a waste of money and it also does not cost money to create a clan it is not pay to win the stuff you buy is all optional all fairly easy to find on your own it is all for convenience it's not necessary theAlright so I have taken a tour around the internet and have seen all the hate this game is getting and on some points these people are right the game is broken but in no way is it a waste of money and it also does not cost money to create a clan it is not pay to win the stuff you buy is all optional all fairly easy to find on your own it is all for convenience it's not necessary the marketplace with real money is restricted to mostly cosmetic items and ammunition everything good like night vision and weapons all cost in game money which is fairly hard to get since you only get about 100$  for 5-10 zombies it's a random drop and you need thousands. Sure it has some bugs too but for 2 1/2 months of released developmental I don't think anyone should be complaining  I have also seen hate on the controls and to be honest  the question I might ask these people is are you retarded ?  It's the same standard controls as most controls used in most shooters with the slight exceptions of the added features you would expect in a game like this. Last but not least to those who say this is a DayZ rip off there's one thing I have to say... and that is sure it has similar elements but those are expected in a standard zombie apocalypse game and to be honest I would consider Day Z to a piece of **** because honestly it's not that good I can't say The War Z is much better but I can honestly say half the people who hate on this game have never played it never will and are just being fan boys about DayZ if you wish to purchase this game go ahead you have nothing to lose I find it extremely fun if you have a nice group of friends to play with but until then shut the **** up with the hate give it some more time and most things will be fixed and if you have seen all the people saying there are thousands of hackers I have ran into 3 since I started playing and those were before they banned those 2000 some odd players they might not all have been hackers but it did get rid of a lot of them. The overall gameplaywww.metacritic.comf 10 if you have some friends if not it's slightly less enjoyable but still fun these games always need a couple friends to go around with.,7,Despite the overwhelming drama surrounding the developers the game is actually quite fun. In a time where the Internet is king many players seem to have taken to cluster bombing the ratings and reputation of titles based on opinions rather than experience. This game has a lot of potential. A LOT. The developers just need to completely fix their PR towards unhappy customers.

The game isn't bad at all but I do fear the Pay-to-Win aspect that may evolve.Games take from each other all the time and this is just another example of it. I have played both DayZ and The WarZ. They are different games.  I like them both! Cant we all get along?,9,If your not a hate-wagon follower or a dayz fanboy and you have archived some grade of maturity in your life feel free to read me   If you are a blind hate bandwagon follower 15 years old or a day z fanboy go right ahead and rate my review down walk away and be happy  After all this game isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

While i do agree that the game often goes into directions that the playerbase doesnt want this game to go the game at its core is fun lots of fun.. The pure insolence that all this so called "Professional and Mature" game magazines have delivered here simply makes me want to rip my hair out  It should be 100% clear that this game is far from complete. Since the big hate outbreak that some people started out of pure self-intrest the game has improved itself over and over again engine optimazations have been done the melee is finally challenging the world has been improved houses have been opened some textures have been enhanced and so on; And it keeps on going week after week day after day it becomes a more and more immersive experience. With my gaming knowledge starting at the 16 bit era i can honestly tell you that you should give this game a honest try and bring the senseless hate to a halt. Im also telling you that im in deep love with day z and that im eagerly awaiting standalone... After all i think two great games are better then one right ?The developers seem to have alot of mercy with the hackers.. It usually goes like this person "a" hacks gets reported the developers take a look at the screenshots that fairfight does of the persons UI wich detects and shows all signs of ESP and person "a" finally gets banned! Person "a" cant believe it spams the forum and writes a support ticket and cries to everyone on how bad this game is gets unbanned  and the process repeats.  And so do the simple haters or fanboys that keep on scaring people off that wanted to buy the game  It is sad to see it with a clear mind it is sad how overpopulated the internet is with young raging players and immaturity.. It is 15 bucks it IS a fair price. Im playing this game since it came out and havent been banned nor kicked nor warned once... Dont listen to those people and give it a try! It really isnt as bad... I am also sorry for those people who really got banned without a reason and i want to make myself clear that i am not talking to them or want to offend them in any way... Thats enouth of my wobble so pick it up  (or dont),10,Been playing since release in Oct 16th and have been having lots of fun! still more stuff to be added but the devs listen to the community and the updates are regular and add great new stuff :) 10/10 because it has so much replayability and has a bright future. Don't listen to all the negative reviews they're just getting caught up in all the drama surrounding WarZ,10,Well I have voted 10 because I really think I've got what I payed for. The game has it unique chaotic atmosphere of survival. Not all the features are available yet but devs are releasing up to 3 patches a week!I would definitely suggest the game to Zombie fans!,8,So I have been looking at this game for a while. I watched a ton of videos about how to play and what to expect. I'm not the biggest fan of Zombies and can't really stick with man MMO's other than WoW. However I gotta say I just bought this and its not half bad. I mean it was only $15. Which I know for some people is a lot of money. Also in regards to principle yes I'm aware of whatSo I have been looking at this game for a while. I watched a ton of videos about how to play and what to expect.

Which I know for some people is a lot of money. Also in regards to principle yes I'm aware of what happened at its release. I'm aware of what happened. I can't say that I agree with it nor support it. However aside from that the game has improved GREATLY. The graphics are much more crisp. The lighting can be spectacular. Now there is the cash shop however its really not pay to win. I have just a good a chance to get a drop on you as you have on me. A few well placed shots and poof your stuff is mine :)I think that Hammerpoint got the message. Both from the players and Steam. They have apologized for how they went about their practices. Look is that game worth a zero score...no. Not even close. Is it worth a ten. Nope. However is it worth your time. Most definitely yes. Looting is challenging and its rewarding to find items. Much of what they promised is now in the game. Outside of cars and any vehicles which I wish there was. Walking everywhere is pain. Also there are a lot of areas that really don't have much going on so it can get a little slow at times. However once you get the idea of where to loot and the battles surrounding those areas you'll appreciate those places. Also yes when you die you lose your stuff. I like that they kept that. It makes it a much more tense game at higher population servers. Its worth your time trust me its not "Battleship The Video Game" bad. And that game cost $60 on release day.... It's no Sim City. And with a few friends its really really fun. Hope that helps. Have fun and see you out there.,10,I am a frequent player of The War Z and to be honest I do enjoy the game a lot. I do die a lot as well but that is besides the point. I may not agree on how situations are handled however I still take my hat off to Sergey and the rest of the team. The game has a lot going for it and in time it will get better. I for one can defiantly not pull such a game like this off and I am sure thatI am a frequent player of The War Z and to be honest I do enjoy the game a lot.

The game has a lot going for it and in time it will get better. I for one can defiantly not pull such a game like this off and I am sure that there are not may other that can. My main point to this would be that WE the COMMUNITY is making or braking this game WE have had plenty of opportunities to give our input on the game and what WE would like to have and so far have they not made some of the changes that WE asked for? (Less players on servers more Zombies more loot) How long do you think this can go on before it all falls apart.. What I say here might be insignificant to a lot of people but I would like to ask just to ease up a bit..This game was created with the basic idea of Zombie survival and the COMMUNITY is shaping the game to the way they want it.,10,Very fun gameplay with zombie hords and good gfx. There are a lot of Player all Server are filled up and you can make Clans and Play with your friends. 1-3 more months and this game will be rocking the world!,10,I love this game i don't know why people are so hateful on this game. It has a lot of potential maybe you guys are missing the fact that it is only in beta. It is an amazing game.,8,War Z is a really good game in the last stages of development there are some issues that the dev team is working on fixing and a lot of people do not understand or care about the issues they are having which explains the large number of e-hate. Also School holidays is on now so a lot of kids have nothing better to do then hate on things they don't understand.

If the game is given a chance it will become a great iconic mmo that will last for many years as there is still a lot of content still unreleased in the form of maps class skills and methods of transport. I vote 8/10,10,i pre-ordered this game  glad i did you people need to stop sucking on the balls of dayz  arma  leave us the hell alone. if you actually played the game or spoke to some of its real players maybe you would have a different opinion but no you are all small minded fools being led a merry dance. just get on with it you play your game and we will play ours. all warz haters are dayz fanboysi pre-ordered this game  glad i did you people need to stop sucking on the balls of dayz  arma  leave us the hell alone. if you actually played the game or spoke to some of its real players maybe you would have a different opinion but no you are all small minded fools being led a merry dance. just get on with it you play your game and we will play ours. all warz haters are dayz fanboys typical ain't it trying to get the game to fail. i got news for ya AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.,9,These negative reviews are ridiculous guys. The War Z is a really good game and I've had some of the most intense firefights in my 26 years of gaming in this game.

Is it true that their Steam page was copied and pasted from their website with features that weren't in the game yet? Yep. HasThese negative reviews are ridiculous guys.

However the game's zombies are really fun and there are lots of them. The PvP is amazing. Pick this game up and give it a try yourself and ignore these RhinoCrunch trolls and the bandwagon of DayZ fanboys. This game will get your heart racing sometimes :),10,I do not understand the hater of this game. The War Z is still developing game and owners trying to make the game better. I believe it is %100 worth to buy.(do not listen to the hater),10,The game has potential and is very enjoyable i found myself enjoying it more then any other survival game. I would honestly recommend  this to all my friends.,5,Its honestly isn't that bad. Its pretty fun when you're online with a group of friends. I really wasn't expecting much at this stage of the game because I clearly understood the terms "Alpha" and "Beta" which the other 90% don't. The greater majority of people who have rated it negatively haven't even played the game so overall I do recommend the game but to those who are sceptical dueIts honestly isn't that bad.

This game has a lot of hype. More bad than good I would say especially just looking at these reviews. A lot of the negative hype are day z fan boys. Sure great no worries. What many of these posts don't realize is that the game is still in beta. The price was not reduced to 15 it has always been 15. Anyone that spent more gets in game currency equal to what they spent and other perks. Nothing game changing things like private stronghold servers and such. I have played the game through alpha and into beta alpha was rough. It was hacker plagued. The hackers have been reduced and now that it is launching through steam and with the "new anti-hack" out. Which I think is the same anti-hack but with the consequences of hacking a game on steam attached. You kids won't want to lose your steam account will you? The threat of hackers should be greatly reduced. To kozzy420 or anyone that bought the game through steam I'm not sure how it shows the game but any research into the game like 5 seconds into google and you could figure out it is in beta. And come on for 15 bucks you could do a lot worse! I have paid 60 bucks for crappier x box games that I spend less time with than I have with war z. Either way I like war z better than day z at the moment. I will try the day z stand alone but will definitely keep my account going. This is a good game with a ton of negative hype but don't listen to the people saying they are rushing the game. The game is in beta so it is still a work in progress they have already tested skill trees but have found they need more work to be in the game so they said they will not have them done this year. Does that sound like rushing? No it sounds like a smart choice by them to not rush something as integral as a skill tree. The baby gamers of the new generation need to suck it up and clan up. Get together with some people hold down a town or go explore if you want. We had six of us build a stronghold in the clearview small grocery the other night then call the server out. Told them we had all sorts of good loot which we did. All of us fully armed with plenty of ammo barricades for our building all had body armor and helmets. We held it down for a good hour and a half with lots of action. There was maybe two to three separate groups that showed up. They were doing most of the fighting at first then the winners tried to take us down but they were hard pressed. They had a sniper up on a hill with no shot on us and kept poking their heads into the market to try to get us. They did get two of us I got two kills a buddy got two as well. We lost another to the sniper as he tried to loot. We sent him out after we killed a bunch in the town. He came back in and we were able to loot a lot of the stuff. We had to use another barricade in the middle of the street so the sniper couldn't kill us as we looted. It was different and it was a lot of fun. Watch a short clip of part of the battle. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cso0UPFGGsY&feature;=youtu.be Here you can watch us celebrating the holiday. http://youtu.be/5VUxGgvRfH8 Here you can watch a zombie montage the night stuff isn't great. Hard to film at night. Need night vision! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53C5ohVx_n4&feature;=youtu.be The game is what you make it but you can't survive on your own for too long. Only a matter of time clan up it is an mmo in that sense. For 15$ this game is a bargain.  It was always 15! Not a quick cash grab as the haters say. Don't waste your money? I'm sure almost all of you have wasted 15 dollars on more. You don't need gc to play the game as many say. It helps speeds your revival time for about the same cost of a baseball bat. You can't buy guns. You can buy a very limited supply of ammo. The key though as I said you need to clan up groups of three are decent for going around but the more the merrier! Enjoy the holidays!,8,People are ridiculous and just being dayz fans. This game is a work in progress and many of the arguments they use are no longer valid like server population and the amount of zombies.

Ultima Online hands down funnest game I played growing up and I wish more games these days were like that where you can lose everything you have worked to get in the blink of an eye. Too many games these days are designed to work with you to accomplish things instead of make you work for it. Just so new readers know I am reading through the reviews and like 70% of what I am reading they have already fixed or implemented as they said they would. Such as bugs and majority of hackers banned and the 100player private servers.... This game is a breath of fresh air when compared to games like WoW BF CoD Diablo Crysis and whatever other popular games that I play but just can't really enjoy to it's fullest because they are simply too easy and I feel like I am getting my hand held along the way. I love the adrenaline that pumps through my system at the thought of hearing footsteps running around or especially seeing that guy walk around the corner with an assault rifle or hearing that crack of a sniper... There are bugs still granted it is expected for how new it is and they are still working on it. There are several designs about it that are similar to DayZ but most games are like all other games to be frank. Guildwars LoL WoW Dota SW etc.etc. all similar playstyles and all got ideas from other games. Overall great game great experience even though I do get pissed off when I get killed after I spent so much time on it and lose all my stuff before I can get to my global inventory. Chances are most people hate this game because it is similar to a game they have already played heard rumors it is a rip off to another game or they just don't like to work at video gaming.,5,I purchased War Z back in October and I ordered the Legendary addition.

Here are the major issues: Hackers DeV team clashing with their fragile community features and updates are NOT being flushed out in a more organized and reasonable fashion Hammerpoint has been pulling off a lot of questionable moves and comments that have many in the community extremely worried. What Hammerpoint needs to do from here now is take a serious look at themselves and see what they are doing right and what they are doing wrong. Communication to the community on the War Z forums should be more important than third party gaming news websites interviews.. yes.. we know about those. Second they need to crack down on these hackers. Go after the source not just the problem. Start going after these sites that are creating and SELLING these hacks. Isn't it against the law to illegitimately hurt another business and their products? Then from their they need to get organized.. big time! They need to quit dishing out small patches and start going big add NEW things.. Like how Minecraft does it. Then patch what gets broken later. This game has potential still to be great. There is still time for them to fix this and they have to start NOW!,8,There is a lot of potential in the game. I think that the game is fun but just needs some more time to develope. Mistakes have been made by the developers but I still have faith in them.,5,The game is rather fun.  Some prefer DayZ still... but I never liked DayZ much.  The feel of the controls on WarZ are much better in my opinion.  This game is essentially a modified version of War Inc.  Thats a good and bad thing.  The zombies are a bit more realistic and move the same speed whether inside or outside of a building.  They also don't sprint around like crazy like in DayZ.The game is rather fun.

Thats a good and bad thing.  The zombies are a bit more realistic and move the same speed whether inside or outside of a building.  They also don't sprint around like crazy like in DayZ.  Though some of them DO move fast but not faster than your own sprint.  In the long run though they are still pretty dumb.  My biggest problems are actually the way the company acts with its consumers.  They pick and choose when to be nice.  They can be enthusiastic if its something good.  But if theres something bad going on or something bad they have to say then they twist it to not be their fault. There are many features that are yet to come.  Originally they had a set list of things guaranteed to be in the game.  But they have since made a "Foundation release" with absolutely no plans for an "official release" and still the game isn't complete.  This leaves one to wonder what their plans actually are.  It seems highly plausible that they are just doing everything they can to save their own butts.  When in reality if they were just honest and kept working hard they would be protected anyway. In terms of gameplay itself I am most disappointed about the amount of PvP.  Its advertised as a zombie survival game and yes other players will be your BIGGEST threat.  But so far its been just about the ONLY threat.  Its so far more of a first person shooter where you find your own guns.  I still have hope that this game and company will get better.  I have some fun when its late at night and hardly anyone else is online.  The rare encounters are more appealing when you have the chance to see someone and go the other direction in oppose to high populations where you are just killed on sight and you have nowhere to run because you're surrounded by players who most likely just spawned.,6,1 should be clear - this game isn't finished product now.  It's still alpha/beta even is they call it "foundation release". This is main reason for so many negative ratings. So if you want polished product - wait 6 months. But even in it's current state it's not that bad just missing a lot of features developers have announced. My rating is for current state.

Bay or not - go check gameplay videos on youtube and decide - do you like it or not don't listen to those negative comments. There are lot of false accusations or things that are already solved. Devs work hard and patch game every week or even more often so problems from previous weeks could be already solved.,8,Even if this game has bugsglitches and unfair player killing.this game is actually not that bad there coming up with more updates more guns more items and more maps.And who couldforget the character customization.It just had a bad start.,8,Most of the negative reviews for Infestation:SS are due to a buggy (and arguably incomplete) launch of the game. The game has gotten much better since then. You'll either love or hate this game. I love it. It's very challenging an not very noob friendly but once you get the hang of it it's a rush.

And with the developers working hard to improve it it has the potential to be a 10 out of 10 (that is after they add vehicles give a PVE area and extra water for noobs and get punkbuster to quit kicking people). IDK if the PB kicking issue is the game or just PB but that is the only major bug I've had trouble with. Give it a chance it's addictive!,10,Love this game just waiting for private servers once i get my own server then my life will be nothing but War Z.  I'm kinda getting bored with the pvp aspect of it atm not that i die alot just that i would like my own server to actually be able to kill zombies with a gun w/o worrying about a bandit hearing me.,10,This game is just excellent. I played DayZ before and then I heard about this game when I stopped playing DayZ. I was excited to see how it were then I first thought this game was going to be a fail because it is a "MMO" and then my friend convinced me to play the game because it wouldn't suck. There am I playing this game enjoying it but Hammerpoint should listen more to theThis game is just excellent. I played DayZ before and then I heard about this game when I stopped playing DayZ.

There am I playing this game enjoying it but Hammerpoint should listen more to the community. They don't accept bad critics about the game but they need to accept it in order to make the game better. Why this game is considered a MMO: because of the Skill Tree. You can learn new skills (unimplemented yet). I don't know how it will work but I think WarZ didn't need that. When I first played this I kept getting killed and then I was like "F*CK I DIED WHY DID YOU DO THIS MOTHERF*CKER?" but then I just realise that the game is still fun even when you die. I kept laughing at how the guy killed me which makes this a good game. MY FINAL REVIEW: Good game if you want to try it out ask your friend that bought it for a Guest Key. That way you'll not spend any money on the game if you don't like it.,10,Yes the game isn't finished.  Yes they show features on there website that haven't been implemented.

Given all that it is still the most fun I have had playing an online game in years. Sure other players will kill you in a heart beat.  Sometimes you will be spawn killed.  Most of the hacker problems have been fixed but you might still be killed by one once in a while. It's a survival game.  Don't trust anyone.  Toe up to any single zombie and bash him in the head even with the lowly flashlight and you will win.  More than one zombie after you then run.  Scavenge food and drinks you will need them.  Scavenge armor weapons and bigger backpacks they are quite rare. Don't run around with you flashlight out and telling everyone where you are  Don't run around out in the open in daylight.  People are more dangerous than zombies.  All in all the game is a flat out rush. try it. Ignore all the day-Z fanboys.,10,I don't understand why everyone hate this game. I could even say it has the same quality as DayZ and probably a bit better. The graphics are great the game server does not lag at all. Of course there has some problem with releasing the game on Steam with some features that are not yet in the game but the game is great as it is right now. I haven't met any bugs any hacker and onlyI don't understand why everyone hate this game.

Of course there has some problem with releasing the game on Steam with some features that are not yet in the game but the game is great as it is right now. I haven't met any bugs any hacker and only one glitch. But I know that the hackers are really here but Ive never been killed by a hacker. The game has a great potential and I really want to see how they will have implemented the features they announced when they released the very first version of the game. They don`t work really fast maybe because of their lack of experience that some people think they have but at least they deliver what I paid for when I bough my Legend package. You may read a lot of negative critics here or on other sites but these are only DayZ fanboy who doesn't want to see DayZ be forgotten. Also remember that when someone don't have a problem with it they don't always write a critic about it because they think that someone else already did and the score is high. Buy the game if you like zombies game it is cheaper than DayZ right now and totally worth the 15$.,9,War Z is one of the few games of this genre and is still in development.The game is better every day and many of these negative scores are the alpha and the beta of the game the game has improved a lot.Many fixes were made many bugs fixed and the game is getting great.,9,This is a great game in the making it does have bugs and glitches but I have spent MANY hours and I have had a great time.

Game is not a usual mmo. Its throw a bunch of people into a world with the best resources in a few places on the map zombies all over and then see what happens. What i have seen so far is some amazing pvp. Huge fire fights in the middle of the woods. Killing people then trying to take loot before the other players show up. Also working together to clear major zombie areas to gather loot. I have not been hacked in over a week and that hacker failed anyhow. The paided items are horrible items. I find better its in a few minutes. People complaining about this game dont seem to know how to play games like this same concept as WOW or any other mmo. If someone is camping an area leave that area. Its easy to run away and not get shot in a game full of trees. Yes trees do stop bullets.,10,This game is amazing the graphics style is excellent and the amount of guns should keep you entertained for a while. 10/10 Has no bugs and no hackers. Perfect game thankyou Hammerpoint.,9,Please read all the rage reviews in here and tell me how many of them actually talk about the actual game in general and not small features or faulty details. NONE. That's right. They aren't reviews but just haters that probably haven't played the game for more than an hour. The game has had a growing community since before the Steam release for a reason. I have played this game after itPlease read all the rage reviews in here and tell me how many of them actually talk about the actual game in general and not small features or faulty details. NONE. That's right. They aren't reviews but just haters that probably haven't played the game for more than an hour. The game has had a growing community since before the Steam release for a reason. I have played this game after it was released as an alpha to the general public and I can firmly say that have never had so much fun in such a long time. First this game is not for everyone. It is an MMO FPS SURVIVAL PVP Zombie game which focus on PvP. The game is meant to be rough. No party system or anti friendly fire for example gives realism to the game. A death penalty of 4 hours per character and lost of all carried items (lootable by other players) creates a survival of the fittest like environment full of tension and gratification at the same time. The War Z look and sound very good with many details that gives incredible realism to the environment. Is the only game that I've played in a long time that can urge both emotions of great joy or sorrow by the same system. Hear a gun shot and ether you hide/run for your life or you get filled with valor rushing to find the conflict. This game is hardcore very hardcore you could lose hours of farming in an instant just because for example you got killed by some stalker that waited till you got distracted with a zombie but you could also cut hours by executing similar strategies. This is not COD or similar games. You have to think where to go how to get there unnoticed and most importantly look carefully at your surroundings. You have to keep moving in order to find food and drink to stop hunger or thirst which can eventually kill you thus preventing camping for long periods. You can run by yourself or hunt loot or players by joining a clan. I have personally experienced many moments of tension happiness and fear that I will never forget. Felt Incredible joy after killing very farmed players or finding extremely rare items followed by total fear and/or sorrow by encounters with other players. The global inventory a place where you can store items for latter use without fear of losing them has become a memory storage of those moments. In terms of content and delivery developers are constantly listening to the community improving on many aspects of the game and giving life to community ideas. The game has changed so much since the Alpha which can only be explained by its fast development. The War Z as a game has technically improved over its source game idea (DayZ) and over its source game engine (War inc) in many ways. So don't get fooled by people who say that the game is just a rip off or some modification of another game/engine. However it is also technically far from perfect. Glitches malfunctions and in some cases lack of details or basic functionality are present in the game. These has been slowly disappearing but some are still present and can affect the gaming experience for some players. In conclusion this is a very challenging entertaining and fun game that blast players with great tension and emotions. It is not technically exceptional but has demonstrated growing improvements over time with one of the best community-pleasing developers group that I have ever seen. If you don't believe what I say just look for online stream shows at Twitch.tv or any other site and look at the player's face for the reason why this game is so good.,10,i have fun playing is that not what matters? its not a scam ignor the trolls they just gota hate for hates sake ..................................................................................................................................................................................,9,This game is great it is the money hungry CEO that is ruining the game.

Scout gets a vantage point over town. Team of two approaches the town from the east. Team of two approaches town from west. Scout calls enemy positions. Team one assaults and push enemy into ambush setup by team two. Collect loot move to next town. A lot of fun and stratgy comes out of this game.,8,This is a good game with a company that is really bad at communicating to it's customers. There are a lot of really cool upcoming features. As of right now aside from DayZ (which is a different play style) there are no other games like this. Take it or leave it.,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.

Currently DOTA 2 is 30 dollars and is in Beta or you can "View" it for free. I do not agree with how it was posted that there would be all this stuff like a skill tree you could drive cars and this and that But as always when you get an uproar of people feeling like they got cheated from oh well there was supposed to be this cool thing. Chill out they will come. its like the whole up to 100 people per server. A lot of people complained because it was only around 50. It did state "UP TO". What I'm trying to say is for the state of this game it really is good one of my friends who has played dayz said that he has enjoyed this better and its much easier to get into. Just give it a chance and I'm sure most of the people being vocal are probably mad because they can't get a grasp on how to play the game. We have been so babied in the last 5-10 years on what it expected out of a game. It is usually I need to start out with a good weapon I can't die within an hour...well here there are no guarantee on what will happen you might be spawned for 3 minutes and still die. It may be zombies it may be another player.  That's the point of the game use your wits absolutely nothing will be handed to you on this game you have to scavenge. If getting handed things is what you expect in a real life scenario no matter what disaster it may be you are sadly mistaken. You need to work to survive!  I really hope this helps people who are on the edge because of a bunch of people are mad because they cant  survive. The game is still kinda buggy but it's still not completely finished. When it is this will be an absolutely wonderful game! Sorry for any bad grammar i just woke up lol.,8,Great game so far getting better every week. Don't listen to all the rage I've played since day one Alpha never seen a hacker rarely seen glitches. I warmly recommend this game to everyone!,10,All the negatives are being exaggerated greatly. This game has much more potential than DayZ and is already a more fun game. It's not easy game for noobies but if you do minimal research you should be fine. I do agree however that Hammerpoint should have waited a few weeks to release the game to Steam. As of the next 2 weeks they will be implementing huge amount of content to the game.All the negatives are being exaggerated greatly.

do you like HUGE persistent worlds? do you like pvp? do you like pve? do you want to have the choice of either or?(private servers will be out soon and there's PLENTY of people willing to have Role Playing PVE and PVP dedicated servers and allow you in) do you like a challenge? do you like making challenges for other players? do you like to roleplay (not just play a character in an MMO)? do you like to explore? this may be the game for you but keep in mind you must be very patient not just with the development but also with playing the game in general. don't just run out there and expect a large call of duty world. your life is precious in this game as you have a lockout if you die (don't worry there are 5 character slots and you can always save one for a hardcore character. he loses his skills but you get to play as much as you like) you are able to spend real money on game things that are convenient but don't give you any real advantage. for instance at the moment (could possibly change) you can spend 50GC (1$=125ishGC) to revive a dead character sooner (convenient not really an advantage) or get some meds or ammo (again convenient but by no means an advantage). for the best experience in game it could be best to play with a group. if you can not find a trusting group online or in real life friends you may try to join one of the many many clan's. these can lead up to some really amazing and fun times. one of my favorite experiences was when about 24 of us were running through a server to waste weapons before they wiped the inventories. give it a shot. i won't blame someone for not liking this game but i freaking love it and am looking forward to even MORE content to come.,10,Fun lot of stress but we have to play with friends for more survivability! Dont believe rage comment they dont know how to play and this game will be improve by devs.,10,The only people that votes this game so low are dayz fanboys that wish to see any other zombie survival game similar to dayz fail and noobs that die from bandits (they then blame hackers). I play bandit in game and I love it when whenever I kill a noob they will then yell out "HACKER"!.. haha.. But most of the haters are dayz fanboys. Seriously guys stick to your dayz.The game is notThe only people that votes this game so low are dayz fanboys that wish to see any other zombie survival game similar to dayz fail and noobs that die from bandits (they then blame hackers). I play bandit in game and I love it when whenever I kill a noob they will then yell out "HACKER"!.. haha.. But most of the haters are dayz fanboys. Seriously guys stick to your dayz.The game is not terribly buggy. I've been playing alot and only once or twice I have come across a glitch where I would accidentally go through a wall.. Other than that gameplay is not that bad. Those that say that the game is filled with bugs to the point where the game feels broken is obviously lying and trying to make people hate the game.,9,Unfortunately a lot of people are not rating the game itself and are instead rating it's premature release. When I purchased the game I was directed to a forum page that explained it was a foundation release and a lot of the features were not out. And as I actually pay attention I didn't feel cheated and bought it anyway. It has a lot of potential and can be very fun at times.

And as I actually pay attention I didn't feel cheated and bought it anyway. It has a lot of potential and can be very fun at times. What I've enjoyed most is some of the elaborate traps people have set up for me. It's rare to get a laugh out of being killed but sometimes I have to tip my hat to the bad guy. Unfortunately the game was rushed and needs a lot of polish. One downside like so many other games is hackers. I have not ran into a lot but loosing all your stuff when you die makes hacking even more frustrating. If it was more than $20+ I might have been disappointed but the uniqueness of it and the fact it was $13 means I'm happy with the purchase. They have also released 2 updates in the 3 days I've owned it so at least their working on it.,10,The game is amazing!!! I have played since day 1 of alpha. The people that are raging about the game just dont know how to play a zombie survival. I played day z  and War Z makes day z look like crap. War Z is only getting bigger and better. i cant wait for the upcoming features,10,Even though i only have guest passes i was in production before dayz and statistics show that more people are hackers in dayz than in warz making warz having a more fun aspect about it i really recomend this game my friends and i play this all the time. All these people that areposting are dayz fanboys. I bet half them have not even played the game. This game is a buy.,10,Best game ever end of story.,9,This game is fantastic! The only problem is that you have to wait for an hour to play againbut the game is real cool!I like the graphicsthe controlling and I think this game is better than DayZ,5,It had potential. Unfortunately Hammerpoint never listened to their fan base and milked what they could from micro transactions without fixing the issues they should've focused on.,10,The game is still work in progress but is absolutely worth purchasing at its price. Despite it being a raging troll magnet it's definitely worth checking out. You get what it is; a zombie survival game and more and more features are being added. I truely love this game.,10,Good game.  Now raw but has great potential.Pre order the alpha stage. Package survivor. Was pleased with everything but that's the price you promised not previously done so in the end overpaid.,10,This is a awesome game!Deserves a better note he is still in development the developers have been working hard and always releasing updates and improvements. Stopping scams  this game have a great idea and a great future! Congratulations to the staff and the developers of the game do not be discouraged and keep up the great work!,9,Sergey Titov did it again. The only reason I'm not giving it a 10/10 is because it isn't as WINNER as Big Rigs or Remington Big Buck Trophy Hunt but it's certainly the most WINNER game out this year. Congratulations Titov and may we all be WINNER!,10,The game can be categorized as a simulation and not action game. This is more like The Walk Dead universe and not the guns a blazing like the Left 4 Dead series. This game is a MMO game with features of trading collection of items cooperative play. This game is $15 USD however it uses free-to-play (or aka micro-transaction) strategies to pay for its online servers' maintenance costs.The game can be categorized as a simulation and not action game.

You find yourself without food water or companions. So you make your way to the nearest town. You look around for food and water avoiding zombies since you don't have any weapons. You find lots of food and a gun. As you are scavenging the market place you find another survivor. She says she's hungry and you give her some of your food. She says thanks and goes on her way. You decide to check the back alley for supplies survivor you meet earlier is there... pointing a gun at you. She orders you to drop your back pack and supplies. You need that food there isn't anything left in this town and the next town is miles away. You still have the gun you found earlier in your underneath your shirt in the front. What do you do? Do you let her take all your supplies and hopefully be able to make it to the next town? Or do you kill her? In desperation you take out your gun and kill her before she kills you. Then you hear lots of zombies heading your way it must have been the sound of the gun shots. You take what you can and race out of town for safety while shooting your way out. Now you have no bullets. On to the next town. Hopefully it will be a better day tomorrow. The above is what happens to you in the game but I wrote it in story form.,10,Great game Like Demon Souls with GUNS! I love how hardcore this game is I have killed and been killed many times lost tons of loot and found some cool stuff. Now this game is a sandbox FPS zombie survival - EVERYTHING I wanted.

LOL Its all part of the game now shut up and play.,9,In the launch the game sucked it had a lot of hackers and bugs! But actually the game has improved a lot with the Punkbuster  which make the hackers stay out of the game! The game worth your money!,8,Im playing the WarZ for 2 or 3 Months now. And i just must admit the game isnt that bad as it is shown at the media. Its a lot of fun to play with friends. Sureley the game is not everyones taste cause it just doenst fit the MMO Mainstream. Many hundrethousands of people play the game and still have fun. Im sure if they implement the Features announced the game will even geht better.,10,I ve played DayZ for about 2 hours before the ugliness of the game made me quit. This on the other hand looks ok and is still improving. Granted there was a PR **** up with the steam release and it still needs a lot of work bit the game has a lot of potential and certainly deserves better the the current user score seems to suggest,8,I purchased this game back in October for it Alpha release.  I was taking a risk that I definitely do not regret.  The game decently solid as of now.  While there may be a few bugs the game is overall fun to play and is definitely worth the buy.  Regarding the whole "missing features" bit the features listed are either planned or are in-game already.  This is nothing to be worriedI purchased this game back in October for it Alpha release.

Regarding the whole "missing features" bit the features listed are either planned or are in-game already.  This is nothing to be worried about and these features will come in time.  the only negative part of the game other than minimal bugs is the community.  Many people just shoot on sight and do not consider teaming up.  If you want to play a good open-world zombie game:  this is the game for you.,10,Só nao é melhor porque tem muito hacker... e repito sinto vergonha de 90% deles serem BR....,10,I'll tell you guys why i'll give the game 10/10 On the beginning when the game was released. It indeed had a lot of problems. People could use hacks false information on steam. I did buy the game on the release date.

Indeed it was annoying but even with all those problems.  Hammerpoint Interactive" did not give up. They tried to improve the game with everything they could e.g adding a punk buster. I'm playing the game as we speak. You certainly can see the improvement,10,I don't understand why people would compare this game to Day Z. They might be in the same environment share gameplay or something else BUT YOU ALL BOUGHT COD:BOII similarities never stood in your way before why are they so important now?

Also I think that reddit posts and all the frauds against War Z is Day Z developers' fault.TL;DR give the guys a break,9,I pre-ordered this game and I've been loving it ever since the October 15th alpha release! It's received a lot of negative reviews because people didn't do their research and thus failed to understand that it was a game in development even though it was CLEARLY marked as Alpha on the purchase page we were notified before purchase in the FAQ and that we would get early access compared toI pre-ordered this game and I've been loving it ever since the October 15th alpha release!

Items were wiped when going from alpha to beta and all the kiddies and trolls complained that they'd spent soooo long on looting items. That's not even what the game is about... 9/10 plenty of patches and new features coming in 2013! Get on it guys and gals!,6,The game should have never been released on Steam I'll give it that.  But this game is not a complete game ether the Dev's need to come out and admit to that and then start fixing it.  If they can do what they promise when people bought the Alpha pre-release then they will be solid.,9,I've played this game for a couple of months now and have been amazed at some of the advancements it has made over its life cycle. I thoroughly enjoy this game on a daily basis alone with friends any time.

Would I recommend this game? If you can get over a few bugs here and there and a few of the inevitable hackers... I would most certainly recommend this to you.,9,The game is actually really fun the PVP is awesome..... haven't had this much fun in a shooter in a while to be honest. I got about 11 of my friends/family playing every night and we have a good time. hacker bans have caused an uproar int he community so i wouldn't be surprised if they've all teamed up to write bad reviews and give the game a bad name.The game is unfinished... butThe game is actually really fun the PVP is awesome..... haven't had this much fun in a shooter in a while to be honest.

I think many people just misunderstanding this game and about the failed advertising of the dev. But really if this game is not your type of game then don't play it let's the other have fun because you guys are ruining the game!,9,Yes this game has its flaws. But I have had so much fun with it that I have to rate it at least a 9. I bought it before the steam launch and I do not regret it one bit. I had been looking at DayZ videos looking at how cool it was but did not want to purchase ArmA II: CO to play it. I decided to wait for the DayZ standalone.

I got banned for the first time buying it but I bought another one so it works out well.,10,this game has been a blast since day 1 Very fun group co-op play had many exciting and amusing gun fights between groups of survivors and while scavenging on my own.

Los desarrolladores van frecuentemente sacando actualizaciones y mejoras que haran en el futuro que sea uno o el mejor juego multijugador de Zombies que existen. La Relación calidad/precio es enorme. Solo 15$.,10,Great game from an indie developer not polished but I like to see it as a work in progress and I've already got more than 10x worth out of the cheap game cost,10,All the hate is just some DayZ Fan boys hating The WarZ The warZ is just like jumping right in to the strawberry river its the best thing can ever play ok  thoe it has som bugs and glitches but SERUSLY. its the best game ever made Im a real fan of The elder scrolls and i need to say bye bye to Skyrim because Im going to play The WarZ. i promisse you its worth evry single penny!!.  byAll the hate is just some DayZ Fan boys hating The WarZ The warZ is just like jumping right in to the strawberry river its the best thing can ever play ok  thoe it has som bugs and glitches but SERUSLY. its the best game ever made Im a real fan of The elder scrolls and i need to say bye bye to Skyrim because Im going to play The WarZ. i promisse you its worth evry single penny!!.  by the way dont trow hate on it because u died 10 seconds after you spawned (if thats true then Ur a EXTREMELY NOOB) just make a new character and give it a new chance. The WarZ  10/10 Easy! And Remember its just in Beta now....,10,I thoroughly enjoy this game. It has had many ups and down along the road and has had flamers the entire way who simply did not want to credit someone whom they feel stole the idea when they simply wanted to make something to be enjoyed. I still credit most of the hard times in developing this game to the people who have made hacks for it. Really? :P They slowed this entire process downI thoroughly enjoy this game.

However with the death of around 90% of the hackers the game has finally started releasing good content and frequently doing so. I can only see it going uphill from here on out.,8,I picked up WarZ on day one and it was really buggy but still in alpha/beat so I didn't complain. I've watched it for a while and have recently started playing again. I've been having more fun in Infestation: Survivor Stories as it's now called than I have any many other pvp games in quite a while. It's worth giving another chance if you still own it.,9,I have been playing this game since October 15th. It is to put is simply a great game. Yes it is still a work in progress with new things continually being added but that is what you want in an MMO right? It is a hard game for beginners because it is a survival game and it is now just as much a pve game as a pvp one.

Most people are upset that all the features are not there yet but the ones that are working are great. I have watched this game develop over time and it is still one I am playing daily.,10,The game is great if DayZ came out after The War Z people would be doing this to it. Don't say no because it's true you would be dissing it. COD is a rip off of MOH because MOH was first! That's about much sense you all make with this. Stop with the bandwagon.

I hesitated because of the heat it was under but I regret not getting it earlier this game is great and tops dayz in every single way. Buy it it's worth it and if you go into it unbiased you won't be disappointed.,9,Been playing since alpha and it is an amazing  game with a lot of potential.Do you know why this game is getting bad reviews?IT ISN'T FINISHED!I'm tired of all your negative reviews!The game isn't done yet.Yes hackers run rampant in this game and some of the features are not implemented as of yet.But it will be a best seller as soon as it is finished.Hell the new maps coming out will makeBeen playing since alpha and it is an amazing  game with a lot of potential.Do you know why this game is getting bad reviews?IT ISN'T FINISHED!I'm tired of all your negative reviews!The game isn't done yet.Yes hackers run rampant in this game and some of the features are not implemented as of yet.But it will be a best seller as soon as it is finished.Hell the new maps coming out will make the scores for this game jump real high.So be patient... try the game.It is fun even in it's unfinished state!,8,A very controversial game but the truth is that if Day Z had never existed this game would be a classic. The tip I would say is imagine it as it's own game with no comparison to any other and you will h=enjoy it. The bugs aren't common now and updates keep adding more enjoyable content.,8,I review it from a point with ~15 hours of gameplay to be honest it isnt all that bad as everyone says.  I have ~200 Hours of gameplay on dayz and all i can say is that you should also give WarZ a fair Chance...... I give this Game a fair 8 also keep in mind that it is FAR from complete....,9,There are a lot of undelivered promises with this game and it's no where near polished.

I think the biggest problem with this game is how noob UN-friendly it is. Reviewers like total biscuit had no clue what they were doing and showcased the game in an extremely negative light when it did not deserve such harsh criticism. I actually did not like the game when I started but after I learned how to play properly I quickly changed my opinion. I do agree that it was launched far too quickly on steam but you get a lot for the price you pay. You do not have to spend any money after your initial purchase to enjoy the game. I have been playing for a month and a half and haven't purchased any gold coins. Essentially you get a pretty hardcore multiplayer experience for 15 bucks. There are a lot of bugs it is constantly being patched and they lied a lot. These are not reasons to bury a game that is actually a ton of fun. It is indeed a reason to get a refund if you like though. That being said you will have a lot of fun if you really give this game a chance. It has quite a hard hitting learning curve but nothing gets your heart pumping like being chased by 30 zombies and taking fire from multiple players. That and the fact that if any of those things kill you you are DEAD and you lose everything. That is the single greatest part of the whole game. The mission is to stay alive and dominate your opponents. It's not like another shooter where you're just racking up kills and deaths.,10,I played since alpha and this game is great. Shure it has its flaws (devs beeing one of them) but it still offers the most rewarding and meaningfull PVP experiences ever... its close to EVE in a way it punishes death of your character. The game is smooth and kind of soothing and then in times tense and freakishly intense when you walk into a action or a PVP situation and there is no wayI played since alpha and this game is great.

Dont be a Hipster and just follow the masses try the game and decide for yourself.Givitn it a 10!,10,I like the game but absolutely can't believe how badly the developers treat their community. Launching a 4 hour respawn without talking to the community first and then expecting them to pay to be revived. How can I sell this to my friends???

Right now it does not have that at all.,10,If you're a fan of zombie games just buy the game and don't listen to all those kid haters. It is the first really well made online Zsurvival game. I like it more than DayZ. Also it has not as much similarity as you may think to DayZ.

I have been playing for 20 hours solo and have just introduced it to a pack of my friends. Yes it is similar to Dayz but i had so many issues with dayz that it was unplayable. I also love the slower moving zombies! The game is gorgeous too I spend so much time doing screenshots! there is a lush green environment with thick long grass to use as cover and theInfestation is a great game.

Make sure to get the pack that gives you a little in game currency just to get started.,7,I don't understand the hate this game is receiving yes it was prematurely released and it had a  ton of problems. The key word in that sentence was HAD. This game has had a rough start but despite that it has got better and better. I've read through many posts hating on this game and some points are valid and I agree but many others are belatedly retarded.

I've read through many posts hating on this game and some points are valid and I agree but many others are belatedly retarded. I've seen people hate on this game because it's a copy of dayZ I've got 2 things to say about that this maybe is a copy of dayZ but sure as hell with my experience has less glitchs and bugs than dayZ and second being welcome to the new world where everything is "stolen" from one another. Another major grunge I have is there were 13 critics who reviewed this and tons of users and all the critic reviews are from the early stages of the game and many many user reviews are back from the accidental pre-release which i find is unfair towards the game that it got this  storm and now is getting to it's par and people are holding on to the wrong beginning and not letting go of it. To which I say don't be ignorant and try the game now that it's been out for a while and been fixed. If you don't like it then feel free to disagree but just give it a new chance.,7,The new hardcore servers are the way to play it no global inventory First-Person only one-life characters.

Many guns around nowadays not sure if that's good or not. Lots of fun to be had especially if played with friends. Buy it when it's around U$1000 or less.,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Very good game to play with friends and make clans... very good pvp and good pvei have more than 200-300 hours in this game... better than dayz mod....,7,I bought into this game in early alpha and it has come a long way. I really enjoy the game but they do over promise. Over all it was worth the buy 100% Get a group of friends and the PvP is unlike any other game.

Why don't you guys just face the truth and accept that this game is the master of all games? It is your fate to spread the glory message of how great this game is to the mankind. All hail to the glory of old day WarZ the absolute power over all games in the world.,10,This game is awesome! I love zombie survival games and this is one of my favorite ones! I have played DayZ but I might think this one is a little better! It is always fun to find food water weapons etc.,5,The game is  alright they have been working hard on banning hackers adding bug fixes. But they have moved away from beta and alpha WAY too fast I've noticed them change the buy page on the warz website more then the game.

I do feel mislead on the game There's just something about it that just does not complete it It might be the lack of surviving. You can easily survive in this game The zombies are not that much of trouble. So what is there left to do in the game? Nothing really there's no objective all you do is grab loot and store it in the safe zone. They have advertised this game as a MMO in a MMO there is suppose to be missions right?  So lets face it all you can do that is 'Fun" is killing other players. I find that quite dull. There's so much features that they promised missing I feel like I was lied to. If you have not bought this game yet I recommend you wait for some more things to be added.,5,Here is a honest non biased review.First off I have followed this game even before the forums went live (registered within first 3000 people)I would class my self as a "FanBoy" because of the way they described the game sounded AMAZING. but so far I don't think they have met a single promise. And disappointing very much. They have their priorities wrong and the community tells themHere is a honest non biased review.First off I have followed this game even before the forums went live (registered within first 3000 people)I would class my self as a "FanBoy" because of the way they described the game sounded AMAZING. but so far I don't think they have met a single promise. And disappointing very much. They have their priorities wrong and the community tells them what those are but still. no. They don't listen.- No cars. "yet"- No VOIP! SO IMPORTANT!- Seems like money making. pure money making.- The pre-order packages didn't turn out to be the best value (they promised that)- The map isn't as big as promised and not true to size. They said it would be close to the same size as DayZ without the water(160km). Now they say its 100km.-No private servers yet-Flaws in the system. you need 20 hour game time on a character in order to create a clan. Nice feature but Hardcore characters can't do this unless they are very very good. But also what happens once you delete the character. What happens to the clan?- Way too much banning and deleting threads on the forums and hate. the search function is broke! and people don't add tags!- Animations are still **** Yes I can complain because foundation release was on the 17th.- Hackers are still an issue. All hacks seem to be updated and they need to make it a lot easier to report people (I can't even find the thread with the link where you need to report hackers to)- way too many bugs still. I got killed by a zombie after shooting him in a head 3 times. and I know i hit him.- repetitive areas But to be honest. with friends it's a fun TDM type of game. That's about it though.,10,WarZ is a game that about survival you have to find food water supply weap for survive and survive thousand zombie (Infected) you can make a team to stronger and you can choose to be Bandit Or Lawman killing people for supply or giving people a supply this game is very very awesome  I LOVE THIS GAME  but it's have a some glitch and bug but it's ok,10,The game has a lot of bugs and cheaters but fix everything. Banish those who use booster apologizing for various problems and give gc. I would recommend that fun to play with friends.,8,The War Z is a PvP large-scale map post-apocalypse game. The first thing I have to point out that this game has an abnormal amount of bad reviews which angers me; because this could persuade the creators to stop focusing on the game all together.The game is very stressful if you die you must wait one hour before being able to "revive" your characters unless of course you haveThe War Z is a PvP large-scale map post-apocalypse game. The first thing I have to point out that this game has an abnormal amount of bad reviews which angers me; because this could persuade the creators to stop focusing on the game all together.The game is very stressful if you die you must wait one hour before being able to "revive" your characters unless of course you have purchased in-game money in which you can instantly revive your character. The hour wait is actually not a bad idea as it keeps players from throwing themselves out into the open this means you are better off doing guerilla warfare against players rather than just running around the roads and towns.In this game you can find a huge variety of guns melee weapons and other useful tools. The discouraging part here is that the game does support the "Pay to Win" system where players who buy in-game money can purchase all the ammo they need to slaughter along with body armor. My defense for this however is that you buy this at your own risk if you die you lose everything you bought. (Unless it is kept in storage.)Upon playing for 20 hours you can establish a clan in which you may invite players but you can also form groups with other players which will mark where those players are on the map. Groups can be used innocently to locate allies but be warned; this also reveals your location to other group members a trap waiting to happen.My main issue I come across is not ONE person on this game thinks like me don't even try negotiation with the community they will ALWAYS try and kill you no matter what. Save a player from a zombie? Dead. Give someone medicine? Dead. Find someone with only a flashlight in a city? They will attack you. There is NO cooperation unless you make contact with them through chat long before you actually meet them. So just a heads up from my experience trust noone. I don't blame the game however for this annoying factor however; so I do not deduct ratings for this game because of the god awful community.One complaint is that the zombies will not die from melee weapons easily unless you continue to make headblows you could find yourself whacking a zombie for almost a whole minute before it finally dies. This is bothersome because: A. Another zombie may attack you during this. B. A player may appear and simply kill you while you are doing this. A major flaw in the game but just aim for the head and you should be through them within 5-15 seconds.A typical complaint is that this game is full of hackers this is a little exaggerated by the bad reviewers yes it is common to find them but really...I mean come on just change servers if it is really such a problem it takes about 15 seconds afterall.Another big complaint is "glitches" I personally have not come across any of these glitches but I am sure that I am to find one eventually. This game is still underdeveloped and is working to improve these issues (Unless of course the 2000 bad reviews persuades them to stop. Thanks.) An issue I do see however is that occasionally I spawn right in the middle of a hotzone of zombies which is kind of serious...The blood is insanely unrealistic a flashlight sending gallons of blood into the air? Come on...Overall I am "pleased" with this game but improvements could be made. I still recommend this to other friends of mine as this game is still a great adventure for any zombie apocalypse fan. The biggest thing I hear in every single review is that it is a blatant copy of Dayz. NO DUH XD. But still the two games still have huge differences one has bigger maps has vehicles better graphics. The other has melee weapons helmets an mmo feel to it and skill perks. So for now I wouldn't completely shoot down this game I bought it while AWARE of the fact that it was being encircled by bad reviews and had a metascore of 20 on steam. I do not regret it.,9,Alright everybody looking at this review please don't even pay any mind to the negative feedback coming from most of these people. I purchased this game a few days after launch. Most of these people are very upset over a misunderstanding that occurred in its steam description. They listed features that were going to be added in the future because the game was still in ALPHA. Yeah people IAlright everybody looking at this review please don't even pay any mind to the negative feedback coming from most of these people. I purchased this game a few days after launch. Most of these people are very upset over a misunderstanding that occurred in its steam description. They listed features that were going to be added in the future because the game was still in ALPHA. Yeah people I say that again ALPHA. A simple misrepresentation on steam led the entire world to crash down on this fantastic game. I guarantee if you like zombies and shooters and lots of other players you will adore this game.,7,I don't understand most of you guys you rate the game as it was still in alpha.. The game has changed so much but it's not perfect. But you guys keep giving 0 points but it doesn't deserve 0 because Hackers are gone now. They are trying to make the game better and they are successful.,8,I love this game but there is a lot of hate  i honestly think that it has a lot of potential but you can not be telling me you hate a game just because of hackers! Honestly i am mad about the banning but if you don't do anything to piss off the devs then you will not gt yelled at. Just keep a low profile on servers when your new which means do not use chat. Also to those of you who are madI love this game but there is a lot of hate  i honestly think that it has a lot of potential but you can not be telling me you hate a game just because of hackers!

Also to those of you who are mad about dieing so much and the bugs well think of this have you ever played a game where they have SO many bugs it can not run well think of those 60 dollar games and then talk to me. Also hackers are in every single game... And my last point if you are complaining about being killed by someone who has a gun we all know that you would do the EXACT same thing.,8,This game shouldn't be judged on the incompetence of its team and the mistakes they have made. the game should be judged on gameplay and as far as gameplay is concerned it passes. the game has decent art work and is getting updates frequently. gameplay feels slow compared with other titles and is slightly buggy at times however it plays well.when playing the game with friends youThis game shouldn't be judged on the incompetence of its team and the mistakes they have made. the game should be judged on gameplay and as far as gameplay is concerned it passes. the game has decent art work and is getting updates frequently. gameplay feels slow compared with other titles and is slightly buggy at times however it plays well. when playing the game with friends you get a great feeling for the game and it makes you feel that protecting your friends is life and death. finding something as simple as a tin of ham boosts your spirit and makes you want to find more interesting items up until you get beaten to death by an angry gamer looking for revenge with a flash light. the game has seen a lot of bad reviews from people that haven't even played the game and base there judgement on other peoples reviews. it has also has bad reviews about its rival Dayz. the game is similar to dayz in the way that they are both zombie survivals but they are very different. comparing dayz to warz and saying warz is copying dayz is the same as saying that call of duty copied battlefield they are the same genre and will have similarity's. may rating base only from gameplay is 7.5 (rounded up to 8) If a rating was possible for the makers of warz it would be 2/10 for ruining the reputation of what could have been a successful game by stupid decision making.,10,Seit den neuen Updates ist das spiel besser geworden und ich finde dieses Spiel hat großes Potential wenn die Macher des Spiels noch mehr bug-fixes machen wir dieses Game ein voller erfolg,8,Okay first of all I would like to say that the game The War Z in my opinion is surprisingly good despite the many many many many hateful reviews (which by the way were made when the game was first released not giving the developers time to add fixes). Yes this game has downfalls like most games out there like: hackers glitched surroundings lack of In-game comm etc. But that's theOkay first of all I would like to say that the game The War Z in my opinion is surprisingly good despite the many many many many hateful reviews (which by the way were made when the game was first released not giving the developers time to add fixes). Yes this game has downfalls like most games out there like: hackers glitched surroundings lack of In-game comm etc. But that's the thing everyone points out the flaws in the game they don't look at the good side for example: finding guns is as easy as finding the hay in the needle stack; also everyone says that the game is full of hackers and BM kids when in fact just yesterday I was re spawning and as I was wandering through the forests I found another player who just spawned at first thought i was like "oh god he's is going to unmercifully murder me" but actually he took me to the vault in the safe zone and gave me 4 guns I did not ask for his help I did not ask for anything he just gave them to me. Now I could go on with the list of benefits of playing the game but they are just as long if not longer than the negatives. On to another subject "hackers" I put that in quotes because well frankly every server I go on someone calls out someone as a hacker and yes he could be a hacker but the most probable answer is you just suck. Now I'm not trying to be rude but it's probably the truth I know I suck but every time I die I don't shout out that my killer was a "hacker" that's just childish and makes you look like a bigger fool. And personally if I get called a hacker that would actually bring satisfaction to me because I'm so damn good at killing that people think I have aim bots or whatever hackers use now. One final point I'm going to make is as i was reading some of the User Reviews a lot of people A.) Don't have a clue what they are talking about it because they have never played the game and B.) Say the game lacks originality but that's the thing they weren't looking for "original" they were looking to re-create a stand alone game like Day Z mixed in with some of their favorite game play experiences (which i feel they did an amazing job). Now I know I'm probably not going to get much love but what the hey I'm here to state my honest opinion on how I feel about this game. And my honest opinion is this game though its many quirks is still being developed as the game goes on and if I'm already fully submersed in the wonderfulness that is War Z then I don't even want to know what I'm gonna be like in a couple months! I highly encourage you to get this game despite the many bad reviews it's got don't let the crowd bring you down fight the current it's well worth it. Solid 8/10!!,6,Alright firstly do not flame my review just because I didnt give it 5 and below. I feel that this game has potential the devs besides Sergey who perhaps could be a complete  from what I heard are not doing a money grab and running. They are trying to improve the game. Hacker problems have been controlled very well ever since the addition of Punkbuster in which its still being tackled.Alright firstly do not flame my review just because I didnt give it 5 and below. I feel that this game has potential the devs besides Sergey who perhaps could be a complete  from what I heard are not doing a money grab and running. They are trying to improve the game. Hacker problems have been controlled very well ever since the addition of Punkbuster in which its still being tackled.  Of course this is far from a AAA masterpiece with its many flaws such as poor FPS at times as well as some bugs here and there but the gamebreaking ones have more or less been fixed. If you are willing to look above a few small hiccups you might enjoy this game as I did. I was detered from this game due to the poor reviews and of course the thing i hate most hackers. However ever since the addition of punkbuster and the Steam summer sale i decided to give it a shot hey you cant go wrong for $3.74. I must say i really did enjoy this game. No i am not some guy paid to write such  but i wish i was. I really liked the open world aspect and the merciless pvp is quite unique. Although it would be a rough start as did i have one playing with friends and on private servers made this game much more enjoyable. So as a final note i stand neutral but more to the favouring side of this game. I have no comments for the comparison of it and DayZ. I would say you could try to get it IF you like this genre and have friends to play with. Otherwise my advice would be wait for a sale and get it. You might end up enjoying it. Peace~,6,This game gets far more hate than any game I've ever seen. I feel like the majority of reviews ripping on this game are all due to bugs or cheapness or fraud.

I would like to start off by saying that the company's decisions in no way reflect the quality of the game. Sure their Steam profile had false advertising but if that's what you're mad about then write to the company not the critics. Second of all: this game is very stylized. If you don't want to die or risk items in PvP combat you can't rate it poorly solely off of that. The few points I must agree on however are its developer's lack of attention to seriously game-breaking issues. As an example there was once a glitch which caused players to die for no reason other than walking around. It took the developers more than two days to sort this out when any other online game would've had it fixed (or at least said something about it to communicate with their community) within an hour.,7,First of all This game has terrible design horrible sounds/soundtrack and many bugs (EX: Some rocks sound like metal when you walk on them you randomly start levitating etc.). But I won't lie it is extremely fun. This game brings out the best of the teamwork aspect and communication skills are ESSENTIAL. I like how they made it when you buy GC you can't get ranged weapons.

But I won't lie it is extremely fun. This game brings out the best of the teamwork aspect and communication skills are ESSENTIAL. I like how they made it when you buy GC you can't get ranged weapons. Some people may complain about that but think about it anyone that spends money is just immortal. Also the fact that guns need to be used wisely I think is a realistic factor added. And after reading the critic reviews one critic thought buying ammo for your gun in the store is dumb. I like it just because guns are so rare to find that using one clip means your gun is useless if you couldn't buy ammo. If only they would spend some actual time into developing this game... Overall this game is fun (even more so if you play with friends) and definitely worth a measly $15. I give this a buy! ***NOTE I have not played Day-Z so I can't give a personal comparison of it to War Z.,10,Este juego puede crecer a mejor si los jugadores ayudamos a los creadores a mejorarlo.

You haven't even started playing if 20 minutes is all you played. You wouldn't have found your first decent weapon in 20 minutes. 4) Yes WarZ isn't the 'realistic' game DayZ is and that is totally fine because they are doing something different by making it a bit more casual and wanting to appeal to the people who aren't as hardcore and people that just want to shoot other people for fun. 5) People saying this is a DayZ clone read point 4. Yes without a doubt they made the game because of Day Z's succes but that's what you do in the industry. Something is popular and you follow the trend. On the game itself:It's not a bad game and I thorougly enjoyed myself playing it. I always found DayZ to be a bit too hardcore for me. I liked the scavenging and surviving element  but holy  did it take long. Infestation: survivor stories brings a game that is more casual and accessible for players who enjoy a more arcadey (as I like to call it) experience. Most fun part of the game is joining up in a group and trying to find and fight other groups of players. It's fun because the death statement really means something in this game (contrary to modern FPS).,10,Great game! love the PVP and PVE combat. The fact that you can swim and bleed to death is also just... just great. Hopefully retards will stop hating the game because they don't understand the mechanics and are trying to play it like DayZ.,10,bon jeu de survie en espérant que les développeur prendront soin de ce petit mmo  pour les fan de the walking dead. un peu hardcore c est pour sa que certain noob l on descendu.,10,I just can't understand why are there so many bad comments. I bought the game for 350  and I consider it a good deal. It is giving me a lot of entertainment though i have to admit that the only way to play this game is with friends; it's really really hard and if you play alone can be quite frustrating but when you team up with your friends it's really fun. IMAO those who gave badI just can't understand why are there so many bad comments. I bought the game for 350  and I consider it a good deal. It is giving me a lot of entertainment though i have to admit that the only way to play this game is with friends; it's really really hard and if you play alone can be quite frustrating but when you team up with your friends it's really fun. IMAO those who gave bad ratings just need to play with friends and get a little more skill. It's not an easy game but it has a lot of potential; There are some annoying bugs but in my opinion they don't affect the gameplay.Considering that I paid it 350  i'm absolutely satisfied. I would give it a 75 but i give 10 in order to raise the ratings.,9,Seriously this game is great! i used to think oh this game has a bad reputation so i am not going to buy it but i was like i may as well try it out and i thought it was a good game especially when you play it with your friends. the devs are slowly getting better and making faster progress this games has great potential yes its gonna lose players when dayz standalone comes out but it willSeriously this game is great! i used to think oh this game has a bad reputation so i am not going to buy it but i was like i may as well try it out and i thought it was a good game especially when you play it with your friends. the devs are slowly getting better and making faster progress this games has great potential yes its gonna lose players when dayz standalone comes out but it will still be a great game they are also releasing a new map for it soon so that should be good! but if i was you buy it give it a go i would say its worth the money!,10,It's amazing zombie survival game! You must buy it if you like zombie survival games. Game has got updates every month and becomes better everyday! Such an amazing job,10,The best game ever. I dont know why the people talking bad about it. Its just for pros not for noobs.

And for the beginner a great power is behind this game as shown. Incidentally I apologize for my lousy english.greetings from Germany ^ ^,9,I really like the game the mix mixture between sumulation and arcade is good for me. I really like that you must be on your guard because there's players and zombies. Its hard to explain you really need to give it a go. (With some friends is a plus) and for only 15$ it's great value.,7,this game had many updates and its alright. i would recommend dayz but you have to have a good pc to run dayz.. warz is worth buying but only with friends,10,DayZ fanboys have obviously been here writing negative crap about this game and down-voting user reviews shame on you people for ruining this game's reputation.The game as it is today (September 2013) it works pretty well.

What Else,7,I got the game a long time after its initial release so I'm going to pass all of the bugs and developer issues. The game is quite entertaining and fun with certain criteria being met. You have friends that will play the game with you. Playing this game solo seems a bit boring and pointless in the long run. You don't mind dying. Losing everything you have gathered in the long hours afterI got the game a long time after its initial release so I'm going to pass all of the bugs and developer issues. The game is quite entertaining and fun with certain criteria being met. You have friends that will play the game with you. Playing this game solo seems a bit boring and pointless in the long run. You don't mind dying. Losing everything you have gathered in the long hours after just a few gunshots is something you will face often.You don't mind that there's a huge shop that gives the players advantage if they are willing to pay real mone.You enjoy games that require you to spend a lot of time to collect items and achieve small victories. Personally I meet all the above so it's a 7 from me. I spent a lot of time having fun with a few friends scavenging and fooling around. Keep in mind my opinion doesn't include all the shady things the dev did along with the initial hacker/bug issues.,10,Infestation:survivors stories is just a game that is being improved once or twice a month... game still (BETA) and have big amount of errors and things to fix or repair...I really like this game and I know it is going to be better than DayZ...the moves of zombies atacks actions weapons and map quality....Dont throw this game to the bin before it's finish and improvements ok?Regards,7,Okay so this game has seen bad reviews most of them due to judgement of others but some have some facts. I enjoy this game very much. I have found a few bugs. Some can ruin your character yes but it has some great features as well. One is (according to your opinions) the safe zones. This encourages trading which is a great aspect. It was possible in Dayz but it was very risky. And onOkay so this game has seen bad reviews most of them due to judgement of others but some have some facts. I enjoy this game very much. I have found a few bugs. Some can ruin your character yes but it has some great features as well. One is (according to your opinions) the safe zones. This encourages trading which is a great aspect. It was possible in Dayz but it was very risky. And on the note of Infestation copying Dayz I couldn't disagree more. Dayz is part of (and arguably made a) genre of zombie survival. The developers of Infestation also made a game in this genre. And the zombie A.I. is ALOT better than Dayz. They don't zigzag and run in the wrong direction. I love Dayz but I hate how much of a shadow it throws on Infestation. and Dayz was made before Infestation so it does have more features. And the developers have made alot of mistakes as not including everything they promised but this game is still in development right?,5,The game is not that bad when playing on the Trial Servers were people work together and few snipers are in play but still the map is bland and the game has very little to interest you playing with friends is very fun but the devs are very bad  I am a community Dev myself and I'm am better then them  a new map is on the way but not a big change.

The game has less hackers now but it still feels like a COD with a few zombies added in not worth the $15 but do try the free account but trust no one people will kill you on sight mainly because zombies are such a bore and the shooting is really fun this means more PVP tho and renting a server cost a minimum of 50 USD so playing by yourself is out of the question NPC missions are coming out soon they are very fun  I made them  so people have something to look forward to. JUST PLAY THE TRIAL and tell me what you think,10,Perfect game! I have dumped thousands of hours in to DayZ and this had all of the features I wish dayz had. Unlike DayZ this game is highly pvp oriented and zombies are very unforgiving This makes most of the reviewers hate on this game. When it first came out it was still in beta but they didn't label it publicly causing meta critic to give it one of the lowest scores in history. If thisPerfect game!

MUY RECOMENDADO!,7,Looks like the game has changed quite a bit since the time it used to be called The War Z. I heard it was terrible back then never played it. But played this version it's quite fun to me comparing it to Day Z. I feel it's easier to find people and more like a game than a simulator like Day Z feels. I would give it an 8 or 9 if it wasn't for Punkbuster messing up so often. I think I foundLooks like the game has changed quite a bit since the time it used to be called The War Z.

I think I found a work around but it seems like the best way not to have problems is to just play on the least populated server. But overall it's been a while since I've been interested in a Zombie game that didn't feel boring or just a beat'm up with zombies in it.,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        Este juego a cambiado mucho y cada vez esta mejorando sé que antes habían la de fallos! pero VOTAR nuevamente a este lugar de criticas para apoyarles por la mejora que ha hecho infestation survivor stories.,9,So let me start off with I had to make a review for this because all you DayZ fanboys are giving this game a bad name before even playing it based on "top critic" reviews.  People need to understand that this game is supposed to be difficult it's not supposed to be a chocolate factory walk in a park or a girl scout jamberee it's survival game.  Do you honestly think in a zombieSo let me start off with I had to make a review for this because all you DayZ fanboys are giving this game a bad name before even playing it based on "top critic" reviews.  People need to understand that this game is supposed to be difficult it's not supposed to be a chocolate factory walk in a park or a girl scout jamberee it's survival game.  Do you honestly think in a zombie apocolypse you would find a gun everywhere you look?  Or better yet ammo I mean this game gives you like a 3-5 chance of finding guns and 2-5 chance of finding ammo when in real life you would probably have like a 1-5 chance of finding both of them.  It's supposed to be difficult players are aggressive on this game because it's difficult to find guns this is why the constant killing of players they need other peoples equipment to survive.  You have to play this game for a while and develop a taste for it like i did I got interested in it once I found out how great it is to loot a highly populated place with a buddy always having your finger on the trigger waiting to kill that one unlucky player who gets in your line of fire.  The game is a complete thrill it has a trading system a group system a skill system.  This game does have a lot of things compared to DayZ.  The hatred towards Infestation due to your liking of DayZ just to bash another game is not cool I suggest getting a large number of friends and just chill hangout it's a good game once you get some equipment and it never ends because once you die you can just restack.  Yes the waiting times are devasting but thats the point they did however lower it to 18 mins which is a good wait time.  Infestation isn't a bad game it has lots of potential and I feel that it will be a great game one day seeing constant updates make me happy.  So yeah if you'd like to try it get a trial account then decide if you want to pay for it.  Thank you have a nice day...,8,I think that it's better than DayZ (mod and standalone) in nearly every way. Much better value at least. There are still alot of things left to do so I won't give higher than 8 for now. Please ignore alot of the negative reviews because this was mainly when the game was first released and it wasn't well tested along with problems that the devs caused to try and get on top of theI think that it's better than DayZ (mod and standalone) in nearly every way.

Also alot of people don't like games with in game purchases which is another reason for the bad reviews.,10,I am sorry for those who feel scorned that bought into the game when it was new... BUT... i just paid $3 for this game and have been co-oping with mates for the last 2 days and having a hell of a fun time. Sure its a bit buggy and stodgy in places but I am ranking this game based on its $3 price and for that it is bargain and amazing and have given me more entertainment than some AAAI am sorry for those who feel scorned that bought into the game when it was new...

At its $15 price I would still give it an 8 or 7.5 as long as you have mates to play with.,10,I actually don't understand why people hate it I got it for 3$ and I think even for 15$ it worth the shot.realistic good quality awesome environment sometimes it can be boring when you walk and players are dangerous in game that might be one reason why people dont like it (you can lose all your stuff in seconds but you can save it in settlements too don't worry)plus they are addingI actually don't understand why people hate it I got it for 3$ and I think even for 15$ it worth the shot.realistic good quality awesome environment sometimes it can be boring when you walk and players are dangerous in game that might be one reason why people dont like it (you can lose all your stuff in seconds but you can save it in settlements too don't worry)plus they are adding vehicules it will be even better I can't wait to see that and people saying stuff like:'invisible walls' yes we call it border mapcheaters are banned (i can see it of course there is a lot)its not that buggy and when it is you can blame stupid haters that are ddosing serversclans are freethere are private servers,10,buen juego la verdad solo les falta arreglar los bugs y poner mas updates y seria uno de los mejores del estilo supervivencia nada mas qe dacir recomendado,10,This review contains spoilers click expand to view.        The better game ever made.The problem is the Developper team they are so much bad.If they sell the propriets of Infestation to EA or Microsoft or another the game will respawn.,10,I think this game is amazing and just too underrated it's a good game to play before DayZ standalone is released. it has good graphics good gameplay and a big map got released (california) if you want fun play this game.,10,After the release of colorado v2 mapit change from bad to good..not every game perfectright?.this game are in good direction now.there is no game like this 1st/3rd person mmo survival zombie apocalypse.,10,the game is a bigg  and you ppl complaing r little babys congradutalations u all lick a bick bufalo D!*K if u play oon steam add me if ur not a cry baby tylermc905 :P,9,Bon jeux dans l'ensemble et les développer essayent vraiment d’améliorer le jeux de jour en jour.Beaucoup de médisance sur ce jeux mais les derniers mis a jours et celle a venir améliore considérablement le jeux,10,Do not purchase this game. Many features listed on Steam are completely missing. The price was reduced to less than $15 in order to squeeze as much money from the game before it dies. I repeat: do not purchase this game you will not get what you think you are getting. Just look at the War Z forums to see the problems.,10,That's very sad to treat this game like that  In one year Hammerpoint makes some huge progress in this game.

There were a lot of parts missing in the beginning but in the last year and a half they have consistently updated on a regular basis with 90% positive execution. If you don't like hard core high risk PvP don't play. everyone says its pay to win that's just not true I have never spent a penny in that game and I have moreLets start with this I bought this game for 25$ in alpha to play.

If you don't like hard core high risk PvP don't play. everyone says its pay to win that's just not true I have never spent a penny in that game and I have more gear and kills then most people who payed money to get stuff from the store everything in the store can be found and traded. It is not as buggy as people say. I maybe get one bug a week that I come across. Over all the best updates have been in the last month after a rough start this game has a ways to get back to where it should be but they are working in the right direction. The game costs 3.75$ on sale if that's a rip off for a game that has  some very redeeming qualities then you probably shouldn't be reviewing the game. I do believe there are even trial servers for the game. The game is fun its hard its frustrating and its rewarding. This is a challenging game not a walk in the park I recommend at least checking it out on sale.,8,I realize that a lot of people don't like this game because they think it's a "Rip-off" I can understand that. However I believe this is just as good if not better than Dayz for quite a few reasons. Also note this only relates to the standalone version not the Mod. I played Dayz for quite sometime and I found myself becoming totally bored with the same process; Spawn go throughI realize that a lot of people don't like this game because they think it's a "Rip-off" I can understand that. However I believe this is just as good if not better than Dayz for quite a few reasons. Also note this only relates to the standalone version not the Mod. I played Dayz for quite sometime and I found myself becoming totally bored with the same process; Spawn go through houses find almost nothing rewarding run into a character that has been server hopping for hours Die Spawn Go through houses Zombies run straight through wall Die. I never felt rewarded for what felt like an eternity. So I figured I'd give a new game a try. That's when I ran into Infestation.,9,This game is pretty good I'm not joking at first I thought it was bad but I see that is was worth the 3 bucks. It's just addicting to get more xp to get more skills get more gear and more cash. The game world is large to me so I give the game credit for that. I don't know why people don't change their reviews here they were made in 2012 today in 2014 there were several bigThis game is pretty good I'm not joking at first I thought it was bad but I see that is was worth the 3 bucks.

I don't know why people don't change their reviews here they were made in 2012 today in 2014 there were several big updates that added more features and fixes. I don't see any bugs and glitches only that melee combat does get awkward sometimes and an occasional lag. Graphics I must admit are not so good. I have a strong laptop with a powerful graphics chip but the game lag a little on medium setting while on high graphics setting it lags a lot. Although to me it doesn't matter how the graphics look like this game is fun zombies should be better designed though.

SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!,1,I bought this game early in beta really had a lot of fun with one of my friend we expected it to be a rip off of DayZ which it was but due to Dayz at the time was still just a mod and this looked like it was going to be properly managed standalone game like league of legends. But going into the game there already was signs of a rushed put together project especially in theI bought this game early in beta really had a lot of fun with one of my friend we expected it to be a rip off of DayZ which it was but due to Dayz at the time was still just a mod and this looked like it was going to be properly managed standalone game like league of legends. But going into the game there already was signs of a rushed put together project especially in the forums where nothing seemed professional. I am certain that this game has done its cash grab purposes and will fade away about 4 months ago wouldn't be surprised if the servers get shut down in a year or go to F2P don't buy this game. similar games are out there and are continue to come out each with its unique spin wait till one becomes the crowd favourite and go for that one.,0,Abandoned and turrible. Not worth the hard drive space even. Rather hit yourself in the head with a spiked wooden plank. That might be more fun and interesting,0,If you miss Infestation Survivor stories the fret not Infestation the newZ is available.  Expect the same old gameplay hackers scam devs Sergey Titoff subpar graphics and just one question why?? I don`t recommend the rehash of this game or anything else related to these companies and devs.,2,I didn't review this game.  Never played it but somehow it shows up that I reviewed it as a zero.  So in fairness I will score it a 2 which is apparently higher than it deserves .  I don't know how to remove review scores from my list.,1,Theres alot of rumors around this game I'll just tell you the hard facts. nough people are voicing themselves about the unjust bans DevinH a former mod of the forum was banned for this﻿ reason. Just google Warz bans DevinH. Reason why I don't call that a rumor is because there is some evidence to it.

Just google Warz bans DevinH. Reason why I don't call that a rumor is because there is some evidence to it. Sergeytitov the admin (and executive producer) of the new warz forums gave an apology to the fanbase about us "misreading the steam page" its the worst apology ever. Google Mad Mack warz open letter﻿ he'll outline the unjust bans & bs. But what it comes down to is this. They falsely advertised it saying it had all kinds of features that the actual game doesn't have.. they stole art from Walking Dead and used it in their own promotional campaign. They copy pasted the terms of service from league of legends.. they couldn't even be bothered to make a proper legal document for the bloody game they are trying to sell us.. What it comes down is this...  its boring. It's Dayz with alot of features missing and 1 or 2 convenience features thrown in.,6,Game is filled with hackers like with every other game. But Moderators within the game try to keep the game clean. The game is possible to play for fun and lacks many things that it ''could'' be a good game. Within recent updates they introduced "Hardcore" mode where you get permanent death on that character if you die only first person mode and no global inventory. Overall it canGame is filled with hackers like with every other game.

But I dont recommend it.,3,-Graphics- 5/10. They are not equal to what is being put out today. The graphics are a bit old looking and everything just looks dull. There isn't much variety in between places and everything looks gray. -Performance- 4/10. Luckily it did not slow my computer down so I did not experience lag but boy it was buggy...nuff said.-Gameplay- 1/10. Sadly this is true. I began in the-Graphics- 5/10.

There isn't much variety in between places and everything looks gray. -Performance- 4/10. Luckily it did not slow my computer down so I did not experience lag but boy it was buggy...nuff said. -Gameplay- 1/10. Sadly this is true. I began in the middle of nowhere and only had a flashlight. I wasn't with any other survivors but I was in the middle of nowhere. It took me about 5 minutes to get to the closest city only to be taken down by horde of zombies. With no tutorial or any help I had no idea what to do so I was pressing random keys. Once I died I had to wait for about an hour (If I remember correctly) to play again. So I waited and again I spawned in the same place but I went to less populated city. It was hard to play sadly because it was so appealing to me. -Sound- 4/10. The same zombie sound...Sadly it is higher because who can't go wrong with a moaning zombie? -Conclusion- This game was atrocious. It was on sale on Steam for $3 and I would usually say it was worth the $3 but it wasn't. I have only played it twice and uninstalled it right after. This game seems like it was made for a highschool project. It seems rushed and unfinished and could just be one of the worst games I have played in my lifetime. If it goes on sale for 99 cents don't buy it it isn't worth the money I give this game a generous score of a 3/10.,1,I gave this game a chance but he disappointed me and I regretted buying it. Poor graphics creppy online service and a ridiculous. And besides I could not play at any moment due to bugs in the game. I hate this! It's the worst game I ever played.,7,had fun with the game even if there are some major problems with it..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,0,You know what really inspires faith in the quality of a video game? When its creators have to re-brand it completely in order to escape from the reputation it built up. Think about it. They want you to mistake this for a different game from The War Z entirely. What does that tell you? Everything you need to know.,7,The game is not that bad.Bugs are fixednew anti-hacks are coming and developers still put new things in the game and we will make 2 years of infestation.Looks like they will not abandon the game.,0,No not buy this game just don't. Any reviews you see that are giving this any more than a 3 are probably getting paid by the developers. Since this game's release it has changed very little a lot of the boring game play bugs and glitches hackers and extortion by the developers remains with little attempt to fix them since. Not to mention hammerpoint's appalling business practicesNo not buy this game just don't.

Also the game is very money driven. Players with more money to spend should not be able to have an advantage over others in a survival game. Hopefully Hammerpoint takes that money to make a new game.

The only other issue is the bugs. It is hard to run on entry level computers and has very choppy animations. Textures are very detailed but do not make up for the bugs and animation flaws.,8,The game has come a long way since War Z and all the haters that panned this game so much will eat their words now i'm sure.  Sure it's not perfect far from it.  But if you like huge open world exploration finding loot and killing zombies  people then you'll enjoy this.,7,So I'm german please be patient. This game has a lot of problems that's true. But otherwise it is just so much fun and has a lot of potential. Play this game with friends or in a clan and you'll love it.,1,je donne la note de 1 car ce jeu es coder avec les pied les dev's font n'importe quoi .le jeu banni les compte de maniere aleatoire  un de mes compte a etai banni pour avoir un overlay sur mon teamspeak donc 15  de fichu pour rien apres une semaine de jeu   je deconseil ce jeu,7,TL;DR version down below!!________________________________________________This game had a rough start and i understand people are angry about that but about the time they changed the name to: infestation survivor stories the game improved.

ALLOT i didn't play long before that update.a lot of dayz fanboy's are hating on the game even tough i personally think it's just as good if not better (talking about the mod i haven't played the standalone.) Let's address the title  it received so much hate because it was almost the same as Dayz but if you haven't figured it out it's by the makers of war inc. they never intended to rip off dayz with it's name they just decided to stick with the name war and added the z for zombie you might argue that's a lie but this is based on true information. i personally enjoyed this game allot especially playing it at night with a friend the tension of getting killed is really goodbut there is a problem it was never the zombie's that got us but always the other players. but it's said that the biggest problem was that killing zombies was to easy and required no skill. That's is true for 1 zombie  because when they are hit by a melee weapon their next attack will have a 100% miss rate. making it just mindlessly stabbing it in the face for a few times. and against 2-3 zombies it's walking back hoping you won't walk into another zombie and with more then that you are better of running.but that isn't what you are supposed to do you should avoid them or try to fight them 1 at the time or get your friend to kill one and you another. and what about other player's well they will shoot you at sight doesn't matter if you are armed or not a big problem with it being is that gun's are extremely easy to findand you can just take some from your global inventory (the place you put stuff you found.)pvp is usually a sniper bullet to the brains while you can't see it coming. but other time's it's a epic gunfight where every bullet counts and that's what stands out. just as well the tension you have while walking about. i highly suggest you try out the trial account and then if you enjoyed it buy the full game.it has quite a few problem's but they are still working on it full on.as of the time of making this review they are working on a new map: California which also includes vehicles and new weapons. they keep on adding new content. Summary down below!.________________________________________________TL;DR   great game still some issue's pvp can be overpowered the original release was crapbut this is way better and i think it should have been released just now. it's only 15 dollars. if you are not sure play the free trial. also they are adding a new map and loads of content.,2,Infestation is a good game but it's a copy off dayz and there are so much hackers and bugs. If this game had any differential of dayz I even recommend ...,0,i am giving this game a zero like i am going to give dayz because they are the **** same and here is why: both games have **** graphics both games have clunky and sometimes god awful mechanics both games had a terrible launch and both games have a god awful comunity who just wants to shoot you instead of working together. Honestly i didnt see anything diffrent from this and dayz so whyi am giving this game a zero like i am going to give dayz because they are the **** same and here is why: both games have **** graphics both games have clunky and sometimes god awful mechanics both games had a terrible launch and both games have a god awful comunity who just wants to shoot you instead of working together. Honestly i didnt see anything diffrent from this and dayz so why does dayz get 8 and 9 out of 10 and this gets 1 and 3 out of 10.,1,Graphics are great game-play is smooth but gold coins are required to re-spawn from dieing. The only way to get gold coins is to get some when killing zombies that I've never seen on the game only other online players or purchasing gold coins. The gold coins purchase part sucks I shouldn't have to spend more money on a game after I've already paid for it.

If they got rid of the gold coin part of the game I would play all the time.,4,This game is all pvp. You need a harvesting tool to get wood and stone. You need to get recipes to craft anything.

Besides the fact that the developers started banning people for complaining on the forums about hackers that the developers themselves Challenged people to try and hack them then when the hackers did hack their game the developers simply denied it. I had seen multiple videosThis Game had a lot of promise but once you spent about 30 minutes in it you realized it wasn't worth the money.  Besides the fact that the developers started banning people for complaining on the forums about hackers that the developers themselves Challenged people to try and hack them then when the hackers did hack their game the developers simply denied it. I had seen multiple videos posted on their website of very blatant aimboting and the developers response was to ban the person reporting the hacker. Not just ban them from the forums but permanently from the game. Many occasions they would berate and degrade users on their forums for being babies about getting killed in the game while invisible survivors ported across maps beating you to death in seconds with a flashlight. Also they locked their website forums from anyone who didn't already own the game. So there was no way to ask questions and see if you want to buy the game.. The game itself was 1/6th the size they said it was but yet still boasted that the map was bigger then their self proclaimed enemies DAY Z. Lastely I have seen Dev's show up on a server and spawn weapons in "impossible" places but still semi visible to players.  Then through some strange acrobatic technic's watched players reach these weapons to receive a ban for "porting to a spot that is unreachable" even when video proof of legitimately reaching the loot I would not recommend this game because of the um-professionalism shown in the developers. You can buy the game and be banned for reporting someone cheating or just saying something the dev's don't like on their forums. They have no value for the player what so ever and i question whether they have even played a Video game let alone their own. The game itself is ok at best but it is definitely gear to the "i want an easy way to kill people" type of gamer,0,Este juego es totalmente injugable cansino y está totalmente bugueado. Es un juego totalmente desesperante. Ahorrad vuestro dinero en este tipo de juegos que sólo están hechos para hacer dinero facil. Además está pensado para que además paguemos con dinero real.,
